This not only confirms the already popular theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information such as color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossilized remains would not normally provide.
The feathers of these animals were described by scientists as reddish-brown on the upper side and pale or crimson on the lower side.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed center called the rachis, but other features of feathers, such as spikes and protrusions, have led researchers to conclude that the rachis probably belonged to a later stage of evolutionary development than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flight but perhaps for temperature control or navigation. Although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers suggest that this specimen represents the feathers of an adult rather than a juvenile bird.
Although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, researchers speculate that this specimen represents the feathers of an adult rather than a juvenile.

The suspects are named as Khandjar Baba, Bhutta Khandjar, Rampro Khandjar, Gaza Khandjar and Vichnu Khandjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with a closed face.
Although there were three people in the house, none of them were injured when the car hit him.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalised at James Paget's Hospital, Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adecoya has been charged with the murder of the sheriff's son in an Edinburgh court.
He was remanded in custody awaiting trial and indictment, but any witnesses could have altered the testimony, as his image had been widely published.
This is the usual practice in the UK and elsewhere, but the Scottish courts have a different approach, and the courts have considered the photographs of the publication to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line by publishing photos of the accused".
In general, the Corona administration, which is responsible for the prosecution, informed the journalists that no further comment would be made.
The document touches on the controversy over the borders that Palestine had been willing to establish on the border before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics touched upon were reportedly the future status of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the problems of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the treaty, while the PA agreed to leave it for only five years.
The shooters were to be under the watchful eye of the rangers during the additional pest control test, which was controlled and evaluated for effectiveness.
Qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the NPS's hunter program in partnership with the Australian Shooters' Association (New South Wales) Inc.
According to Mick o' Flynn, acting director of heritage and conservation for the park opposite the NPWS, the first marksman selected for the shoot-off operation received instruction on safety techniques and training in a variety of ways.
On Tuesday, the new nine-member Interim Electoral Council (VIS) was sworn in by Martelli.
This is the fifth CEP Marelli in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission proposed the former general director to resign as part of a package of measures to push the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasionally, violent protests have occurred in the wake of failed elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
There were 60 recorded incidents of burning uncorrected iPods, which resulted in six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the construction.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of heat exhaustion, which the company called "unusual".
The ministry responded that Apple had extended the reporting period "really unfortunate".
The quake struck at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday) in Marián.
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, chased a bus of Hong Kong tourists and held them hostage.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six of the hostages, including children and adults, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who wanted to go to the bathroom.
Liigin followed in his father's footsteps and made a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liiggins began investigating the morning delivery in his spare time.
Her research showed that if we introduce hormones, this speeds up the lightness of the sample.
According to Xinhua, government investigators discovered two onboard "black box" airdrops on Wednesday.
His wrestling colleagues also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer: "Luna was the first king of extreme. My first manager. Luna died two months into the night. She was very special and something. A strong woman".
Dustin" Goldaust" Runnels" commenting that Luna was as weird as I was...maybe even more so in sales...I love her and miss her...I hope she's in the best place".
The number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8% from the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 Federal Election campaign, during which she argued that Australia should become a Republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This view is shared by 34% of respondents, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29% of respondents believe Australia should become a Republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a Republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and in the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaint led to questions about her fitness.
He was unable to take the necessary pain medication, as it was forbidden during the games.
On January 25, 2001, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Several people confirmed this in early February with various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water and organic matter that could have formed on Earth along with the formation and support of life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the Earth, as comets have long been encountering Earth.
The 53-year-old Kuomo, who took office earlier this year, signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and crazy".
He is expected to be elected to the post of president in 2016.
NextGen-FAA claims that the system will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions annually.
It uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and provide accurate information to pilots.
No additional transportation will be available to Wembley, and no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and there is no parking or ground handling facilities.
Due to the lack of transportation, the game was overplayed due to the possibility of the game being forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's owners.
The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, reported the creation of a new species of Galapagos bird on the islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved within two generations, a process that was thought to take longer due to the Darwin endemic, Geospiza fortis, and the vьюрк cactus-immigrant, Geospiza conirostris.
All-round goldwork may be in shapes that are small, wrapped in forms.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be spun and twisted, beaten with a hammer, or turned into a sheet.
It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This chemical is called pnn. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (Hp) in the test chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have been given electrons (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
These will react with the moist outer layer of your hand to form a curious, uniform shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every household had a lavatory connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewerage systems have been found in houses in the Greek cities of Crete and Santorini Minos.
Bathrooms were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of a bathhouse, where men and women were in the same company.
When you call someone who is more than a thousand miles away, you are using a satellite network.
The companion received the invitation in space, then returned it there.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because some of the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a large rocket with a height of more than 100 pounds is required.
The wheel has changed the world dramatically. For us, the wheel has done the greatest thing - it has made transportation much easier and faster.
He brought us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Under them, they eat medium-sized cats, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including homeless domestic cats) that eat large numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, birds, and lizards in excess.
The secret of their success is the basic idea behind the cat, a special job that does not allow each cat to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in groups called pride.
The Pride consists of one to three older brothers and sisters, as well as up to thirty nieces and nephews.
Usually, sisters and daughters form a large family, and the in-laws are closely related to each other.
Lions behave in the pride mostly like wolves or dogs, and are extremely lethal animals, both in their behaviour to the magnificent lions (but not to other big cats), as well as to their prey.
A well-built athlete can climb a tiger (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times with the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar (the genus Panthera).
The tiger's roar is not so much a full-voiced lion roar as a confused, shouted sentence.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and are the smallest of all animals that hunt.
Scientists believe that the Ocelots followed the animals and found them by sniffing them.
They have excellent night vision in the dark, and are also very subtle. Mixing with their environment, the ocelots hunt for their prey, and then attack their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, by crossing a mountain ridge or a river, or by moving to a new island from which it is not easy to return), they often end up in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are other and different competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations to be a strong competitor to the old.
The original population is still quite immature, and still needs to adapt as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less like the other population.
Eventually, in a thousand or a million years, the two peoples will be so different that they cannot be called the same.
We call this process species formation, which simply means the emergence of new species. The formation of species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb (i.e., inhale) the carbon dioxide that humans emit.
Plants use photosynthesis to make food from the sun, and they provide shade.
Plants are what we use to build our homes, we use plants to make our clothes, and we use plants to make most of the food we eat.
The Mozaurus was considered the highest predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing but other mozaurids.
Its long jaws contained more than 70 sharp teeth, and the upper part of its mouth had more teeth, so that no creature that cut its way could escape it.
Although we do not know for sure, it is likely that its tongue was split in two. Its main food was the great horned owl, large fish, and other mozaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It attacked any creature that entered the water; even the giant dinosaur, the tyrannosaur rex, was unable to resist it.
Although much of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had some peculiar or original holiday dishes, including swine, tauis, rats, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the common people and women sat at the table, the rich liked to have a table together, where they could rest and eat.
Ancient Roman cuisine was not able to incorporate foods imported into Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
The people sacrificed to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with festivities and festivals.
Each of these had an open courtyard and, beyond that, the inner sanctuary, into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramidal towers were built as part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women hid in front of the doors; the stalls facing the street were shops.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Grey is said to have been exiled from Iceland for murder, then to have gone west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite its opening, it was inhabited by Eskimo tribes at the time.
Although each country is a "Scandinavian country", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have had many differences in their history, people, kings, and customs.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a note on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" appear on the back of the Declaration of Independence, which is a caption at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was originally wrapped for safekeeping.
So it is possible that this mark was added as a sign.
The landing on D-Day and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the viši French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what became known as Operation Dragone.
Within two weeks, the American and Free French forces had turned to the Germans, liberating southern France.
A civilization is a large group of people who live and work together in a cooperative manner, a society with a shared culture.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning citizenship, cognate with the Latin civis  citizen; and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines to some extent the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of a civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, the preservation of cultural traces, and the equitable distribution of knowledge.
Secondary cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states for the first time failed to form a central government, the only component of which, according to the Articles of Confederation, was the Congress.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and, lacking a state executive or judicial system, it relied on state power, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
He also had no authority to repeal the tax laws and tariffs of the other states.
The Articles required unanimous consent of all the states before amendments could be introduced, and the states were so loosely bound to the central power that they often had no representatives.
The Italian national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports, in which Italians compete in international games and Olympic competitions, are especially popular in the northern regions.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of Japanese islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical position.
Taiwan traces its origins to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilya Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company, with the initiative of changing the methods of grain production used by the indigenous people, founded a base in southwestern Taiwan and hired Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644  1912) forces took control of the western and southern coastal regions of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894  1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Simonoseki, which granted Japan sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common format for still image photography in the world is  35 mm, which was the predominant size of film at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but most importantly, its aspect ratio is a legacy of the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format, although it may seem odd, is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Thus, the aspect ratio of this format (to divide all integers by twelve to get the simple ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS group of formats) are equivalent or close to this aspect.
The often-ignored and often-ridiculed rule of thirds  is a simple utility that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
It states that the most suitable location for the main object is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see Example).
The Catholic Church, which was considered rich and powerful during this period of European history, attracted particular attention.
Despite the differences in customs and languages, Christianity has united European countries for over a thousand years.
From the common man to the king, this combined force affected everyone.
One of the fundamental tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to help the poor, and this is the purpose of the church's funds.
The central authority of the church had reigned in Rome for over a thousand years, and many felt that such a concentration of power and wealth was not conducive to the fulfillment of that law of religion.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international treaties over the last two centuries, the strategy proved effective, cutting off vital war and civilian supplies.
The British laid mines in international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire regions of the ocean, posing a threat even to neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and peoples were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former business manager) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a distinctive way of representing different periods of time; each period of Chinese development or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between each dynasty, with the division of provinces, the most famous of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China: thousands of people died fighting for the highest position in the famous palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and eager to succeed.
The same is true of the military, as army ratings are now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcended the boundaries of the material world. He frequently visited the cave known as Hira on the Mount of Light for meditation.
The cave itself is preserved from that time and gives a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it, even for someone who knows it exists. Once inside the cave, you are in complete isolation.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World to have survived to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of a number of large pyramidal structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, or Gizot necropolis, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid  being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper concave sign  is the letter V, while the lower concave sign  is a dagger or a square with a lower face.
The upper one means that you should start from the back and push the bow, and the lower one means that you should start from the bow (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow is usually soft, while the lower bow  is stronger and more reliable.
Do not hesitate to make your own markings with a pen, but remember that printed markings serve music and should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 in a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in a crew surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and shouted at the king and queen.
A crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their crews.
At one point, one of the group shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military costs of the US imperialism in the occupation of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover the costs and a large part of the interest on the bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the high profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the order.
The period in which the events take place is usually called the Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending conventionally around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a very wide range of practices, from the technological impulse or imperative to the logic that human destiny is based on scientific laws and their reflection in technology.
Interpretations of technological determinism are based on two assumptions: first, that technology develops independently of the influence of culture and politics; and second, that it affects natural society, not social society.
For example, it would be fair to say that the automobile will undoubtedly lead to the development of roads.
The construction of an international road network for a few cars was not economically viable, so new methods were developed in the field of automotive production to lower the cost of automobile ownership.
The increased use of automobiles has led to an increase in accidents on the roads, which in turn has led to the development of new methods of treating injured people in the field of health care.
The element of cultural determinism in Romanticism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Schlegel, was considerable.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped personalities, and over time, customs and cultures were formed that were tied to this geography, and that were better in harmony with their place in society than with arbitrary laws.
The modern capital of fashion is Paris, while in the Middle Ages it was Constantinople.
Its fame as an epicenter of wealth lasted from about 400 AD to 1100 AD.
The status of the city was somewhat lowered during the twentieth century, as silk and spices were carried back from the Crusades, which were valued much higher than what was sold in the Byzantine market.
By this time, the fashion capital had already moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The heyday of Gothic architecture was between the 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of the communication routes, the western styles may have been 25-30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and the Crusades had led to the use of buttons to hold clothes.
Natural agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural agriculture  uses seeds grown in an ecoregion, a simple, more often organic system, a seed rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture, and this is still the case in most developing countries.
Subcultures are groups of people who disregard the norms of society and develop a sense of their own identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the sex of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as an independent entity may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a mixture of factors.
Members of a subculture often communicate themselves through a style that is distinctive and uses symbols, incorporating fashion, manners, and argot.
One of the most widely used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is the use of a series of failed examples of children who are not socialized because they are neglected, unhappy, or harshly treated by adults.
Such children are called фераль or feral. Some children are restricted by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the parents reject the child because they do not accept the child's mental or physical disability.
Children who are attacked may suffer severe abuse or injury before they are abandoned or run away.
The rest were allegedly raised by animals; some were said to have lived independently in the wild.
When raised by a nonhuman animal, a feral child exhibits behavior (within the limits of its physical capabilities) that is almost entirely that of a caring animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although the project-based learning approach was intended to make teaching easier and more interesting, construction publications were ahead of the curve.
Construction literature  is not a teaching method, but rather a support for people learning something new, such as using new computer technology or starting a new project.
Publications can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is the form of the publication, like the glue man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual publications are embedded in software and are designed to ask, teach, and explain procedures that are difficult for the reader to work on alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to cruel treatment and even intimidation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment without care, education, and nurturing, but they do.
We consider the system of paternity as a safe zone for these children.
Our system of patronage should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The adoptive family was supposed to provide them with everything they needed that was not available in their former home.
The Internet is a vast and integrated network of communication elements.
The specific differences of the Internet have led to the discovery of additional dimensions such as conditions of use and methods of incentives.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have also been found to be important motivations in Internet use (D. James et al. 1995).
In their study of audience reactions to websites, Eimy and McCord (1998) identified the terms "personal engagement" and "long-term relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-signs, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that correctly interpreting a person's micro-secret can reveal whether the person is lying.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks showed that people who cannot understand a speech because of brain damage can still judge sincerity.
He even speculates that such abilities to understand human behavior may be inherent in domestic animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variability: hidden and open.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, which selection removes from the open pool of variation.
Segregation and recombination move variations back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human would have difficulty satisfying its need for amino acids at the expense of the plant resources it could use.
In addition, failure to meet this need can lead to serious consequences, such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
Proteins in leaves and beans would have plant resources to use, but primates like us would have difficulty processing them without preparation.
Animal products (ant, termites, eggs), on the other hand, are not only easily digestible but also rich in proteins, which are all essential amino acids.
Given all the circumstances, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their own "safe-food" problem more wisely than the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the purposeful awakening during a normal period of sleep and then falling back asleep after a short period (1060 minutes).
This can be done with a silent alarm clock, which will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you have reset the alarm clock during bedtime, you may want to move it to the other side of the room so that you do not have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), forcing the person to stand and urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the level of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the possibility to achieve absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve inner enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is expanded by the Mahayana of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
The core of Tibetan Buddhism is simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of inner illumination) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Divine Yoga is the center of Tibetan medicine, where the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates a luminescence of consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the separation of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last another 40 years, and it would be fought by real proxy forces from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope of re-organization was to retreat to the Romanian plazas.
However, these plans were abandoned after the Soviet Union invaded the country with over 800,000 Red Army soldiers, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
The use of transport ships is currently the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The job of a navy is usually to ensure that your country can provide you with the ability to transport your men and goods, and to prevent your enemies from transporting their men and goods.
One notable example of the latter is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and materials across the Atlantic to support the British.
At the same time, the German fleet, using mostly submarines, tried to stop the movement.
With the Allies defeated, Germany might have conquered Britain, as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes domesticated them to make it easier to obtain milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were mainly herded, and were often kept on hillsides and other pastures by herders, often children or young people, whose methods were similar to those of the well-known herders. These methods of herding are still widely used today.
The conca was first made in England in the 16th century.
Although the conca consisted of simple wooden boards laid out in parallel, it was slightly better than the rough roads, allowing the horses to gain greater speed and carry larger loads.
At first, the spokes were only used to secure the rails, but gradually experts came to the conclusion that a metal strip over the rails would be more useful.
This was commonly used, but the iron overlays of the rails caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out quickly.
The first railway was opened in 1767.
The earliest form of human locomotion is walking, which humans first began to do two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (the upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as they had done before.
Two-legged individuals have been found among the fossilized remains of an Australopithecus that lived between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the salehanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering, we can be better for the environment, join environmental movements, or even become activists.
It's like treating symptoms in many ways, but if we don't want temporary solutions, we have to get to the bottom of the problem and eliminate the root.
It is clear that the world has changed dramatically as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and that problems are increasing as a result of overpopulation and humanity's increasingly frugal lifestyle.
After being adopted by Congress, on July 4, the draft manuscript, signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing office, located a few blocks away.
In one night, about 150  200 copies of what are now known as "Dunlap broadsides" were made.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 copies of the Danlepp manuscript that have survived to the present day are considered the oldest copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs, which we call birds, are still alive today.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs, since birds have wings and can fly.
However, there are many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have claws and jaws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs, like the T. rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two possible meanings , namely 0 or 1, which are called binary numbers or, when using computer jargon, bits.
Symptoms such as vomiting are common and cannot be diagnosed quickly.
The best indicator of internal intoxication may be an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for a clear instruction manual on how to give first aid to this poison.
The term "brown" is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the frequent encounters with bed bugs, which are parasitic insects on humans.
Like the killer whale, the bed-bugs nest or live in the nest of their host.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosed in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young to middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is not their primary goal or is not in the best interests of the child.
These couples can make an adoption plan for their children.
In the process of adoption, the child's biological parents are deprived of parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to discover how the world is constructed by means of the scientific method, which in practice provides the direction for most scientific research.
However, this approach is not unique to experimentation, where experimentation is used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to conduct observations, which also provide a direction for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible and the Latin texts.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the need for Greek language learning decreased, Western scholars became disconnected from Greek philosophy and scientific roots.
Most of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are governed by the internal cycles and their corresponding work on the biological clock.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external stimuli, have been found in many animals, bacteria, fungi, and plants.
A biological clock is a self-acting generator that continues its cycle of free cycles regardless of the presence of external triggers.
Hershis and Chase's study was one of the first major hypotheses to prove that DNA is genetic material.
Hershy and Chase used phages, or viruses, to transfer their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label DNA inside the phage, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the protein of the phage.
Depending on the type of mutation, the changes can have different effects depending on the circumstances, such as the importance of the genetic material that causes the mutation, and the presence or absence of embryonic lineage cells.
A mutation can be inherited only when it occurs in the cells of the embryonic line, while a mutation elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is especially interesting to those who travel to natural places to admire the beauty of the landscape and to observe the flora and fauna.
Outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and gathering information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting the island of Borneo to photograph and study orangutans.
Every morning, people would get into their cars and leave their small provincial towns to go to work, where they would encounter traffic in the opposite direction.
In this dynamic transport flow, everyone is in some way connected to and contributing to the automobile-based transport system.
Today's science clearly demonstrates how this large coal economy has reversed one of the stable conditions in the biosphere that has contributed to human evolution over the last two million years.
Almost everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed lands, you may rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or the damage to bridges.
Why is the transport system so dissatisfied, why does it face daily challenges? Is it that the knowledge of transport engineers is lacking? Or is there some fundamental problem?
Transport flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one place to another and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to study traffic flows, as it is impossible to predict the behavior of a driver with a hundred percent probability.
Fortunately, drivers often act in a predetermined sequence; therefore, the flow of movement has a known sequence that can be approximated by mathematical methods.
To better describe the flow of motion, three important relationships are studied: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These connections are helpful during planning, construction, and road facilities.
The first creatures to take to the air were insects, whose ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and more efficient in finding food and work.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their backs.
The birds are able to find shelter from predators in the open air.
Today, there are only two insects that cannot fold their wings on their backs: the needlefish and the water-nose.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some believe that this is true, but most believe that the solar system revolves around the Earth along with the Sun.
It seems very possible, because you don't notice that the Earth spins, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the largest river in the world by volume, with a volume of water eight times greater than that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, reaching six miles wide in places.
The Amazon River accounts for 20 percent of the water discharged into the sea by the world's rivers.
The main part of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long, and is fed by thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were unsurpassed in size or quality of construction.
Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments built by their ancestors, which were thought to be thousands of years old at the time.
The Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the smallest independent state and the least populous country in the world.
Italian is the language used for legislation and official communication in the Vatican.
Italian is also spoken in the daily life of most government employees, while Latin is spoken mainly in religious ceremonies.
Most of the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been aware of the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, due to their occurrence in nature in their original forms and their relative ease of extraction with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the great philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made of one or more of the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
Most of this is related to the four states of matter (in the same order)  solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, and he also postulated that these four states could be transitioned into new types of matter to form the bodies we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Note that the periodic table contains many elements.
Calcium and potassium are considered metals, although there are also metals such as silver or gold.
Among the alloys, you can also find small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter in the universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a dot at the end of this sentence can hold trillions of atoms.
Thus, the pen has become a good friend to many since its invention.
Unfortunately, with the development of new forms of writing, the pen's status declined and its use became rare.
Today, people can write messages on computer screens without even touching a pencil sharpener.
It is difficult to imagine how the keyboard will change in the future.
The essence of the atomic bomb is that it requires a lot of energy to make a nuclear nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
This is like turning a heavy cart upside down, and each time the nucleus splits, some energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they can crack even under a slight jostling.
The Moon's surface is covered with rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the lunar crust is about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is shallower in the lowlands and thicker in the foothills.
The lower surface of the Moon may have more seas, which may have facilitated the upwelling of lava.
Content theories are based on the search for what people are interested in and what they like.
These theories suggest that each person has certain desires and needs that he or she acquires as he or she grows.
These theories try to explain what motivates people to want to do something and what environmental conditions compel them to do or not to do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Gertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, managers exhibit two types of behavior when managing their former colleagues: At one end of the spectrum are those who want to remain "our own man".
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining order, improving performance, allocating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the leader becomes unrecognizable, wanting to change the whole group's work on his own.
After this, the leader is considered to be the most responsible for the successes and failures of the group's work.
This often leads to conflict between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual commands have the same quality standards as regular commands, although there are some differences.
A virtual team often acts as a means of communication for a physical group.
They often have more autonomy than the normal members of the team, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, and may not satisfy their local supervisors.
The existence of a real "secret group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is another difference from virtual teams.
A secret group is a team of members of a local leadership team who set standards for everyone on the team.
Why does an organization put so much effort and time into introducing this process of learning history?
If all functional departments use fewer resources, creativity and resourcefulness are dispersed throughout the organization.
As a result, meeting customer needs creates a new innovative process as the organization works together to overcome obstacles.
To be called innovative, the organization must have a culture of innovation, along with the leadership to disseminate knowledge and organize training within the organization.
The continuum approach is defined by Angel (2006) as a method used to help an organization increase production.
Neurobiology data physically support the study of cognition, and thus help to broaden and refine the field of study.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the main hypothesis supporting the researchers.
It has long been known that spinal injuries, trauma, and cancer directly affect human behavior.
The development of new technologies has enabled us to study brain structures and processes that no one has seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models, thus helping us to understand many of the processes that take place in the brain.
Although it has a science fiction flavor, AI has created a very important branch of informatics that deals with machine learning, training, and intellectual adaptation.
Research in the field of AI includes the development of machines to automate tasks that require conscious reasoning.
The duties include control, planning and scheduling, responding to customer complaints and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice and facial expressions.
These things have become separate disciplines that are aimed at solving real-life problems.
Currently, AI systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the armed forces, as they are incorporated into several software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of any learning process, and often the teacher wants to take the children to places where buses are not available.
The technology offers virtual excursions, where students can sit in their classrooms and view museum exhibits, an aquarium, or a piece of fine art.
A virtual tour is also a good way to discuss your trip and share experiences with your future classmates.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about a trip to the state capital each year, which is updated, but the old version is kept on the Internet and serves as a sample album.
Blogs can also help students write better. Students often make grammatical and spelling mistakes when starting a blog, and users usually correct them.
Students are often critical users, so the blog author tries to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging forces the student to better understand the world around them, and to arouse interest in the user, they are encouraged to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school setting.
Proper use of blogs allows readers to be analytical and critical; responding to the demands of the Internet, readers can define their own position in the context of other works, as well as form their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's bilingual capital, with numerous art galleries and museums that showcase the country's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and farther north is the hub of Muscoca's untouched natural beauty.
All of this is typical of Ontario, which is considered part of Canada by foreigners.
Large areas to the north are sparsely populated, and some areas are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
This comparison is surprising to many: there are more African Americans in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest and most independent continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs introduced Islam, which was widely practiced in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India through the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All of them are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (unless it seems too expensive).
Women should be aware of cultural differences: they may be followed, they may be held, they may be pushed around, they may be pushed around, they may be pushed around.
Be firmly opposed to men and do not be afraid to be firm on your word (whether it is a cultural difference or not, but it is not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marines under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco built the city as Darul-Medina, and it received the name of Casablanca from the Spanish merchants who founded the trading bases.
There is nothing interesting to buy in Casablanca.
Around the Old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as stone, clay, leather goods, callions and souvenirs are sold, but they are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
Goma was devastated by lava from the 2002 eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, leaving many streets, especially the city center, under lava.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is necessary to make a careful observation to know the status of the ongoing hostilities in the province of North Kivu when leaving Goma.
The city is also the base for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest routes in Africa to observe mountain gorillas.
For short distances, the usual (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant place, as it is not easy to visit.
Today, Timbuкту is a poor city, but it is known as a tourist town and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the desert sands.
This was one of the main points of Henry Louis Gates's PBS program "The Unique Wonders of the African World".
The city is distinctive in that it has more of an Arab than African color.
The Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 parks, each of which contributes to the conservation of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions, and is considered the country's flagship of the National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a fee is charged for maintenance and entry.
It may also be profitable to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to some or all of the national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is considered by many tourists to be the main attraction.
The aligned buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong can be compared to a glowing histogram that indicates the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon Coast.
Most of the buildings on Hong Kong Island are built on the northern coast in a dense area of land that has been heavily watered.
This is a place where the British colonies have made their mark, and if you are looking for evidence of the earlier colonial years, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest belt of coastal mangrove swamps, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coast of Bangladesh and India to remote areas.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is designated as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps, but also the remnants of the once mighty jungle that covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km2, of which about one-third is water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the land of Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 head of royal bengal tigers and 30,000 head of spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (via the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumtang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are often full, so tickets should be purchased several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
A shared taxi is a quick and convenient means of getting to nearby places such as Paro (No150) and Punakha (No200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapok River and connects the cities of Oyapok in Brazil and Saint-Jorge de l'Oyapok in French Guinea.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, with two lanes measuring 378 meters long and 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when construction of the Brazilian customs points is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, settling as semi-nomadic hunters, as well as engaging in natural agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of local tribes such as the Guaykurus and the Payaguas, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly known as the "giant province of India", Paraguay was founded in the 16th century as a result of a conflict between Spanish invaders and the local people.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
News about the tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches can be found on the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equal to one British Pound (GBP).
The money could be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and payments can often be made with Stanley credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, and British and U.S. currency may be accepted; please check with the owners in advance to determine the most convenient payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer here when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no separate "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wildlife is already wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park administration says that be at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals!
No matter how obedient they may appear, bison, moose, bears, and almost any other large animal can be aggressive.
Dozens of people are injured each year because of the lack of social distancing. These animals can be large, wild, and dangerous, so let them go.
In addition, be aware that the smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Uполу, with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and about 200 men from the United States and Germany were lost.
A peaceful meeting in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement led to the death of the chief leader, Tupua Tamase, Lealofi III.
Due to its location between two harbors, Oakland has a large number of beaches, the most popular of which are located in these three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific coast, stretching from Long Bay to Devonport.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and many are covered with pohutuкава trees that provide ample shade.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the heart of Oakland, in the prestigious neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St. Helier's, in the Waitemata Harbour.
Some are popular beaches for family vacations, with many shops along the coastline, and swimming is considered safe.
The main local beer is  Number One, which is not complex, but is delicious and heartwarming.
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more expensive.
The tap water is safe to drink, but if you are afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
The idea of flat white coffee is foreign to Australians. short black espresso, capucino are offered with stacked skim milk (rather than foam), while tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian standard. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many trips to the reef are organized year-round and injuries associated with these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the direction of the administration, follow all instructions, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been found near beaches and in estuaries as far north as 1770 from October to late April, although they are occasionally found outside of these times.
Sharks are also present, but they rarely attack humans, and most of them would swim away in fear of humans.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, with their main nesting sites being north of Rockhampton, on the banks of the river.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Most travel agents deal with individual hotels, but you can also find other types of accommodation through the agent, such as camping.
Tour agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can reserve a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
Any corrections or requests should be sent first through a travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
Some festivals, such as music festivals, have a large number of participants who choose to camp on site, and most participants consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you should arrive early to get a place at the campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that while the main stages may have music over, there may be sections of the festival that have music playing all night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can be very noisy for people who are very tired.
Saint Petersburg cruises include the time in the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually make a great effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They have special offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and in their rooms.
Some venues offer alcohol, but alcohol impairs thinking, and all good players know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone who is about to travel in high latitudes or climb mountains must take into account snow, ice, and cold temperatures.
There is little friction on icy and snowy roads, and you cannot walk as you would on bare asphalt.
During a storm, snowfall can be sufficiently heavy to cause a sinking in a very short time.
Other possible causes of visual impairment include snow, a blizzard, or the rolling of car windows or ice.
On the other hand, in many countries, ice and snow are commonplace, and movement is generally uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is perhaps the most fascinating part of Africa and the most memorable experience for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to a trip across dry land to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "forest walk", "walking safari", or "walking safari") is a series of walking tours lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo was the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games in 1964.
If you booked before the announcement of the postponement of air tickets and accommodation for 2020, you may be in trouble.
The cancellation policy varies, but most of the coronavirus-based bans in late March will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The majority of tickets for the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets are expected to cost around 7,000 yen.
The wet clothes will help him to stay warm. In many hotels, it is possible to rent a mat and matting board, even if it is not in the room.
If you do not want to wear a pair of socks without a toe or a toe, try to use a fence.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (something may sit or burn).
There are many different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some regions, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, so if you have problems, you should consider buying water in a hermetically sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar in their region.
Pests can cause food spoilage or irritation, in the worst case, allergic reactions, poisoning, or infection.
Animals that are potentially dangerous for infectious diseases or forcible killing are not generally considered pests.
Tax-free trade is the practice of buying goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes leave behind a considerable amount of money, especially on goods such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fermont is the most difficult to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburg Road, which often passes through heavily wooded, isolated terrain.
If you are not used to walking on country roads, be careful: there are many steep slopes, narrow strips and sharp turns.
The recommended speeds are much lower than in the preceding and following sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict adherence is more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, the cell phone connectivity is much better here than in many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
The German pastries are excellent, and in Bavaria, as in their southern neighbor Austria, the dishes are rich and varied.
Fruit pastes are common: apples are cooked all year round, and cherries and plums are available in summer.
Many German bakeries have jam, fondue, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but tasty and nutritious meal, try the regionally-dependent berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krappen.
Curry is a herbal and confectionery-based snack, served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions, coconut milk is usually used.
17 000 islands to choose from is a general term that encompasses the wide variety of local cuisines that can be found throughout Indonesia.
However, if used without additional definitions, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently, Javanese cuisine is widespread throughout the archipelago and includes many simple cooked dishes, but most Javanese include spicy peanut, chili, sugar (Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle is a pole that hangs from the back on either side of the saddle for the rider's feet.
They provide stability for the rider, but are also dangerous because the rider's foot may get caught in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but his foot remains on the bridle, the horse may be pulled out of the race. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
First, many riders wear shoes with smooth heels, smooth, narrow soles.
In addition, some riders, especially English riders, have a protective arch that allows the leatherback to fall off the rider if the falling rider is pulled back.
The valley of Cochamo, known as the Yosemite Valley in South America, is the most important alpine rock-climbing site in Chile, with its large granite walls.
The peaks provide spectacular views from the top of the mountain. Alpinists from all over the world are constantly laying new routes between the boundless potential of the walls.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skiing or snowboarding on snow with skis attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and amateurs, sometimes known as "ski-lovers", spend their entire vacation planning to ski somewhere.
The idea of skiing is very old - rock paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski travel: This is also called skiing or ski tourism.
This is close to, but not usually associated with, ski tourism or alpine-style alpinism, the latter of which is conducted on steep slopes and requires even tougher skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as a kind of hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover several large distances compared to walking, but you will rarely be able to reach the speed of heavy backpack racing skis on ready tracks.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries requires multiple visits to visa and passport control.
However, the Schengen area operates as one country in this respect.
When you stay in this zone, you can, as a rule, cross the border without having to pass the passport control points again.
It is not necessary to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries, which saves time, money and documents.
There is no universal definition of what objects are antiques, and some tax authorities consider antiques to be goods older than 100 years.
There is a geographic variation of this designation, where age restriction is more important in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade items can be classified as antiques, even if they are mass-produced goods.
Reindeer farming was a source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture that surrounded this trade was also important to many other professions.
However, even by tradition, not all Saami were engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived by fishing, hunting, etc., and used the reindeer mainly for spinning.
Today, many Saami are modern craftsmen. Tourism has become a lucrative source of income in the Saami.
Although the word "gypsy" is particularly common among non-Gypsies, it is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If travel advice is issued to the country you are visiting, this may affect your travel medical insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
You can also consult with governments other than your own, but their councils are for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens may encounter situations in the Middle East that are different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
A consultation is a brief description of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, generalized, and simplified compared to the full information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a general term for any dangerous weather event that may cause damage, serious social violations, or human casualties.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many different types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, rainfall, and forest fires are just as much a form of severe weather as thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include thunderstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the dangers of weather affecting the area, as they can affect various travel plans.
Anyone who wants to go to a country considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Hostile environment" will likely yield the address of a local company.
The course usually explores all the issues discussed here in much more detail, taking into account practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, first aid and sometimes weapon handling.
Books and magazines devoted to survival in the wild are common, but there are few devoted to the war zone.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for return.
In different countries, the government may have different views on issuing gender-blind passports or special papers to match the desired name or gender.
In foreign countries, the willingness of governments to approve such documents also varies.
Following the events of September 11, 2001, the inspection process at checkpoints was further tightened.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should be prepared to give full information about themselves, even if they have lost some credibility in the process of undergoing the examination.
A wave is a current of water that starts at the shore and then returns by crashing into a reef or similar place.
Depending on the underwater topography, the returning wave is concentrated in several deep places, where a deep and fast water current is formed.
Most deaths occur when people swim against the current, sometimes to the point of being unable to swim out.
Even after being released from the current, it may seem difficult to swim back to shore.
Depending on your situation, try to get out of the water safely, perhaps waiting for rescuers to see where you are before they arrive.
The return shock may begin earlier than the cultural shock (which has a shorter honeymoon period), last longer, and be more difficult.
Travelers who adapt easily to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you may have lost some of your cultural traditions and have adapted to a new culture.
When you first go to a foreign land, people may be tolerant, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new environment.
The need for patience and understanding may be less obvious to people who are returning from a trip.
The most interesting entertainment for children at the pyramids is the sound and light exhibition.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and can see them in silence before the show begins.
The story of sound and light is like a collection of stories, but the story of the sound and light is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx is a narrative of a land and a long history.
The visions descend on the pyramids and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and are home to numerous bases, sixteen of which are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island, which is the location of the Villa Las Estrellas estate.
Others include Deception, where the still active volcano's submerged caldera forms a magnificent natural harbor with the island of Livingston.
The Ellsuort Land is the region in the south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellinсгаusener See.
The mountains of the peninsula join the plateau here, then emerge again, forming the 360-kilometer-long chain of the Ellsuort Mountains, which are split in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Ridge, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, Mount Vinson, which reaches 4892 m.
In remote areas where cell phones are not available, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones do not generally replace mobile phones, as you need to be in an open area where you can be seen by a satellite to talk on the phone.
This service is used most often by shipping companies, including vessels carrying vacationers, as well as expeditions requiring long-distance data transmission and voice communication.
Your local telephone provider should be able to provide additional information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who plan to take a year off is to travel and read.
This is especially convenient for school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before entering university without harming their studies.
In many cases, enrolling in a one-year foreign course may actually increase your chances of obtaining a higher education in your home country.
As a rule, participation in these educational programs is charged.
Finland is a great place to go on a boat trip. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, either in the middle of the lakes or in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in an archipelago or on a lake.
Although the coastal archipelagos and some lakes are usually large enough for yachting, smaller boats and kayaks are more interesting to travel on.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is the same as the numbers in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is unique in that it is not the same in other countries (for example, in the Netherlands, the number of boats is one forty per person).
Most of the unique cruises around the Baltic imply a long stay in the Russian city of St. Petersburg.
This means that you can sleep on the ship at night and spend a full day or two in the historic city.
If you only use the boat excursions to reach the coast, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be dangerous for people of any age and experience, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced an injury.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes that many people have.
For some, an understanding of how an aircraft works and what can happen during flight can help overcome fear based on uncertainty or uncontrollable.
Courier companies are well paid for their speedy delivery. Time is of the essence for working documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
Some routes had large companies with their own planes, but other routes and smaller firms had a problem.
If they had sent the goods by air, it might have taken several days for unloading and customs on some routes.
The only way to expedite this is to send it as checked baggage. The airline rules do not allow them to send baggage without passengers to their destination.
A common reason for flying first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better, to get paid by the company).
But it's not cheap: you'll probably pay  four times more for business and eleven times more for first class than your estimated economy-class fare!
In general, it makes no sense to look for discounts for business or first-class seats on flights that fly directly from A to B.
Airlines are aware that there is a group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for a quick and convenient way to get to a destination.
The capital of Moldova is  Chișinău. The local language is  Romanian, although Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in 1994 in eastern Moldova, which had its own government and currency but was not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a major transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, advanced, and vibrant commercial center, situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, but the city has a stronger Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, some of the tombs have interesting marble sculptures of doves.
The tour takes about half an hour.
To the north, within easy reach, is the romantic and wonderful city of Sintra, known to outsiders only after Lord Byron wrote a vivid account of its beauty.

Also visit the great temple of the Mother of God in Fatima, the world-famous site of the apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are, in effect, visiting a mass grave, a place that has an unspeakable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women still survive their time here, many of them relatives of those who were killed or Jews who worked here until their deaths, and many non-Jews.
Please treat this place with respect, solemnity and the respect it deserves, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disturb the space by placing signs on structures or by placing graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost all speak Spanish.
However, most of the inscriptions are in Catalan, which is the first official language established by law.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and elsewhere.
In the metro, announcements are usually made in Catalan, but in case of interruptions, the automated system announces in Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being egotistical, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is largely a misguided stereotype, the best way to live in Paris  is to behave like a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person, which will make life much easier.
If you show a little courtesy, the outward harshness of Parisians will disappear.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation, with dense forests of mainly beech, fir and pine trees.
Due to the diversity of its microclimate, soil, and altitude, it is characterized by a wide variety of plant communities.
The region is also home to a large number of animal and bird species.
The park is home to a variety of rare fauna, including the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, badger, heron, wildcat, and ocelot, as well as common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear a skirt that covers their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries give things to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially light-colored ones, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the door.
Men were also required to wear trousers that covered their knees.
This can also be purchased from the store near the door, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you will not feel comfortable in this skirt.
Like similar Mediterranean cuisines, the cuisine of Majorca is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), with olive oil used in all dishes.
A popular evening meal, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and cheese, tuna, and various spices available.
All nouns, along with Sie, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way of distinguishing some verbs and objects.
This may make writing a bit more difficult, perhaps because of the need to identify whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form, but it also makes reading easier.
Italian is relatively easy to pronounce, as most words are pronounced the way they are written.
The main letters that should be noted are c and g, as their pronunciation is dependent on the next vowel.
Also, remember that r and rr are pronounced differently: kar means dear, and karro means cart.
The grammar of Persian is relatively easy and generally well-developed.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn more about Persian grammar and better understand phrasal verbs.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
Only those who know a little Spanish may conclude that Portuguese is a close language and that there is no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete, and the museum is no more than a place of learning.
Since radiation exposure was not a problem in their heyday, they were usually located in cities or university towns and were more accessible than they are today.
Most modern research telescopes are large structures located in remote regions with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The spectacle of the flowering of the cherry  known as hanami  has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were chosen.
The first sakura performances in Japan were held for the emperor himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look most beautiful in their natural environment, so resist the urge to pick just a single grain of dead plants.
If you go to a formal garden and collect specimens, you will be expelled without warning.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, very convenient to travel, and you can buy everything you need when you arrive.
However, when you are in the high tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with heat (always) and hot sun (rarely when the sky is clear).
There are several buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Note that the bus you are about to board is not bound for the Jewish community of Kiryat Arba but for Hebron.

For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or going on a cruise to attractions on the Danube, or taking a boat ride along the Erie Canal.
They also designate routes for popular hiking and bicycle trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the customs associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-Christians in Christian lands and by non-Christians worldwide.
It is customary to hold a vigil in an open area on Easter night to watch for the rising of the sun.
There are, of course, Christian explanations for this tradition, but it may have been a spring and fertility rite in pre-Christian times.
Traditional churches hold vigils on Saturday nights during the Easter holiday, while communities begin the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came here by swimming, flying, or streaming.
The remoteness of the continent prevented mammals from travelling, and the giant butterfly was the only herding animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, such as goats, horses, cows, mice, cats, and dogs.
If you have visited the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will notice that the sun does not rise above the horizon during the polar night.
This is a rare opportunity to see the northern satellite, as the sky will be fairly dark around the clock.
You can gaze at the stars and see the light that is so bright that it is not long before the sun sets.
Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Costumes  are standard work clothes, and employees address each other by surname or position.
Harmony in the workplace is important, and emphasis is placed on group effort rather than individual accomplishments.
Employees must receive approval from their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions implicitly.
