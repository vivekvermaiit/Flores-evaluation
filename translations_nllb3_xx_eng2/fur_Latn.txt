Although it appears that an experimental vaccine may reduce Ebola mortality, it has not been conclusively shown that any drug can treat the already-initiated infection.
A mixture of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promise in this area, but formal studies showed it to have less of a desired death-prevention benefit.
In the PALM experiment, ZMapp acted as control, meaning that the scientists used it as a reference and compared it to the other three treatments.
The USA Gymnastics Association supports the letter from the USOC and accepts the total need on the part of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely held theory, but also offers details that fossils usually cannot, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists describe the plumage of this animal as being chestnut brown with a clear underside or with carotenoid pigments.
The study also offers information on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed root, called the tail, but had other features of feathers (such as scales and spines), researchers inferred that the tail probably developed later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather to regulate temperature or for display purposes; the researchers suggest that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than feathers from a bird.
The researchers suggested that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not avian plumage.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was seeking would have been caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, thus determining tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in much the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the halo-shaped galaxy and is made up of many smaller particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "both problematic and worrying because of its high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have picked up the germ in the hospital, and at least two of these were hospital health workers.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the overall number of people with TB still seems low: 6,000 out of the 330,000 total infected at any one time in South Africa.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves inside a voting booth and put a pre-printed ballot paper in an envelope marked with the candidate of their choice.
Once officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope inside the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
French electoral law codifies the procedure in a very specific way.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can be certain that there are no ballot boxes inside the polling stations and that no ballot boxes are added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to assist at any stage of the process.In the evenings, votes are tallied by volunteers under close supervision and following well-defined procedures.

The accused have been identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the machine rattled around it, none of them were hurt.
The driver, however, suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were evacuating the driver from his red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya is then found in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court, accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness evidence is likely to be falsified, as her photograph has been widely published.
This practice is common throughout the rest of the UK but the Scottish judicial system operates differently and so according to the court the publication of the photographs is potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line in publishing photographs and other material of the suspects".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the trials, told reporters that it would not comment further until at least an indictment had been made.
According to leaked reports, the document will address the border issue that Palestine wants to settle on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered were reported to be the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel asks for a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years from the time the deal is signed, while Palestine agrees to a five-year presence.
The shooters in the Integrated Pest Control Experiment were to be closely monitored by forest rangers, while the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Firearms Association of Australia (NSW Inc), qualified volunteers were selected as part of the Sporting Firearms Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director of conservation and parks at NPWS Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation were trained and received extensive training on safety standards.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the large anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, have been caused by the lack of elections, which, in part, have yet to be held as of 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunction due to overheating of iPods have been recorded, with a total of six catching fire causing four people to suffer minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company had described as "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling the delay in communication by Apple "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m. GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Mariana Islands said no dams were reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no tsunami indications.
A former Filipino policeman took a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly persons, had been released earlier, as had the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly nun who needed a toilet, and Mendoza was fired.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that administration of a hormone accelerated fetal lung maturation in the fetus.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two 'black boxes' with recorders on them on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died in a night two months old, something unique about her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Moon was as strange as I am...maybe even more so...I've wanted her all my life and I'll miss her...or at least hope she's out there somewhere better than this".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic were up 8 percent from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard withdrew from the 2010 federal election campaign, believing that Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four per cent of respondents shared the same opinion and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the poll's extremes, 29 per cent of respondents wanted Australia to become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 per cent wanted Australia to never become a republic.
He was to have swum the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was in doubt because of his disorder.
He was unable to take the pain medication he needed because it was forbidden by the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime in history.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software around the beginning of February, and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth as well as organic matter that could form proteins and thus support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, given that comets have been colliding with the Earth for a very long time.
Cuomo, 53, became governor at the turn of the year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He said that the voices were "taboo and political nonsense".
He is rumored to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will help airplanes fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport will be added and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and no car parks or interchange car parks are available there.
The fear of a lack of transportation has led to speculation that the match would be played behind closed doors without the club's fans.
A study published today in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
According to researchers at Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden, the species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, due to cross-breeding between a Darwin's fringe (endemic species), Geospiza forte, and a cactus fringe (migratory species), Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes and can also be rolled into smaller shapes.
It can be pulled by making it a string until it can be twisted and stretched. It can be beaten or pulled in pieces.
It can be extremely thin and can be applied to other metals, and was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn designs in books called "miniature manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH, and an indicator can be created by looking at the structure of the purple head.
The texture of the cap changes color depending on whether it is too acidic or basic (alkaline) which is the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (lH in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
The two dry powders are mixed together and then, with clean, wet hands, a ball is formed.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, giving a strange sensation and forming a kind of glare.
Nearly all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a water supply system connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewerage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes found in public baths, which were open to both men and women.
When calling someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space picks up the call and then reflects it back down almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket.Scientists use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket, over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, the greatest advantage the wheel has given us is that transportation has become much faster and easier.
It has been transported by train, car, and many other means of transport.
Below these are also midge cats that feed on prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are also many small felines (such as domestic cats) that eat many smaller and much more numerous prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, or a special job that each cat has and that therefore does not put them in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of the felines and live in large groups called packs.
In packs there are one to three related adult lions and up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
Females are usually closely related, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion cubs behave similarly to wolf or dog cubs, animals which bear a striking resemblance to lions in behaviour (but not to other large cats) and are deadly to prey.
A true athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not very well), swim, leap very high, and shoot with a force five times that of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not as full as that of the lion but is more like a roar, as when it is drinking.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, including apes, snakes, rodents, and even birds, although most of the animals they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find food animals (i.e. prey) through the air, emerging onto the ground where the animals are.
They can see very well in the dark due to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. Birds capture prey by blending in with their surroundings and then leaping around the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island from which it is difficult to return) they will find themselves in a different environment from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different arrivals, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become competitive with their previous needs.
The original population has not changed at all, still needing the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like the previous population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have evolved into such different forms that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which basically means the formation of a new species.Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a major part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e. waste products released by our breathing).
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis.They also provide shade.
Humans make their homes and gardens using plants.Most of humans' food is plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it was not feared by anyone, let alone other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw was covered with over seventy sharp teeth, as well as a set of teeth in the roof of its mouth, so there was no escape for what lay before it.
It is not known with certainty, but it may have had a two-pointed tongue, and its diet included shrimp, crawfish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also eaten anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex could not compete with it.
Although much of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual things to eat, such as cloves, peacocks, oysters, and a type of rodent called a glarus.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed socializing in distracted companies while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that would have arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no cabbage, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever harvested turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziqqurat, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was the god's special sanctuary.
In the cliche climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most Jewish family life was spent outdoors.
Women ate in the courtyard; stores were simply open stalls facing the street, and stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was colonized in a fragmentary fashion; Norse sagas relate that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that as he traveled further west, he came across Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each nation was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true; although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence are the words Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776. The text appears on the document's source, below.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parchment of the document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was made ready for destruction.
So it is possible that the notation was added merely to act as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were collaborating with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in an invasion code-named Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a sufficiently large group of people who live and work together in cooperation, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, relative to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town-state, and in some ways also defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizing culture involves the passing of knowledge across multiple generations, a cultural footprint that persists, and an equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any visible historical traces and fail to be recognized as de facto civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with the Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to tax, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
It had no authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Articles required unanimous consent by all the states before they could be amended, and states took the central government so far under their noses that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful football team in the world, after the German national football team, and was the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports include association football, handball, volleyball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and formula one motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's large number of islands, Japan is often called an  archipelago from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing through recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, meaning Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) armies seized control of western Taiwan and its northern coast, and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common still image photograph format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly the ratio has been inherited from the formats of digital image sensors.
The 35 mm format is somewhat inaccurate, being in effect 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio in integers) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) either match this ratio or are very close to it.
The widely used and often derided rule of thirds is a simple directive that creates dynamism by maintaining a measure of order in an image.
He determined that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had bound the states of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds should be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led to questions over whether this principle had been respected.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom imposed a naval embargo on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this embargo violated generally accepted international law and codified in many international agreements over the past two centuries.
The UK mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral shipping.
As this had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to prevent such situations from occurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each phase of China or ruling family was a characteristic dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most notable of which was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods, there were bitter wars between various nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in battle to gain access to the upper echelons of the Great Hall at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to any individual ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, the occupations were opened up to all male candidates allowing the most ambitious and skilled to succeed.
The same was true for the military, as military ranks were now based on ability rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other nations to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond this worldly life, and frequented a chamber known as Hira on the mountain of Noor (light) for meditation.
The shroud itself, which has survived to the present day, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the land is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if one knows it exists; once inside the landfill, it is completely isolated.
You see nothing but the beautiful clear sky above and all the mountains that surround it, and you see and hear very little of the world inside this land.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honour deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or Necropolis of Giza in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), many smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honour Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper  arc symbol looks like a V and the lower  arc symbol looks like a wedge or a square without a bottom.
Up means you start at the bridge and push the bow out, down means you start at the snout (which is where the hand should be holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward arc usually creates a softer sound, while a downward arc is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to mark your own signs with a pencil, but remember that the printed crossbow symbols are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The terrorized King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a hurry, surrounded by a mob that was shouting threats against the king and queen.
The queen ordered the king and queen to open the windows of the porch.
At one point, one of the guards cut off the head of one of the royal guards killed at Versailles in a gesture to the terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were required to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to support much of the cost, and the interest on the bonds was paid on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the large gains from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era when these events unfold is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a range of ideas, from the technological imperative or technological drive to a narrow sense that human destinies are determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path independent of cultural and political influences, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are congenital, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, the automobile can be said to have led to the development of the road by force.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for just a handful of cars, so new modes of production are developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
Mass motorization also leads to more accidents on the roads, which leads to the development of new medical techniques to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, as seen in writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture correlated with that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were superior to the arbitrary laws imposed.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of light began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as chairs and drugs that were valued above what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 11th and 14th centuries.
Early dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, styles in the West may have lagged behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, one of the major developments of the time being the introduction of buttons to tie clothes, as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce food sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often biological system that uses set seeds native to the ecological region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership by their distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the very rare cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their development.
Some of these children were kept in captivity (usually by their parents); in some cases, abandonment of the child resulted from parental rejection of the child for a severe physical or intellectual disability.
Surviving children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have survived in the wild on their own.
When fully grown from nonhuman animals, rescued children exhibit behaviors that are almost entirely similar (within physical limits) to those of the particular animal that cared for them, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a supporting aid for individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The stacking can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of stacking but can also be the little man behind the Microsoft Office.
Virtual shelves are embedded in software and are designed to ask questions, prompt, and explain procedures that may be too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are given up for a variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse and even extortion.
No child should choose to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and nurturing, but it does happen.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care is intended to provide for all the needs that are lacking in the home where the children are being raised.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet have led to a further dimension in terms of usage and reward theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal envy"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is telling lies by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", indicated that people who are unable to understand a speech due to a brain tumor can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and overt.
Mutation adds new genetic variation and selection removes it from the body of overt variation.
Segregation and recombination gradually erode the variation between the two with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet the demand for amino acids with available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so leads to severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins in the leaves and stems, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ant, termite, etc.) is not only easily digested, but provides a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not be surprising if our ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up later during a normal sleep period and returning to sleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a sufficiently quiet key that brings you into consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you are restoring the key in your dream, you can put it on the other side of the room, so that you are forced to come out of the jet to study it.
Other options based on the biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace a person has within him is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force is present. Each person has the potential to find total peace and happiness.
The only thing that prevents us from reaching the goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana way of loving and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
In kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity, with the visualization of a variety of deities cleansing energy channels, activating chakras, and creating enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States, and by the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the disintegration of these nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in great numbers, by proxy armies, on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope of their survival was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is a far more efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the job of the navy was to ensure that its nation maintained the ability to move men and goods, while simultaneously interfering with the enemy's ability to move men and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of the Second World War, in which the Americans attempted to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the United Kingdom.
At the same time the German Navy, using mostly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have succeeded in conquering the United Kingdom, as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated as far back as 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other areas of grazing, often tended by shepherds who were often children or young men, in a manner similar to the better-known sheep herders, and these methods of grazing are still used today.
Wagon trains were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted only of parallel wooden rails, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than those on the roads of the day.
Crossing was introduced early enough to hold the tracks in place; at the same time, it was realised that the tracks would be more efficient if they had iron rails on top.
This became common practice, but iron was more commonly used on wooden car wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron wheel was introduced.
The earliest known means of transport is walking, humans began walking about two million years ago as the offspring of Homo erectus (which means "upright man").
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright in the usual way.
Bipedal specialization is found in fossil Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 Ma, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
One can start to live more environmentally friendly lives, join environmental movements and even become an activist to help reduce future suffering.
This is intended as symptomatic treatment in many cases; however, if you do not want a temporary solution, then you should find the root of the problem and disable it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed dramatically due to humanity's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been compounded by humanity's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by Congressman John Hancock and Congressman Charles Thomson was sent some distance to John Dunlap's printing press.
The night after the sinking between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the Dunlap Flyers.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall at 8 am.
One was sent on August 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York City on August 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of that document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and they call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet, scaly legs, lay eggs, and hover on two sides like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently generic that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term pudendal is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is based on an old familiarity with the puddles, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the horned pupae and the jet flies are nesting insects, adapted to live in the nest or in the host's home.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, the natural parents terminate their parental rights so that another spouse can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which in effect guides most scientific research.
Not only is experimentation, however, and an experiment is any kind of test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, but also asking questions and making observations guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were widely accepted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior that are often critically dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that carry forward a period of cyclically free running even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the earliest suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments by either staining DNA in bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus or staining bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected were germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural villages by car to go to work, and they meet their work-bound counterparts in the same place they had just left.
In this dynamic transportation sphere, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private automobiles.
Current science indicates that this large-scale carbon economy has detached the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Similar levels of complaints about water quality or the quality of the water wells are rarely heard in developed nations.
Why do transportation systems generate these complaints, why do they do it every other day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual cars and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because autistic behavior cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, autistic people tend to behave within a fairly constant spectrum; thus, traffic flows tend to have some consistency and can be represented in a roughly mathematical way.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships support the planning, design, and management of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to be carried through the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are butterflies and aphids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus asserted that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't appear to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with points as large as six miles across.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it draws water from a thousand smaller streams.
Although stone construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or technical excellence of construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were thousands of years old.
With a population of about 800 people, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent nation and the least densely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used by most of the people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, zinc and copper since antiquity, since these can be found in nature in their native form and are easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was most similar to the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they can move into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are usually mixtures of two or more metals, not to mention the many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys may also include trace amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a thousand billion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
However, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lesser position and use.
Now people can type messages on computer screens, without ever having to reach for a pencil.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Much like pushing a heavy rock up a hill, splitting the nucleus once more releases some of that energy instantly.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they can be broken down with little or no disruption.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km (43 mi) thick at its nearest point and 100 km (62 mi) thick at its farthest point.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may have been more sea on the near side as the crust was thinner, making it easier for lava to rise towards the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what makes them happy.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want and what factors in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when supervisors begin to lead their peers from behind: On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain one of the guys (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change whatever the group is doing and do it themselves.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior often results in conflict between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are treated to the same level of excellence as conventional groups, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual group often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of the conventional group since their group can meet at different times that may not be understood by the local management.
The presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the management group to which each member reports, and sets the criteria for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to create a learning organization?One purpose for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments in an organization, creativity and innovation can be unleashed.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of clients.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines continuous delivery as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thereby narrowing the field and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and cancer affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This provides a wealth of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI forms a very important area of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligence processing in a machine.
Research in AI involves building machines to perform automated functions that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and queries, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things became separate disciplines, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are used extensively today in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been incorporated into many home computer and video game software applications.
Tours are an important part of any classroom, and often a teacher would be happy to take his students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can browse museum collections, visit an aquarium, or admire a work of art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol; each year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online for diary purposes.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills, and students typically begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to focus on improving his writing and avoiding criticism.
In addition, blogging encourages students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them. The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to online materials, students can define their own positions within the context of each other's writings as well as outline their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive bilingual capital and offers an assortment of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and the North is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered to be Canadian par excellence by outsiders.
Larger areas further north are mostly sparsely populated, and some are wilderness and nearly uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people, there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent nations, or associated with France, and are renowned as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it flourished in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope, Europe's gateway to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Females: It is recommended that any traveler who wishes to be married, regardless of actual marital status, should be married.
It also helps to have a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider harassment and it is not unusual to be followed, held, etc.
You have to be firm in rejecting people, and not afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinits as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese had destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt it as Daru I-Badya and the name Casablanca was given to it by the Spanish merchants who had established their commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as cutlery, pottery, Korean goods, water pipes and a lot of toys, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets, especially in the city centre.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be investigated to understand the situation of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for the climb of Nyiragongo volcano, alongside some of the most affordable mountain gorilla viewing routes in Africa.
The boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to travel to Goma, the normal (local) fare is about 500 CFA for a short distance.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a small town, though its reputation as a tourist attraction is well established, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand dunes.
She was one of the longest-serving hosts of the PBS special The Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the nation's cities, as it is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 (19,500 sq mi) and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each one supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered a jewel of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily fees for conservation and park admission.
It may be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either select parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the location of many of the tourist attractions in the city.
The parade of buildings that creates the profile of Hong Kong has been likened to a bar chart, the slope of which is made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront from the front.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists first settled, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest in Indian Territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps: they contain some of the last remaining tree-covered areas of the vast jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/land areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been declared a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 packs of brown bears in the area.
Buses leave from the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading East and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is best to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, it is 378 metres long and has two aisles that are 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 50 feet (15 m). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
The 16th century saw the birth of Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' encounters with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that would last three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
There are also smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is taxed at the same value as the British Pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
On the outer islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although they may accept British and American currencies; check with the owners first to determine which is an acceptable method of payment.
It is nearly impossible to change the Falklands' currency outside the islands, so change the currency before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the equator, it is east there, while in the northern hemisphere it is west and opposite.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be insidiously cold: temperatures rarely go below zero, but the combined cold and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular "plentiful" and "substantial" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, keep at least 100 yards (100 m) away from bears and wolves and 25 yards (25 m) away from all other wildlife!
No matter how many monsters they may look like, bison, wasps, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not observe proper distancing.These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep your area clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbour.
All but one of the ships were sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the overthrow of the Tupua chieftain Tamase Lealofi III.
There are many attractions, due to Auckland's two harbours, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour district) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
There are almost all sandy beaches that are safe to swim in, and most have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's headquarters are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods of Central Auckland.
These are family friendly, sometimes crowded, with a good variety of shops along the coastline.
The main local beer is the 'Number one', not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing, the other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel best.
Local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are fearful.
To Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign: a short black is 'express', the cappuccino comes full of cream (no whiff), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on the Belgian level.The apple cider vinegar is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and accidents on the reef are rare.
However, he listened to the advice of the authorities, obeyed all the papers and paid close attention to the safety notices.
Cube jellyfish occur near the mouths and estuaries of the October to April rivers north of 1770.
Although sharks do exist, they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are fearful of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their primary habitat being the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, with a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include boarding, airport transfer or even combined hotel and holiday packages.
They may also block the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests however must first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For large parties, most music festival attendees choose to stay at the venue, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you'll have to get there early to find a place to camp near the music.
Note that while the music on the main stage may have ended, there may be other sections of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause a rather horrible sound for those most affected.
Cruise ships in Saint Petersburg include time in the city, and passengers on the ship are exempt from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize time and money spent by their guests; windows and clocks are usually missing, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special deals on food, drinks and entertainment, to keep the guests entertained, and to keep them in the house.
Some establishments offer alcohol on the house's own, but being drunk impairs judgment, and every good player knows the importance of honesty.
Anyone who wishes to drive in high latitudes or above the world's mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as smoothly as on smooth asphalt.
Long winters can produce enough snow to block a road in a short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
Otherwise ice and snow conditions are normal in most countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the main activity for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to the overland journey to see the magnificent wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and conventional tools allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "hike in the woods", "hiking", or "walking") consists of a series of hikes, ranging from a few hours to several days.
The 2021 Summer Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the average ticket price around ¥7,000.
Removing wet clothing can help to wash them away. Many hotels have a washing machine and dressing table available for loan, even if not present in the room.
If a keychain is not available, or if you don't like to put up overlapping keys, then you can use a keychain, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the tissue (things that can cause it to tighten, or in extreme cases burn it).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters will vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, it is best to consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are unfamiliar to them in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in extreme cases can cause an allergic reaction, spread venom, or transmit infection.
The same infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually classified as parasites.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Direct travel to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are much lower than in the earlier and later sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and adherence to them is even more important than in other circumstances.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is stronger than in many other places along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are generally very good, and in Bavaria they are more plentiful and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are common, with sweets cooked in the desserts throughout the year, and cakes and pastries appearing throughout the summer.
Many German dairy products also include almonds, walnuts and other dried fruits, and the famous cake often goes well with strong coffee.
If you want some small but filling desserts, try what depending on the region is called berlinese, pfannkuchen or crofe.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "sweet" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to imply that the food originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Zawi cuisine, now readily available throughout the archipelago, presents a variety of dishes cooked simply, the predominant flavors that Zawi people prefer are baguettes, pear, sugar (especially Zawi coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic drugs.
The stirrups are the footrests for the horsemen that swing along the two sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can give rise to safety concerns because of the possibility of a rider's foot getting stuck in one of them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has one foot embedded in a stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a flat, rather tight heel and bottom.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly the English saddle, have safety bars to allow the steed to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a galloping rider.
Cochamó Valley: the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and slopes.
The peaks include breathtaking panoramic views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly charting new routes thanks to the infinite potential of its walls.
Winter sports such as downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve jumping from a height over snow-covered terrain on skis or in the breeze caught underfoot.
Skiing is the primary outdoor activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ski fans, planning their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers have been dated to as early as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first amateur skiing club in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called alpine skiing, ski touring or skiing excursion.
It is related to, but does not necessarily include, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which in high terrain requires stiffer backs and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions you may be able to cover longer distances than by walking, but only very rarely will you achieve the speed of a cross-country run without a heavy lift on the tread.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent nations, and under normal circumstances, travel to many different countries often involves applying for visas and having one's passport checked multiple times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a nation in this respect.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if one has a Schengen visa, one does not have to apply for a visa for each individual Schengen member nation separately, thus saving time, money and documents.
There is no universal definition of when industrial products are antiques; some tax agencies define antiques as objects over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variation, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products may be termed antiques even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many other professions.
Even in the traditional sense, however, not all Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but they did subsist on fishing, hunting, and other activities, keeping reindeer as pets rather than as domesticated animals.
Today, many Sámi people are employed in modern trade, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the warnings of governments other than your own, but their warning is intended for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are only a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The views presented are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Weather is the umbrella term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are several types of weather, which can vary depending on geography, topology, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be especially alert to any weather risks in their area as it could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a potentially war-zone country should receive professional training.
An internet search for 'Hotel environment courses' will likely yield the recipe of a local company.
A course will typically cover all the problems faced by those with a lot more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically be 2-5 days and will include role-playing, much first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in wilderness areas are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents with them on their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undeclared gender (X) or with renewed documents to correspond to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is also highly variable.
Security checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people should not expect to go through a CT scan with their privacy and dignity intact before surgery.
Rip currents are the backflow of waves crashing against the splash, often against coral or similar reefs.
Because of the underwater topology the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current can form in deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of attempting to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming to the river again is no more difficult than usual.
Try to land where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skills or if you've been injured, you may want to wait for rescue.
Tornado shock comes before culture shock (it is not a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had no difficulty adjusting to a new culture may find it very difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
When one returns home after living in the forest, he has adapted to the new culture and has lost some of the customs of the native culture.
When you first visit a forest, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
People may also not realize that they need to be patient and understanding even with travelers returning home.
The pyramid's light and sound spectacle is one of the highlights of the children's area.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark and the city before the show begins.
The noise of tourists and merchants is usually heard, and the story of sounds and lights is intended as a fairy tale.
The Sphinx acts as a scenario and tells a long story.
Scenes are shown on the various pyramids which are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and are the most heavily populated of the islands, with six active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the mainland, with the largest island, King George Island, home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the submerged remains of a still active volcano have developed into a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula then merge with the plateau and rise again to form the 225-mile (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, is home to the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif with Mount Vinson at 15,910 feet (4,892 m).
In more remote areas, not covered by the cellular network, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a cellular phone, as you must be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is typically used by ships, including despatch boats, as well as expeditions requiring data and voice connections in remote locations.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those looking to take a gap year after school is to travel and study.
This option is well-suited for those who have completed high school and want to take a gap year before going to university without compromising their education.
In many cases, spending a year of study abroad can actually improve one's chances of getting into a university when one returns to one's home country.
A tuition fee is usually required for admission to these programs of study.
Finland is a great destination for sailing.The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos off its coast.
In archipelagos and islands, a yacht is not necessarily required.
While the coastal archipelagoes and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but still quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises stop briefly in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
Thus, one can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and return to sleep in the ship at night.
If you only travel on cruise ship excursions, you do not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships display in the Berlin, Germany deployment area.As seen in the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of any age and background, especially if you have never been on an airplane before or have had a traumatic experience.
Nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears or aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what they learn during a flight can help overcome fear of the unknown and a lack of control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver goods quickly, and time is often of the essence when dealing with business documents, merchandise, or currency exchange for urgent repairs.
For some routes the larger companies had their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies this was a problem.
If they were shipping by air, it could take days for some routes to clear before the goods were unloaded and cleared through customs.
The only way to get there quickly was to ship it as a carry-on bag, since the rules of the shipping companies did not allow a carry-on bag to travel without a passenger, which was therefore necessary.
The obvious way to play first-class or business is to charge a hefty fee for the privilege (or, better yet, have your own company do it).
However, this choice will not be economical: as a general estimate, one can expect to pay four times as much for a business class ticket as a typical economy fare, and eleven times as much for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in trying to get back to first class or business class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and they make that payment.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău, and the official language is Romanian, though Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any country in the United Nations.
Economic ties were reestablished between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most widely practiced religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a highly efficient transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed commercial center, surrounded by a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, the steel-framed buildings and the modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century bazaar, and ancient mosques and churches, though the city has a Mediterranean European flavor rather than a Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has a church with an unusual octagonal shape.
In the sanctuary, there are interesting marble carvings of doves over some of the tombs.
It is worth finding half an hour to stroll through this fascinating country.
To the north and a short distance away is the romantic and picturesque town of Sintra, famous abroad for its vivid account of the splendor of Lord Byron's writings.
The Scotturb 403 bus frequently arrives in Sintra and also stops in Cabo da Roca.
Further north, one can visit the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous site for apparitions of the Virgin.
It is important to remember that you are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a place of incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
Many of the men and women who survived those times are still alive today, and many more have had loved ones killed or forced to work until they die, Jewish and non-Jewish alike.
Treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and never make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazism.
Never ruin the space with incisions or graffiti in the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish, with about half the population fluent in Catalan, most able to understand it, and virtually all able to speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
Ordinary announcements on the Metro are made in Catalan only, but unexpected interruptions are automatically communicated in a number of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egotistical, spiteful, and rude.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel comfortable in Paris is to behave in the best way possible, as a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person, and to get around the city will be much easier.
The Parisian's rustic appearance quickly fades if one shows them a hint of good grace.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with forests, mainly of beech, fir and pine and features a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a wide variety of plant communities, due to a range of microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European black bear, wolf, eagle, osprey, lynx, wildcat and cedar eagle are found there, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear a lapel covering around the lapel and shoulders.
Most monasteries provided a signal for women to arrive unprepared, but if you brought your own, especially if it was brightly coloured, the monks or nuns at the entrance would laugh.
In the same vein, men should also have skirts that cover their knees.
These are also available from the entrance stock but are not washed after each use, so it may be unpleasant to put them on. The men's size is unique!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of other similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, meat (mainly pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any other available ingredients such as cheese, tuna and so on.
All nouns, as well as the courtesy pronoun Sie, begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way of distinguishing certain verbs from objects.
Thus this makes reading easier, whereas writing is a bit more complicated, as one has to understand whether a verb or an adjective is being used in a substantiated form.
Italian pronunciation is fairly easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
Particular attention should be paid to the letters C and G, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows them.
One should also be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means c, whereas carro means c.
Persian has a fairly simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, this grammar book will help you to learn Persian grammar better and to understand sentences better.
Logically, if one knows a Neo-Latin language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with some knowledge of Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough and thus not worth studying independently.
Today, pre-modern astronomical observatories have been superseded by museums and educational facilities.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, these are often located in cities or on college campuses, thus more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large structures located in isolated areas with good atmospheric conditions.
The flowering of the cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where the flower of choice was the cypress.
In Japan, the first flowering of the emperors was celebrated by the emperor himself and other members of the aristocracy surrounding the imperial court.
Plants do best in their natural environment, so resist the urge to pick just one specimen.
When visiting formal gardens, specimens cannot be collected, leading to immediate removal without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe city, easy to get around, and where you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But since it is found in the high tropics a few degrees north of the equator, it must endure (common) exposure to the sun and (rarely on clear days) sunlight.
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
It is best to ensure that the bus you are taking goes all the way into Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good idea for organizing a vacation.
Examples might include visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a river cruise along the Danube through interesting cities or along the Erie Canal.
They also mark trails for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-Christians, in both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
The tradition is to spend the night of Easter naked somewhere in the open to watch the dawn.
There are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may have been a pre-Christian ritual dedicated to fertility and Virtue.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with the assemblies at midnight celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally reached the islands travelled there by swimming, hovering or flying.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, and giant land tortoises became the primary grazing animals of the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, sheep, goats, and dogs.
A visit to the Arctic or Antarctic in winter can be seen as a polar night, when the sun is not above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark above for most of the day.
Since the population of these regions is low and thus light pollution is not a problem, stars can be celebrated.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Western customs.
The fashion is the standard way to go to work, and colleagues are called by either surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental and teamwork is more important than individual results.
Often, workers must seek permission from their superiors before making a decision and must obey their superiors' directives without question.
