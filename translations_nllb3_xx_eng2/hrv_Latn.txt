This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a popular theory, but it allows for details that fossils don't usually give, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the upper part of the animal's feathers were a brownish-brown, and the lower part was pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed feather specimen called a rachis, but have other features of feathers - the I- and II-order spores - researchers concluded that the specimen likely evolved later than these other features.
The feather structure suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or pointing. The researchers say that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of the adult specimens, not the feathers of the young.
Research has shown that although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen is part of the feathers of the adult bird's colour, not the chick's paper.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was supposed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was aiming for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way pulls the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have proven that dark matter affects each other just like ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around galaxies forms a halo around the galaxy that is made up of many small particles.

The cave's temperature is not as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent because they are large openings in the ground, says Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally done without the use of high technology: Voters are isolated in booths, where a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the chosen candidate is put in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly regulated by the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that at the beginning of voting there are no envelopes in them and that no envelopes are added to them except those inserted by duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and in the evenings, volunteers under strict supervision count the votes following certain procedures.

Although three people were in the house when the car hit her, no one was hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services free the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Magistrates' Court on charges of murdering his son.
She's in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but there's a possibility that the eyewitness evidence will be derivative because many media outlets have published her photograph.
This is a well-established practice throughout the United Kingdom, but the judiciary in Scotland operates differently, and the courts have considered the publication of the photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are dancing on a dangerous wire for publishing photos etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which handles all criminal cases, has told reporters that it will not comment further until at least the indictment is filed.
The document will, according to leaked information, address the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continuous military presence for ten years after the signing of the treaty, and the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence lasting only five years.
The hunters in the trial hunt to suppress the nuisance would be under the strict supervision of park rangers who would monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the hunt.
The NPWS is a non-profit organisation that provides training and support to the sport of shooting in the state of New South Wales.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and park heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected to carry out the first firing operation received extensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth provisional election board in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission cited CEP's early resignation as part of a package of measures towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the absence of elections that were due to be held as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating causing six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
"Last week, the Department of Commerce and Industry said Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
"The State Department called Apple's delay in the report "really regrettable".
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has declared there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired a shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of hormones accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two flight data recorders from the "black box".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first queen of extreme, my first manager, and she died in the night two months ago, pretty unique, just like her, a strong woman.'"
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnells stated ""Luna was as strange as I am, if not more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place"."
From 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share the same view and believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to swim in the 100- and 200-meter freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but complaints have raised questions about his health.
He couldn't take painkillers because they're banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known up to January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water on Earth, along with organic matter that can make proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets form, especially the Earth, which was formed by a cometary collision long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year, and the governor signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
"He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
He's supposed to run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would allow aircraft to shorten flight paths, saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older radar-based technology, this system uses satellite technology to help air traffic controllers more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport options will be organised and overhead trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to fears of a lack of transportation, the possibility arose that the game would have to be moved indoors without fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reports the development of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species developed within just two generations, although it was believed that the process took much longer, due to crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza fortes, and the newcomer of the frog genus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be wound and spun, or it can be hammered in, or rolled into a plane.
"It can be very thin and stick to other metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "painted manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH, and your indicator might be red cabbage juice.
The salt changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH value is denoted by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the abbreviation pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together two dry powders, then with your clean wet hands squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tickle you and cause the formation of a cocoon.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, each house was equipped with at least one flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Baths were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and during Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled socially.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and space scientists use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and views.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, a huge rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel brought unimaginable changes to the world, and the biggest change was that the invention of the wheel made transportation much easier and faster.
It made possible the invention of the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special position occupied by a single cat, so that it does not have to compete with the others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called herds.
Lion packs consist of one to three related adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump a great distance, and pull with five times the strength of a man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar with its voice, but more like a series of incomprehensible, convoluted words.
Ocelots eat small animals, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smell, sniffing out where prey has moved on the ground.
They have very good night vision and they move very inconspicuously, and they hunt by blending in and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, when crossing a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
A new environment means different resources and different competition, so a new population needs characteristics or adaptations that are different from the old ones in order to compete for resources.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still have to make the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much in appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and then take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants create food from sunlight through photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaur was the top predator of its time so it was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaw had over 70 sharp teeth along with an extra set of teeth on its palate which meant it was no help to anyone who got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a loose tongue, and it ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would not have been able to keep up with it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unusual delicacies that included wild boar, peacocks, snails, and puffins.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate seated at tables, while the rich men enjoyed communal feasts at which they ate reclining on their sides.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained the ingredients that would come to Europe from the Americas or Asia over the next few centuries.
For example, they had never tasted corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the deity.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by the priests.
Sometimes, specific pyramids were shaped into towers, called ziggurats, that were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most Hebrew families lived outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; stores opened to the road; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited, and Norse sagas tell of how Erik the Red, after being banished from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way west and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes had already settled there.
"Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence it says, 'Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776.' The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down".
No one knows for sure who wrote this large parchment document (dimensions 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches), but it is known that soon after it was made it was wrapped for storage.
So, probably, that entry was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of "Vichy France", the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and moved on to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and it refers to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the size of a society in some way.
Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the imprint on culture and the equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and so we don't recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states by the Articles of Confederation first established a weak central government consisting of only the Congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no state or judicial authority, it relied on authorities that were often uncooperative to enforce all its acts.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and customs duties between states.
The treaty needed to be amended by the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were mostly absent.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after Germany, and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
"Because it is made up of a cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an 'archipelago' by geographers".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing along the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan and initiated the transformation of aboriginal practices in grain production and employed Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
1683 Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly takes control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declares Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better insight into how they were originally built.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still going on.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size before the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, the same ratio is used for the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
It's a little confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of the width to the height of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio expressed in prime integers) is therefore 3: 2.
Many common formats (for example, APS group formats) are equal to or closest to this image width-to-height ratio.
The oft-violated and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining some order in the picture.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under criticism.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European nations with different languages and customs.
The powerful power of Christianity affected everyone from kings to princes.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used for the purpose of alleviating suffering and reducing poverty, and that the church's funds exist for that specific reason.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they are following that principle.
Soon after the outbreak of armed conflict, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain had mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, endangering the ships of neutral parties.
Given that there was little interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the pacifist and secessionist attitudes of most citizens and peoples prevailed.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (a clerk at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each family in power was a distinctive dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there followed an unstable period of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died in the battle for supremacy in the great palace of Xian.
The consequences are social and political, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not the ruler.
Besides, after the Revolution, employment was open to all men and the most ambitious and successful were given the opportunity to succeed.
The same is true of the army, because after the revolution, ranks were based on ability, not merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond the confines of his dull life. "The cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) was visited to enable him to think better".
A cave that has survived through history provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all even if you know for sure it exists, because once you're in a cave, you're completely isolated.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Pyramid of Cheops, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Necropolis of Giza"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and a multitude of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Pharaoh Khufu's wives and members of his family.
"The 'upward movement' shall look like a V and the 'downward movement' like a staple or a square without a bottom".
The up sign means to start from the top and push the paddle, and the down sign means to start from the frog (where we hold the paddle with our hand) and pull the paddle.
A raised cymbal usually produces a softer sound, while a lowered cymbal is louder and more intrusive.
Feel free to add your own labels, but remember that the movement labels are printed for musical reasons, so they should usually be adhered to.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister Elizabeth were forced by a mob of women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the mob, in front of the horrified queen, shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war costs of American imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to offset much of the cost, and the interest on the bonds was exchanged through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos will form the core of the profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars we must understand the context in which the order was created.
The period of these events is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000  1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological incentive or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is guided by fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the invention of the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not enough to support just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership leads to more road accidents, which leads to the discovery of new techniques in health care to treat injuries.
In Romanticism there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, customs and cultures associated with geography emerge that are consistent with the physical residence of a society, and therefore are superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of luxury from 400 B.C.E. to about 1100 C.E.
The status deteriorated in the 12th century largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were of greater value than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
The dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great discoveries of the age as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons on clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds from an indigenous ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture special may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their membership in a recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite the unfortunate cases of children who grew up without adult socialization, either as a result of neglect, accident, or intentional abuse.
Some wild children are captured by humans (usually their own parents), and in some cases abandonment is the result of a parent's denial that their child has severe intellectual or psychological impairment.
Wild children may experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If fully raised by animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within bodily limits) that are almost completely similar to those of the animal that raised it, such as fear of humans or indifference to humans.
While learning on a project should make learning easier and more interesting, the installation of scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not an educational method but a support for individuals facing a new learning experience, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scales can be virtual and real; in other words, the teacher is the shape of the scale, as well as the animated clipboard that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software and is designed to test, instruct and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the learner to solve on their own.
Children are placed in the foster care system for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, nurturing, and educational, yet it does.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is mandated to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster home should meet all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
"For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are cited as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"In researching visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" as new motivational aspects".
The use of video has made important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, argues that people who cannot understand a speech because of brain injury can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He suggested that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century revealed that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection is a removal from a set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shift the variability between these two sources.
In the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to those of humans have difficulty meeting their need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In fact, failure has serious consequences: stunted growth, poor nutrition, and eventual death.
The most available plant resources were leaf and legume proteins, but these are hard for primates like us to digest uncooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also contain large amounts of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors "solved the 'protein intake' problem' in much the same way as chimpanzees do today in the savannah".
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and going back to sleep shortly after (10  60 minutes).
This is possible by the simple use of a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which makes you want to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it's expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it embraces Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is a practice of stimulating kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Divine yoga is at the heart of Tibetan meditation, and through the visualization of various deities, it cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and creates a consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S.A. After the war, differences in systems, practices and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be led by truly empowered armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell apart almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered Poland and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern Polish regions, thus violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ship is certainly the most efficient way for large numbers of people and large quantities of goods to cross the ocean.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously preventing the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain, as it had succeeded with the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Pitom goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed the hills and other pastures, and were tended by so-called goats, usually children or adolescents, a term for shepherds who tended the goats.
Horse-drawn carriage rails were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden wagon tracks consisted of only parallel planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to move faster and to pull more cargo than would have been possible on the rougher roads of the day.
The railings were put in place early enough to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails could be more efficient with iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the chariot.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wood, and the first all-iron railway was introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal walking occurs in Australopithecus about 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements and we can even be activists to somehow reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, it's like symptomatic treatment, but if we're not looking for a solution that's just temporary, we need to find the root of the problem and neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overcrowding and extravagant living.
After Congress passed the manuscript draft on July 4, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, it was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printer.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th, and the other arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 copies of Dunlap known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But many of the features of birds resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their legs, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary characters or bits in computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to make an immediate diagnosis.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look for the special first-aid instructions on the label that relate to this poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in the official sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the well-known bug, an insect that has adapted very well to parasitize humans.
Both the killer and the common houseworm depend on their hosts, in whose nests or living quarters they live.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Such couples may give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and this method is actually the guideline for most scientific research.
In addition to this method, experimentation, or experiments that represent tests to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and observing also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West severed ties with Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the body clock.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not just responses to external cyclic stimuli, have been discovered in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free cycles even if there are no external signs.
The experiment that Hershey and Chase performed was one of the leading proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that pointed to DNA in a flask of radioactive phosphorus or a protein flask of radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells of the germ line are affected.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the plant and animal world.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and drive to work, passing by people whose workplace is the one they just left.
In this dynamic transportation scenario, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has thrown the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed lands, there are few complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why are transportation systems the cause of so many complaints; why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something much bigger at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a relatively consistent way, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between three main characteristics are established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of the road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly allowed them to escape their predators more easily and more efficiently to find food and steam.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their bodies.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't bend their wings are the fairy horse and the water lily.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were convinced of the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable because we don't have a sense that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids were built until the fall of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the pyramids at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of the country's working people, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known since ancient times about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of one or a mixture of more than four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals, and don't forget that the periodic table contains a number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil thus became a close friend to a great number of people when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of modern writing, the pencil has lost its status and is used less and less.
People write messages on computer screens these days, so they don't even need a sharpener.
We can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The physics bomb works by taking energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and when you split the nucleus, you release some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner in the lunar seas, thicker in the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more dark areas because the crust is thinner, and the lava could have reached the surface more easily.
Content theories are focused on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturation and growth.
These theories consider what motivates some people to want what they want and what environmental factors motivate them to do or not do something.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge in the case of managers who start managing former colleagues: At one end of the spectrum are attempts to remain 'part of the team.'"
This type of leader encounters difficulties in making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, assigning authority and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done and do it his way.
The team leader is ultimately responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often creates a gap between the leader and the rest.
Virtual teams are supposed to adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often represent a touchpoint to the closest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
"The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
The 'invisible team' represents the management team to which each member is accountable.
Why would an organisation go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organisation again?
After the efficient use of all available resources in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come to the fore.
As a result, an organisation's process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method by which organizations can achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, making the field of study narrower and much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a bunch of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it constitutes a very important branch of information science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research of artificial intelligence involves the construction of machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in economics, medicine, construction, and the military because they are embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom, and often the teacher would be happy to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual excursions, where students can browse museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in class.
Virtual sharing of trips is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the page changes, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of memorial.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills, and when students start blogging, they often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually corrects them.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger begins to seek to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also 'forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them'.The need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires them to be imaginative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to take learning beyond the traditional school.
"The appropriate use of blogs ""can encourage students to think analytically and critically; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their own point of view in the context of others' writings and express their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming capital city and offers a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Just a little further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond.
All of these things make Ontario feel essentially Canadian to foreigners.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To compare the population, which surprises many, there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have ties with France and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, which took deep root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that women on the trip say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what could be considered harassment and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Resolutely reject men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (this is not okay regardless of cultural differences!).
Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and in the time of the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, the city was known as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as bags, pots, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but that is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Gomu was devastated by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be explored to understand the nature of the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
To get around Goma, a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) is available, and the normal (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu, because of its relative inaccessibility, is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands".
Although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and an airport, Timbuktu is today an impoverished city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the main places where Henry Louis Gates stopped during the filming of the PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is the exact opposite of other cities in the country because it has more of the Arab world than the African world.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern boundary.
The park's 6,500 square miles [19,500 sq km] are divided into 14 different ecological zones, each one home to a different species of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be the leading South African National Park (SANParks).
As in other South African national parks, daily conservation fees and admission fees are required.
One might also benefit from buying a wild card that allows entry into certain parks in South Africa or into all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is a major destination for many tourists.
The display of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is comparable to a glowing column chart, made even more conspicuous by the sea in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast, Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on the landlocked land along the northern coast.
This place was appropriated by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast all the way to Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges valley.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended that you buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most counties, they drive small Japanese Toyota Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as the towns of Paro (150 Nu.) and Punakha (200 Nu.).
The Oyapock River is spanned by a suspension bridge that connects the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 273 feet [83 m], and the tower is 1,292 feet [378 m] long and has two 12-foot [3.5 m] wide strips.
The freeway is 50 feet (15 m) high and was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be put into operation in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous community inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and the Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering fruit, and fishing.
After the Spanish conquerors encountered the indigenous people in the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", was born.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to retain its indigenous character and identity.
The Argentine national team and its players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas
Smaller tournaments and matches are held in other parts of the year.
For tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for half-time matches check the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currency may be accepted; inquire with the owner in advance about acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the northern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical belt; temperatures of +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the combination of wind and moisture creates a feeling of being colder than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particular 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall is generally the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to human visits, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management guidelines, keep a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wildlife!
No matter how obedient they may appear, bison, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, bear in mind that the scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu, and it has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval battle in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the independence struggle led by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city saw the assassination of Tupue supreme leader Tamasese Lealofi III.
With two harbours stretching across Auckland, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour neighborhood) are on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are sandy, safe for swimming, and many are sheltered by the Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent Mission Bay and St. Heliers districts of central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded with a wide array of shops lining the shore.
"The main one is the local beer 'Number One.' The beer is not complex, but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta.'
There are plenty of French wines you have to try, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia might be more to your liking.
The local tap water is safe to drink but if you're shy, bottled water is easy to find.
"The concept of 'straight white' coffee is foreign to Australians. Short black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of tops (no foam), and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate is on par with Belgium, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of the above causes are rare.
Still, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Sea wasps appear near beaches and estuaries north of the town of 1770 from October to April, sometimes in other months.
Sharks do exist, but they often attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodations in advance relieves the traveler of the burden of having a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, organized transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents needed to arrive at the destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be made to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants camp at the festival site, and most consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you'll have to get there early to take your seats.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with young children.
If you are travelling in the northern Baltic in winter, be careful when choosing a cabin because the passage through the ice creates a terrible noise that is more audible in certain cabins.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city.
Casinos usually try to maximize the amount of time and money that guests spend.
They usually offer special food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them in the building.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy roads and snow-covered roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on a clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short time to get you stuck in it.
The vehicle shall be equipped with a means of transporting the following:
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, but traffic is generally continuous throughout the year.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the best experience for many visitors.
In everyday usage, the term safari refers to a journey by land to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to the car, and good views are possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a 'bushem walk', 'mountain safari' or 'walking safari') consists of a walk lasting from a few hours to a few days".
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, the host of the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for the 2020 Games before they were postponed, you could find yourself in an awkward situation.
The rules for cancellations vary, but since the end of March most coronavirus cancellation rules have not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were due to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
You can dry wet clothes by ironing them, and many hotels will rent an ironing board and a clothes iron even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a straightener, or if you don't like to wear socks that are smooth, you can also use a hair dryer if it's available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it takes only a minute for the water to boil; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if in doubt, buy bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests that are not familiar to them in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, transmit poison, or cause infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not usually classified as pests.
The Commission also found that the exporting producers concerned had not provided any evidence that the measures were in line with the Union interest.
Travelers to high-tax countries can save a considerable amount of money, especially on the purchase of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most demanding driving conditions on the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be aware of the steep inclines, narrow passages, and sharp bends.
The prescribed speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and strict adherence to the limit is more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, cell service here is better than on many other sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania WIlds.
German bakery products are quite good and varied in Bavaria, as in the southern neighbours of the Austrians.
Fruit-based pastries are common, such as apples that are added to year-round treats and cherries and plums that are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and a cup of strong coffee often goes well with the popular cakes.
If you crave a small but hearty bite, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
"Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be either "dry" or "wet".
Yogurt is a common ingredient in curries in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is the most commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is the umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines across the country.
But when used without any further admixture, the term refers to foods that originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago, and consists of a series of simple spicy dishes dominated by Javanese favorites of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The steep supports for the rider's legs hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they also involve certain safety risks because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his leg is caught in the stirrup, the horse could pull him if he escapes.
First, most riders wear boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety pins that allow the belt of the steeple to be detached from the saddle if the rider pulls it back in a fall.
The Cochamó Valley is a major climbing destination in Chile, also known as South America's Yosemite due to the diversity of its large granite cliffs and rocks.
From the summits, breathtaking views are provided, and climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes amid the endless possibilities it offers.
Snowsports with downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve descending a snow slope using skis or snowboards attached to the legs.
"Skiing is an important travel activity, and many people known as 'ski lovers' plan their annual holidays around skiing at a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking and skiing: also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although it does not usually include them.
Think of a ski trail as a similar mountain trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover a little more distance than by walking, but you will very rarely reach the speed of a ski run without a heavy backpack on the paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of a number of independent countries.Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean applying for a visa and passing passport controls several times.
The Schengen area, however, in this respect functions as one country.

Reindeer farming is an important source of income for the Sami people, and the culture associated with trade is also important for many people in other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and reindeer were mainly used for towing.
Today, many Sámi are engaged in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi area of Sápmi.
