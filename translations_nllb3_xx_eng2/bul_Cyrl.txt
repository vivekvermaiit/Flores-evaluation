Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is now widely accepted, but it also gives details that fossils generally don't, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists believe that the animal's upper feathers were brownish-brown with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed handle called a rachis, but possess other features of feathers - branches and hooks - the researchers conclude that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for temperature regulation or parade. According to the researchers, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult specimen, not chicken feathers.
The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage, not the plumage of a juvenile.

The light and rotation used together determine the number of the Rossby star associated with the plasma stream.
The lower the number of Rosby, the more inactive the star is for magnetic reversal.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is arranged around the galaxy in the form of a halo and is composed of many small particles.

They're cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal state is not as stable as that of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the USGS and Northern Arizona University astrogeology team in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Traditionally, voting in France is low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a booth, indicate their chosen candidate on a pre-printed piece of paper and place it in an envelope.
Once the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, he or she will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict about the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are released other than those of duly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see every part of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident happened is temporarily closed so that emergency services can extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness testimony could be distorted because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts view the publication of the photographs as potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are treading a dangerous line if they are distributing photos and so on of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the criminal prosecution, has told reporters that until an indictment is filed, no further comment will be made.
According to leaked information, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine is seeking based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other subjects discussed are the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both sides, and the Jordan Valley issue.
After signing the agreement, Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agreed to implement such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was monitored and its efficacy evaluated.
The Australian Sport Shooting Association's hunting program has recruited qualified volunteers in partnership with NPWS and Sport Shooting Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of "Conservation and Heritage" at the National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelli was sworn in to the nine-member new provisional election board yesterday.
This is the fifth interim election board for Martelli in four years.
Last month, a commission to the president recommended the resignation of the previous electoral commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October was the commission.
Violent protests have sometimes been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods, and overheating has been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The Ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "a real regret".
Mariana was rocked by an earthquake at 07:19 am local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reports no damage to the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in the Pacific said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and adults, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm birth in his spare time.
His research shows that if you administer a hormone, it will accelerate the fetal development of the baby's lung.
Government investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Luna was also honored by fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremism. My first manager. Luna went away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. She was a strong woman".
"The moon is as strange as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and I'll miss her...hopefully she's in a better place", commented Dustin Goldust Runnels.
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to the idea of Australia becoming a republic have risen by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of those polled who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
After all, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and take part in three relay events at the British Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness is in doubt.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to manage the pain, as it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25th discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially Earth, after comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and determine the exact location of aircraft.
There is no additional transport and no overland trains will stop at Wembley, and there is no car park or parking facilities on site to allow the vehicle to be left behind.
Fears of a lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the game will have to be held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
The emergence of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador is reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, the middle ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any shape, it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled out as a thin wire that can be braided and twisted, then forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books known as illuminated manuscripts.
This is the pH of a chemical, and using the juice of red cabbage, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is, cabbage juice changes color.
The amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances and then shape them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and it will feel a little weird, and it will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had toilets with running water in almost every house, connected by an elaborate sewer system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, the remains of sewer systems have been found.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women in mixed company gathered together.
You use a satellite when you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in an incredible way, and the biggest thing that we have with the bicycle is a much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
And finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) feeding on far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat has, that keeps them from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called pride.
The herds consist of one to three adult males with blood ties, along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually close-knit, a large family of sisters and daughters.
The Pradas act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and equally deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, make huge leaps, and pull with the strength of five healthy humans.
The tiger is in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that roar.
The tiger's roar does not resemble the lion's roar, but it is more like the utterance of growling, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent, by hearing where they have been on the ground.
With their night vision, they see very well in the dark and move very quietly, the survivors hunt their prey by blending into the environment and pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that returning is difficult), it will often find itself in a different environment from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The native population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, most of our edible food is plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the supreme predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were sewn with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set at the top of its mouth, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a tongue split, that his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and that he may have even been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; it couldn't even be matched by a giant dinosaur like T. Rex.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had many strange or unusual delicacies, including boars, peacocks, snails, and a species of rodent called the sleeping giant.
The other difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate, sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together, lying on their sides while they ate.
It is not possible that ancient Roman dishes included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a prime temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life takes place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were shelves facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not extensively forested, so the wood was extremely expensive.
In the Norse sagas, it is said that Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and travelling west, discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But despite its discovery, by that time, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.
You might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you've seen the movie "National Treasure".
It's not a treasure map, although there's something written on the back of the document.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at first, after it was created, the large parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for preservation.
It is most likely that the notation was added as a label only.
With the D-Day landings and the ensuing battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
It's run by the French of Vichy, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies entered southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
Within just two weeks, American and French forces liberated southern France and moved on to Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large and significant group of people working and living together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the Latin civis, or citizen, and civitas, which is city, or city-state, and that somehow determines the size of society.
City-states were the precursors of nations. Culture in the context of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and natural diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence of their existence, and therefore fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, with Congress as the only component of the Confederation's constitution.
Congress had no power to tax, and since it had no national judicial or executive authority, it relied on government agencies, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
Nor does it have the power to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The clauses required the unanimous consent of all the states to be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, as a geographical concept, it is often called an archipelago
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes in local grain-producing customs and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the borders of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they came to be.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues today.
The most common format for still photography in the world, for example, is 35 mm. This was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, its image format is inherited from the sensor image formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of the sides of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest denominator of integers) is therefore 3:2.
Equal to or very close to this ratio are very common formats (e.g. APS group of formats).
The much abused and often derided rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the photo into a third vertically and horizontally (See example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, already rich and powerful, was under attack.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the nations of Europe together, despite their differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
A basic Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's money funds exist for that very reason.
The centralization of church authority in Rome continued for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Britain began a naval blockade of Germany soon after the outbreak of hostilities.
Although this blockade violated the accepted international law, codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries, the strategy proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain mines international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the attitude of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
Nations wanted to avoid a future war situation again after seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I.
In order to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poetry and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Butcheler (his manager at his previous job).
In ancient China, there was a unique way to show different periods of time; for each stage of history or for each ruling family, there was a separate dynasty.
Between each of the two dynasties, there was also a volatile time of divided provinces, the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace of Xi'an, thousands of people died.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to one ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the classes were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for the military, because instead of the division in the army being based on class, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in things beyond this worldly life, and to meditate he often visited the cave that became known as the Hira on Mount Nur (Light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, conveys a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists, because once you're inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
There's nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, you can see very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the late pharaoh.
In Egypt's Valley of the Dead, on the Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is dedicated to Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are dedicated to his wives and family members.
The upward sign looks like a V, and the downward sign looks like a wire rope or a bottomless square.
Up means you have to start from the top and push the bow, and down means you have to start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and then pull it out.
An upward bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow is louder and more confident.
Feel free to put your own markings, but remember that the printed arrow strokes are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women in the marketplace.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved to the terrified queen the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The Filipinos themselves have paid the military costs of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The colonial regime of the United States forced them to pay taxes to cover much of the cost and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
The superprofits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the meaning of Templarism, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The period during which the events occurred is commonly called the Late Middle Ages - the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000  1300 CE).
The true Middle Ages are preceded by the Early and followed by the Late, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice - from the technological impulse or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is governed by logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two common ideas are shared among most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself goes on a path that far exceeds cultural or political influence, or that technology itself affects inherent rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle inevitably leads to the development of roads.
A national road network, however, would not be economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership has also led to higher rates of road accidents, necessitating the invention of new health care techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a large element of cultural determinism, pioneered by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography shaped customs and culture, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its glory as an epicenter of luxury dates from about 400 BC and continues until about 1100 BC.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as spices and silk, which were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Early dress was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to button their clothes, which was one of the great developments of the time.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out to produce enough food for the sole needs of the farmer and his family.
Market agriculture is a simple, often organic system, often using preserved seeds from the same ecological area combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The signs that define a subculture as distinct may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a characteristic and symbolic use of style that includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used tools to illustrate the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, ill-treatment or intentional violence, were not socialized by adults during the period of the children's growth.
Some untamed children were kept locked up by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to the rejection of severe intellectual or physical disability of the child by the parents.
Wild children may have been severely abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical constraints) that almost entirely resembles that of the particular caretaker animal, as well as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scale building is not a method of training but rather an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing new training, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, like the little man with the clamps in Microsoft Office.
The software has built-in virtual skeletons that are designed to ask questions, recall and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it happens.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything that was missing in the home they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in the use of the gratification approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuous relationships' were also identified as new motivational aspects by Imay and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, in particular, that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his work "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks points out how despite the fact that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are able to perceive the sincere attitude.
He even suggests that similar abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its need for amino acids through available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are serious: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins from the leaves and seeds of the legume plant, but these are difficult for us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (termite, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, it shouldn't be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up at your usual bedtime and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself turning off the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive life force, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and our own stress and negativity are the only things that stand in the way of achieving that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it's continued by many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana way of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, visualizations and mantras.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga, and through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightenment of the mind is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and after the war, differences in system, process and culture led to conflict between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It continued for the next 40 years, and a real battle was fought through mercenary armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian beachhead and reconsider its organization.
These plans, however, were invalidated almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after capturing the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to transport huge numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The task of a navy is traditionally to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent and most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans were trying to move people and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably invaded Britain, like the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goats, usually children or young men, similar to the more widely known shepherd.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to reach greater speeds and to pull greater loads than the more uneven roads of the time.
Traverses were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be more effective with an iron band on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (or upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally conscious lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce some of the negative impacts in the future.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people.
After it was passed by Congress on the Fourth of July and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the handwritten copy was sent to John Dunlap's printing press, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made at night, now known as 'Dunlap broadsides'".
The document was first read publicly by John Nix in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops on July 9th in New York, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
Dunlap's 25 single-sided copies on large sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But for the birds that still look like dinosaurs, there's a lot of stuff.
They have feet with claws and scales, they walk on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and they lay eggs.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning doesn't always manifest immediately, but symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis can be made immediately.
The presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term beetle is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from a long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the flying beetles and the common beetles are colorless, living in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents end, after which the other couple can be the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, and in fact, the scientific method guides most scientific research.
It's not just experimentation, although to eliminate some of the possible hypotheses, experiments are used, asking questions and using guides also go along with scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, and in particular with the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to perform a free-range cycle even if there are no external signals.
One of the leading hypotheses that DNA is genetic material was the experiment done by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they tagged either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a wide range of effects.
Only mutations in cells in the germ line can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is attractive to people with an interest in visiting natural areas in order to admire the landscape, including wild plant and animal species.
Activities that can be done here include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as learning about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.
Every morning, to get to work, people travel from small country towns by car, and they pass others whose work destination is the place the first ones just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is to some extent connected to and maintains a transportation system through private cars.
That this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years is now being shown by science.
Every person is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely so many complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down on a daily basis, are transportation engineers just incompetent, or is something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Since the behaviour of drivers unfortunately cannot be predicted with 100% certainty, studying the traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; so traffic flows have some logical sequence and can be represented approximately mathematically.
For a better representation of the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics are defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links help in the planning, design and ultimately operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back over their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and the dayflies are the only insects that can't fold their wings today.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many hold the opposite view - that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying over eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at 6 miles wide in places.
The Amazon provides as much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the rush of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza remained unsurpassed in size and technical superiority of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the least populated and smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.
All the subjects of the Vatican are Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in natural form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Metals are considered to be elements like calcium and potassium, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter, and matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So when it first came out, the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was reduced to a lower status and use.
People these days write messages on computer screens and don't have to touch pencil sharpeners.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The plutonium bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they tend to break up with little or no thrust.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more sea on the near side, because the crust is thinner there, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness are focused on finding out what makes people respond or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's "hierarchy of needs" and Herzberg's "two-factor theory of motivation" are the two popular theories of content.
Generally speaking, once managers start managing their former colleagues, it's possible that two behaviors emerge: on the one hand, there are those who try to remain "I'm one of our guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty enforcing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and seeking accountability from people.
You become, at the other end of the spectrum, an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Such behavior often causes a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the virtual team often function as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.This team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, the organisation's work process to overcome an obstacle may lead to a new innovative process in service of the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, its managers must create a culture of innovation, as well as organisational training and knowledge sharing.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that is used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
The physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition is provided by the neurobiological data, which narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a great deal of significance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch in computer science dealing with the learning, behavior, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines that perform automatically tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Some examples that can be listed are control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Problems like this have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system, which is embedded in several home computer and video game software applications, is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Excursions are a big part of school education, and very often a teacher would like to take his students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a web page for their trip to the state capitol, and every year, that web page is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a sketchbook.
While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes that fact.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author, to avoid criticism, has started to strive to improve his writing.
Also, blogging 'forces students to be more familiar with the world around them' and the need to nurture the interest of the audience inspires students to be interesting and smart (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, students can be enabled to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material in the context of other people's writings, students can define their own positions, and also outline their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming and bilingual capital, home to a number of art galleries and museums where you can see Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of Muskoka and surrounding lands.
All of these things cement Ontario as a model of what is typically Canadian to foreigners.
The large areas to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited deserts.
One population comparison that surprised many: the number of African-Americans in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and is a separate continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands and it had a great influence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the "Bridge of Good Hope", the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south.
Women: It is recommended that any traveling woman declare that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to situations that they consider harassment, in which they are often followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el-Beyda, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established their trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as far east as Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets and especially the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma must be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a "bodo-bodo" (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Timbuktu, coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has gained use as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though it has become a tourist attraction because of its reputation and its airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS show of Henry Louis Gates "Special Wonders of the African World".
The city is strikingly different from the rest of the country because it has an Arab look rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and extends eastward along the border with Mozambique, northward to Zimbabwe, and the Crocodile River is its southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km2, divided into 14 separate ecoregions, each with a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Generally all South African national parks require daily fees for park entrance and conservation.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists feel is worth visiting.
The row of buildings that line Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glittering pillar-like diagram that protrudes from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast of Kowloon.
Most of the developed part of Hong Kong Island is densely located on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonialists appropriated, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, you might as well start here.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) off the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and this part of the forest, which is on Indian territory, is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, almost one-third of which is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (behind the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumtang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of travelling short distances, such as to Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 273 feet (83 m), the length is 1,900 feet (378 m), with two sails of 12 feet (3.5 m) width.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be put into operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous tribe inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who have survived by hunting, gathering fruit, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Giant Province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its distinctive character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and individual polo players in the world.
The biggest annual tournament is held in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
Check out Asociacion Argentina de Polo for news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP) with a value equal to one British Pound (GBP).
The money can only be exchanged at a bank located in Stanley against the FIC West store, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and US dollars are also often accepted within the Stanley credit cards.
In the outer islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but British and American currency may be used; speak to the hosts in advance to find out which payment method is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months normal temperatures are above +30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, be at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how obedient they appear, buffalo, deer, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can strike.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so don't go into their private space.
In addition, be aware that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking scented food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia, the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1850s.
The harbour was the site of a scandalous naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Ma'u movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the city ended with the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamase'e Lealofi III.
Because Oakland is bordered by two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor area) beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all are guarded sandy beaches for swimming, and most have shade under the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located by the port of Waitemata, on the outskirts of the expensive Mission Bay and St Heliers areas of Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a heavy beer, but is pleasant and refreshing. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There are plenty of French wines to sample, but New Zealand and Australian might do better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
The idea of "flat white coffee" is foreign to Australians, with the black coffee being espresso, the cappuccino being topped with cream (not foam), and the tea being served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many of the walks to the reef are year-round, and reef accidents caused by any of these reasons are rare.
However, please heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the town of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their primary habitat is along the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although you may find other accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast included, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined airplane and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you'll have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may be over, there may be festival stages where it will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as for the most affected, crossing the ice makes a rather terrible noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city.
Usually casinos make a great effort for guests to spend maximum time and money.
To keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them in the room, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drinking affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like you would on clear asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to cause you to get stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow or hail, and by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, frost and snowfall are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is almost continuous throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and is the final destination for many visitors.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to a journey by land to explore the amazing African wildlife, specifically the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars and get a good view with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and are best observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "wildlife walk", "tourist safari", or "walking walk") is a walk of several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the 1964 Games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the regular ones costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them out, and many hotels have a cast iron and ironing board that can be used even if there is no iron in the room.
If you don't have a cast or don't want to wear cold socks, you can try using a tumble dryer if one is available.
Do not allow the tissue to become too hot (which may cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burning).
Water can be purified in a variety of ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're worried, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to them in their native places.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals in themselves that can forcefully injure or kill humans are not normally classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated outlying areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous or following sections, where they are usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is more important than elsewhere.
Curiously, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are exceptionally good, and Bavarian pastries are quite sumptuous and varied, similar to those made in their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples being put in cakes year-round, and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts, and popular cakes often go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small, though rich, pastries, try those that, depending on the region, are called berliner, pfankuchen, or krapfen.
Curry is a dish of meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan curry is often made with yogurt; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
But when used without further definition, the term usually refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays widespread in the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes many plainly seasoned dishes, and the predominant flavours that Javanese prefer are hot peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The arches are supports for the rider's feet, hanging from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but safety concerns may arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
In the event of a rider being thrown off a horse and his foot getting caught in the stirrup, he will be dragged if the horse escapes.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a thong and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow the skin of the stallion to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley - the best climbing destination in Chile, known as South America's Yosemite, with an abundance of large granite walls and canaries.
The feats include breathtaking views from the summits, and climbers from all over the world are constantly building new routes amid the walls' endless potential.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending a snow-covered terrain with a ski or snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, better known as "ski booms", planning entire ski-related vacations in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first sporting ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski tourism.
They are similar but do not typically include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter taking place on steep terrain and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a kind of tourist trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover slightly more distances than if you were walking  but you will very rarely reach the speed of a cross-country skier without a heavy backpack on supported tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent states.Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
While in the territory of this zone, you can generally cross the borders without going through the passport control points again.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen Member States, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques, some tax agencies define antiques as items over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be considered antiques, although they are not as old as antique mass-produced goods.
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding reindeer farming is also important for many other crafts.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have subsisted on fishing, hunting and the like, with the deer being predominantly draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern occupations, and tourism is a lucrative industry in Sampi, one of the areas where the Sami people live.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romanians, the word gypsy is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate notions of the Romanian people.

You may want to consult with other governments, but the advice of those governments is for their citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The meetings are nothing more than a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather event that can cause damage, serious social problems or loss of human life.
Anywhere in the world, severe weather can occur, and its manifestations are very different and can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather conditions include blizzards, snow, ice and sandstorms.
Travellers need to take into account any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as these can affect any travel plans.
Any person planning to visit a country that may be designated as a war zone should receive professional training.
The address of a local company will probably be provided when searching the internet for a 'hostile environment course'.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, but in much more detail and usually combined with practice.
The course is usually 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid activities and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Passengers planning a sex change operation abroad should make sure they have valid documents for return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports to persons of undetermined gender (X) or to update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to abide by these documents is also a variable.

Transgender people who are about to have surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Dead currents are the returning flow of waves that break off the shore, often at a reef or something.
The backflow, because of the underwater topology, is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and there can be a rapid current to the deep water.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which is probably impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming backwards is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere where you won't be caught again, or you may want to wait for rescue, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
The return shock occurs more quickly than the culture shock (there is a shorter phase of the honeymoon), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had a relatively easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their own.
When you come home after living abroad, where you've adapted to a new culture, you lose some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first moved abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that newcomers had to adjust.
People may not expect that returning travelers also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
You usually always hear the sounds of the tourists and the vendors, and the story of light and sound is like a storybook.
The sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator to a long story.
The scenes are represented on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, with King George Island and the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas as the largest islands.
Others include Livingston Island and Izmata, where there is a spectacular natural harbor due to the flooded caldera of a still active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then rise again to form the 200-mile chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, or Sentinel Range, is Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson reaching 4,892 m (16,030 ft).
In remote places with no cell phone coverage, your only option may be a satellite phone.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be out in the open and in direct view of the satellite to be able to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that require remote and voice data.
More information on how to contact this service can be obtained from your local telephone service provider.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to skip a year is to travel and study.
It's especially popular among high school seniors, which gives them a year off before college without compromising on their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad in the previous year would improve your chances of enrolling in higher education in your home country.
There is usually a 'training' fee to enrol in these education programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boating. 'The land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't have to have a yacht in the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually big enough for yachts, the smaller boats and kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where one boat falls for every seven or eight people.
The number is the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is 1 to 40).
Most prestigious Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for two full days, returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you go ashore using excursions organised by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Berlin, Germany is featured in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and the cruise price does not include a visit to the city.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have experienced a traumatic event or have never flown before.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different than the personal fears and hatreds of other things that a very large number of people have.
For some people, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly, and often time is of the essence for business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes, and for the smaller companies, that was a problem.
If they sent things by air, on some routes, unloading and going through customs can take days.
The only way to make it go faster was to send it as checked baggage, which is against airline regulations, which is your case.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a fat wad of money for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
This, however, is not cheap: in principle you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and eleven times more for first class!
In general, it doesn't even make sense to look for business or first-class discounts on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a significantly higher price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and to be charged accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic, plagued by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the secession of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldavian Republic, which, although having its own government and currency, is not recognised by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
With a population of about 3.7 million people, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Surrounded by a huge bay and surrounded by mountains, the once ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, thriving and bustling commercial center.
Broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres alternate with traditional red roofs, an 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere in the city is closer to Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey.

The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are in Catalan only, since it is the first official language by law.
At the same time, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
In the metro, regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but the automated system announces unplanned interruptions in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

The ragged appearance of the Parisians will quickly evaporate if you show a little courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is a dense forest of mostly beech, spruce and fir with mixed alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diversity of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes, there is an extremely wide diversity of plant communities.
The area also shelters a great variety of animals and birds.
Rare species of fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and deaf-mute, can be seen there, along with many other common species
During their visit to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts below the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries provide gowns for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same logic, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
Clothes can be borrowed from the supply at the entrance, but they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
As in similar areas in the Mediterranean, the Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available product such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" - "You", are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important rule for distinguishing certain verbs from objects.
It is supposed to facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to understand whether the verb or the adjective is used in a substantive form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the next vowel.
Also make sure you pronounce the R and RR differently: caro means dear while carro means chariot.
Persian is a simple language with a relatively correct grammar.
So this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Of course, if you know any Romance languages, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is a sufficiently close language that they do not need to learn it separately.
These observatories before modern ones are usually obsolete and are now used as museums or educational facilities.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem even in its heyday as it is today, they're usually located in cities or on campuses, and they're more accessible than those built today.
Most modern survey telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms are the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the Imperial court.
Plants look best when they're in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to tear off even just one.

Singapore is generally a very safe place, very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But in the "deep tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (constantly) and intense sunshine (seldom when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses north to Hebron, where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are traditionally buried.
Check that the bus you're thinking of taking goes to Hebron, not just the nearby Jewish village of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good base for a vacation theme.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire or Rhine valleys, or cruising to interesting towns on the Danube, or taking a boat trip on the Erie Canal.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians worldwide.
It's a tradition to spend Easter night awake in the open to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it's also possible that it represents a pre-Christian spring fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with the congregation often starting a boisterous celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on the islands originally came here by swimming, flying or sailing.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to cross the road, making the giant tortoise the first herbivore of the Galapagos.
After the arrival of the Galapagos people, many mammals were brought to the Galapagos, such as goats, cows, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and therefore low pollution is often not a problem, you too will be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
The suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or rank.
Harmony in the workplace is of paramount importance, with an emphasis on group efforts rather than the promotion of individual achievement.
Often, employees must obtain the approval of their superiors for every decision they make, and they are expected to follow their instructions without complaint.
