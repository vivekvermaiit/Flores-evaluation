When a group of seven creatures (a population of eight) migrate from their original original original population (such as the penguin or the crow, or the polar bear or the blue whale because they are so big and so small), they will have a different ancestor from the Slinky.
These new slings have different mother sources and different feeding habits, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to the new species that the mother tiger needs.
