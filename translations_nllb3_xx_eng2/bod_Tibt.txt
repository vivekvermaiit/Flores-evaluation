When a small number of species (a small number of individuals) are separated from their original population (especially if they cannot cross a mountain, a river, or migrate to a new island and return), they always find a way to survive in a new environment that they have never lived in before.
This new environment will have different resources for different species, different competitors, and so the new population will have to be more competitive than it already is, because it will have different characteristics or abilities.
The population has not changed at all, and they need to be able to interact in the same way as they used to.
