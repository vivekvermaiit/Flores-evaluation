USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's note and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We concur with the USOC's statement that the interests of the athletes, the clubs and their sports, can be served more appropriately by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than with the removal of the certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse of proportion that Larry Nassa's survivors so courageously described could have gone unseen for so long and accepts any necessary and appropriate change.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and the USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive, and empowered environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy in an advisory capacity and later for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
He advised Carter on foreign policy in the 1976 election. Subsequently, he worked as National Security Advisor (NSA) between 1977 and 1981, after Henry Kissinger.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, an already widespread theory, it also offers specific data that fossils usually do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, the animal has brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotenoid hue on the lower part.
The discovery also provides a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage lacks a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but does exhibit other feather traits (piggy and barbels), the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but that they were used to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of it. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the analyzed sample has features of the feathers of an adult and not a chick.
The experts' assessment was that, even though the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrates the plumage of an adult rather than a chick.

He warns that no one can give guarantees that any Iraqi action at this point will stop sectarian strife, rising violence or a drift towards chaos.
The report begins with a call for open debate and for consensus building in the United States about policies on the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of virtually every aspect of the current policy of the executive branch in Iraq, and calls for an immediate change of direction.
It contains 78 recommendations, of which the number one is the adoption of a new initiative before the end of the year with the aim of protecting Iraq's borders from hostile operations and to restore diplomatic ties with its neighbours.
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who currently holds the position of senator and is the first lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will run for the presidency.
The Teatro Argentino was the place where Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president; this is the same place where she started her campaign for the senate in 2005, representing the province of Buenos Aires.
The issue that gave rise to the debate was the controversy surrounding the budget for post-Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction, a measure that some fiscal conservatives jokingly labeled as the "Bush New Orleans Agreement".

Although it was a purely theoretical work, the program was written with the aim of simulating observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes tides.
Experts concluded that dark matter affects each other just as regular matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

Extremely resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African area of Zululand.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant was generating much concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate.
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were health care workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he has been in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total TB patient population still appears to be low: 6000 out of a total of 333 000 individuals infected at any one time in South Africa.

Authorities have also secured several million vials of the vaccine to fight encephalitis, which will allow healthcare companies to prepare for next year.
This year, a lack of monetary resources and low prioritization compared to other diseases have caused delays in the implementation of vaccine delivery plans in the historically most vulnerable regions.

During the day, its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding surface, and at night, it is higher.
"While their thermal behavior is not as regular as the large caves on our planet, which tend to maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep cavities in the ground", said Glen Cushing, of the archaeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cubicle and put a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets out the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to check that there are no envelopes at the start of the ballot and that no envelopes are added other than those of those who vote, duly computed and authorised.
Candidates are allowed to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process, and overnight volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, aged 25 and 21 respectively, were killed, the latter driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstructive surgery.
Uka's gun jammed while aiming at a fifth man's head. Schneider suffers from chronic pain, is blind in one eye, missing part of his skull, and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via a virtual link from a United States Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races in the championship apart from the competition on Wednesday.
The first was the slalom, in which he earned a "No Finished the First Race", as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she took tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind top finisher Claudia Loesch of Austria and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the seated category failed to complete their runs and a total of 45 participants from 117 in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, stated: We have placed under arrest five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the home at the time of the car's impact, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were removing the driver of the red Audi TT from the road.
He was initially transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh County Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, any eyewitness testimony may be questionable, as her image has been widely circulated.
It is common practice in other parts of the UK, but because Scottish justice works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "Journalists seem to be walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the proceedings, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the auto of the proceedings is dictated.
According to leaked information, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the boundaries in force before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics also discussed, it was reported, included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control trial, the rangers had to closely monitor the shooters as the shooters were monitored and their effectiveness was assessed.
In a joint venture between NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., eligible volunteers were recruited within the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage office, noted that comprehensive safety and training was provided to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
In four years, this is Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at steering the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's way of responding to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The sometimes violent demonstrations were triggered by the fact that elections have not been held, in some cases since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPods with malfunction and overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company categorized as "not serious".
The ministry spoke out about the delay in Apple's report, saying it was "truly regrettable".
Mariana was rocked by an earthquake at 7:19 am local time (21:19 am GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Marianas indicated that there was no record of damage in the national territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported no tsunami indicators.
In the Philippine capital of Manila, a former police officer hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 on the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it's been confirmed that at least six have died.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
She trained in obstetrics and entered work for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland around 1959.
Liggins began his research on preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators managed to recover flight recorders from the black box on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Moon was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Gold in Dust Runnels stated, "Moon was as weird as I am; even, more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she's in a better place".
Since 2008, there has been an 8% increase in the 1,400 respondents to the 2010 federal election who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting Prime Minister, argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once Queen Elizabeth II's term ended.
34% of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last queen to rule Australia.
At one end of the poll is 29 percent of people who think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other, 31 percent who think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question following his complaints.
He has not been able to take pain medication, because it is forbidden to use it in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known.
Many people tested the find using various types of hardware and software and in early February and it was released on Tuesday.
Comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets - especially our own - originate, since comets crashed into the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the start of the year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He called the rumours "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims would reduce the distance of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It employs satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be implemented and trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to concern over the possible lack of transportation, the possibility of the game being held behind closed doors, without the team's fans, was considered.
On Thursday, Science magazine released research that reported the appearance of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have revealed that the new species managed to evolve in just two generations, although it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on all kinds of shapes and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it to a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be made very thin and adhere to another metal, so thin that it was used to decorate hand-made illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance.
The colour of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the test chemical determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron, so a hydrogen ion is the result of a proton being stripped of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with hygienic and moist hands, squeeze them into a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in your hands and the outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems have been found.
Public baths were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets, and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space, because the light from Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision that we have.
A giant rocket, over 100 feet high, is needed to be able to carry a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, but the most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster form of transportation.
Thanks to it, we now have many means of transportation, such as the railway or the automobile, among many others.
Below are more moderately sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (which include independent domestic cats) that feed on smaller species that exist in much larger numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called packs.
Herds consist of one to three adult males of the same family group, joined by up to thirty females and their offspring.
Usually, the females are closely related to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions herds behave much like wolves or dogs, with whom they bear a striking resemblance (unlike other big cats) both in their behaviour and in their being highly lethal to their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, leap far, and pull five times as hard as a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four felines capable of roaring.
The tiger's is not a full-sounding roar like that of the lion, but, rather, like a sentence of words spoken to growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures, and when possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, almost all of which are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smell, sniffing the ground where they have passed.
They have excellent night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by mimicking their environment and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they came (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment from what they used to be used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations from those it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still needs the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the budding population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to classify them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and it is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (release).
Plants produce food from the sun's energy by means of photosynthesis, and they provide us with shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we also make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing but others of its own kind.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth embedded in them, plus an additional set in the palate, meaning that whatever passed in front of it, it had no escape.
We're not sure, but he could have had viperine, his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he could even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water - not even a dinosaur as huge as the T. Rex was a threat to it.
While most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent, the lyreon.
Another difference was that the humble people and women ate sitting on a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and leaning aside while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no Roman of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to meet the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the midst of the warm Middle Eastern climate, the house was of no great importance.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just counters facing the street; houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests; hence, timber was extremely expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland, and according to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey further west, discovered the island and gave it his name.
However, despite its discovery, the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
While each country was individually 'Scandinavian', there were marked differences in people, monarchs, customs and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the back of the document contains some writing, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" written on its back. The text is at the bottom of the document, face down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that as soon as it was made, the huge parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Therefore, it is likely that the footnote was added as a label only.
While the D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, the southern side was still to be liberated.
Its government was in the hands of the Vichy French, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the so-called Operation Dragon was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which a large group of people living and working together form part; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related both to the word civis, from the same language, meaning citizen, and to civitas, meaning city or city state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of society.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization involves a prolonged generation-to-generation transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations proper.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since it had a national executive or judicial branch, the function of setting taxes fell to state authorities, who often failed to cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
Nor was he empowered to override tax laws or interstate tariffs.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the national team of Germany, is the second team with the most wins in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most widely practiced sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice-joking, roller-skating, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago, from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing through the area recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island".
The establishment in 1624 by the Dutch East India Company of a base in southwestern Taiwan initiated a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, employing Chinese labor to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) army took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government acceded to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control of the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can visualize how they originally looked.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the work continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format globally is 35 mm, which was the most commonly used film size towards the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its dimensional relationship has moved into the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, the dimensional ratio of this format (divided by twelve in order to calculate the simplest integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbigracia, the APS group of formats) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been constantly mocked and often ridiculed, is a simple rule that generates dynamism while allowing a certain order to the images.
It indicates that the most effective position for placing the central object is the intersection formed between the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic church, which had amassed wealth and power, was challenged.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the monarch to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty, and that church funds are set aside for that specific function.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for over a millennium, and this concentration of power and money caused many to wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the disruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, the move violated widely recognized international law and was enshrined in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in entire sections of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany expected to encounter a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920's, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to prevent a repeat of that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States in order to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different time periods, each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Hhan and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
Its political and social consequences are many, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, since, instead of basing army ranks on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people from the repressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as Hira on the mountain of Noor (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured through time, illustrates very realistically Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave completely abstracted from the rest of the planet.
It is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence, because inside the cave, the isolation is total.
From inside this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of many pyramid-shaped and large structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other such smaller tombs and temples were erected in honor of his wives and relatives.
The arc upward mark resembles a V and the arc downward mark is similar to a staple or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while a downward movement is louder and sharper.
Feel free to make your own markings with pencil, but do not forget that the markings on the bowed instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, her two young sons (Maria Theresa, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles in front of the panicked queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to pay off most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that floated on behalf of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
The super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would now constitute the main profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The period of European history in which these events occur is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between the years 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that comprises, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the fate of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one might argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily derives from the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The massive use of cars also leads to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in Romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered such in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 BC and extended until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status declined, especially because the returning crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was then transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style was in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles may be some 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of that era was the introduction of buttons to fasten garments, a product of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is defined as farming which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family group alone.
Subsistence farming is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds native to the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the farmers' main activity was subsistence farming, which is still practised in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social norms and give them the possibility to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of its members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to it by resorting to the distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growing up.
Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents, and in some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered traumatic situations or severe childhood abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals and some to have lived on their own in the wild.
When the feral child is raised exclusively by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost in a whole equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make that process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; rather, it is an assistance that provides support to those who are going through a new experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual formats; in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but so is the little animated paper holder in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can see that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving guardians, sustained education and reliable health care.
The aim of foster care is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet brings together and mixes the components of mass and interpersonal communication.
The various features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), personal engagement and long-lasting relationships were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, important breakthroughs have been made in interpreting microexpressions, which are facial movements of only a few milliseconds in duration.
Specifically, it is claimed that by properly reading their microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, nevertheless, accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that the abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the 20th century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; that of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between one and the other generation after generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources at its disposal.
Moreover, failure to do so leads to serious problems - slowing growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins in leaves and vegetables would have been the most readily available source of plant resources, but they are not easily digestible by primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, egg) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In short, it should not surprise us if our own predecessors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the intentional waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished by a more or less gentle alarm clock that will bring you back to a conscious state, though without waking you up completely.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process.In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options based on the biological rhythm are to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive life force we have, and each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment, the only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they were spread by the Mahayana path of love and numerous yoga techniques from India.
In general terms, secularism is very simple, based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is activated with yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga, through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be unblocked, chakras can be activated, and enlightened consciousness can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would spread over the next 40 years and be fought in real life, through surrogate militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Because by 17 September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to give up and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army fighters from the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's role has always been to ensure that your country retains the power to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II provides one of the clearest and most recent examples of this.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cancel this circulation.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
For the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and leather, ancient peoples and tribes began to stay with them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the more popular shepherd.
In England, railways had been established by the 16th century.
Even though the wagon rails were made of simple parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
The addition of sleepers to hold the rails in place was quite early, but gradually it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were lined with iron at the top.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused more wear on the wagon wheels, which were made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones, and in 1767 solid iron rails began to be used.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans began to do so in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedation have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more friendly to the planet, join environmental movements, or even become activists and fight to reduce, to some extent, future suffering.
It's, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment, but if we're not looking for just a temporary situation, we should be looking at the root of the problems and trying to deactivate them.
Clearly, the world has undergone great changes as a result of mankind's technological and scientific advances, and the problems have been intensified by overpopulation and extravagant life-styles.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the Dunlap Copies.
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did so in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6 a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his army in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap photographs known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A lot of paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today: it's the birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly, clawed limbs, lay eggs, and move about on their hind legs just like the T-Rex.
Today, almost all computers are based on the manipulation of data encoded in the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be to find an open bottle of toxic medication or cleaning chemicals.
Read the label for specific information on first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with bedbugs, a highly developed species to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and killer bed bugs are nest-builders; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is close to 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the junction of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, is the target of MS.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples could choose to plan on adopting a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different partner can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method, which is the guiding principle for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on classical works, especially the Latin version of the Bible text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially the questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots in both philosophy and science.
Many rhythms in physiological processes and behaviour are often decisively dependent on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks oscillate self-sustaining and have a period of free cyclic operation, even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a genetic-type material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while those occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities at the site are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, and ecosystem information study.
One example is to visit, take photographs and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on the use of private cars, and they sustain it.
Now, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is not common to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the transport sector is not left behind by the current crisis, and that the transport sector is not left behind by the current crisis.
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not a simple task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to maintain relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to have logical consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
In order to more clearly plot the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
Such relationships facilitate both the planning and design and the operations of the road devices.
The first species to take to the air were insects, which helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards, tapping them to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them a larger range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Today, anisopters and ephemeropters are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth you don't perceive their movement, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second largest river on the planet, containing eight times as much water as the next largest river.
Furthermore, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, at some points as much as six miles wide.
Of the total water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent is drawn from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they could never surpass those at Giza, either in size or in the sublimity of their building technique.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which by then dated back over a millennium.
With about 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both for the drafting of its regulations and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by most of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The majority of the citizens living in Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more similar to the states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only at the same time, he had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloy is basically a combination of two or more metals, and remember, the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and there are also metals such as gold and silver.
Alloys may also exist with the presence of small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are not metals.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively tiny that the endpoint of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
So when it was invented, the pencil won many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Nowadays, people type messages on their computer screens without even having to go near a notebook.
The only question is what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy truck up a hill, and when you split the nucleus once more, you release some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to decay with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because its crust is thinner, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what people are attracted to or like.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour that can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue to be one of the boys (or girls).
Managers in this category have difficulty making decisions that offend employees, imposing disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities and holding staff accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, he mutates into an unrecognizable person who believes it necessary to change everything the group has been doing so far and do it his way.
Ultimately, the ultimate responsible for the team's success and failure is the leader.
This behaviour often ends up alienating the leaders from the other team members.
The same standards of excellence that conventional equipment handles apply to virtual ones, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team act as a point of contact for their nearest physical group.
They generally enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, as it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones which, for example, might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a feature unique to virtual teams.
The 'invisible team' is the group in charge of management, to which each member reports, and which sets the standards for each member.
What could be the motivation for an organisation to undergo the complainant process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organisation, room is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organization working in a team to overcome a difficulty will give way to a new innovative process in order to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, thereby narrowing the field of research and making it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is a contributor to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental function.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the ability to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to develop simulation models, which further our understanding of mental processes.
While AI is often associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of great relevance within computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These questions have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the sectors of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, in the same way that it was incorporated into various video game software applications and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom, and it is not uncommon for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions, where students can look at the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital and each year the page is updated, but previous versions are kept online in the form of a memory album.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills, and although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when an audience is present.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to work on improving his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "demands that students be more understanding of the world around them" and the need to spark the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
Proper use of blogs can empower learners to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, they can define their own positions in the context of others' writings, as well as establish their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries showcasing the country's history and present.
Niagara Falls is further south and the north shelters the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and the expanse that follows.
All of these and other aspects are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas farther north are sparsely populated and some are wilderness, almost uninhabited.
To make a demographic comparison that comes as a big surprise to many, there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The location of the East African islands is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial pinnacle of European influence and colonialism occurred in the 15th century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route linking Cape Europe with India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advised that all female visitors state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It may also be helpful to wear a ring (just make sure it does not look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, held in the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meronids, who named it Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trifles, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist spot in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, any visit abroad should be considered in order to take stock of the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla sighting tours are some of the cheapest in Africa.
To move within Goma, you can opt to take a wedding-wedding (mototaxi).The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, along with its relative inaccessibility, has given Timbuktu an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although Timbuktu is now an impoverished city, it still has an airport and a reputation as a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, a result of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which has a different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is recognised as the main icon of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all nature reserves in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It may also be convenient to purchase a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all of the country's National Parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of the same name, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The display of buildings that mark the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a luminous bar chart evidenced by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront, located opposite.
It is in the reclaimed land on the north coast of Hong Kong that its urban development is densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the region's colonial past, it's a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove chain, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The section of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Notwithstanding this, the forests are not just mangroves but also some of the last remaining trees of the towering jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extent is covered by water or wetlands.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those travelling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have Japanese Coaster bus service, which is comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is an agile and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed structure that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that now constitutes eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other aboriginal groups, for example, the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished for a living.
Paraguay, formerly known as The Giant Province of the Indies, was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization phase, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous idiosyncrasy and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Other lower-level tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
On the website of the Argentine Polo Association you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is set at parity with the British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands where you can change your money, it's in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds are usually accepted anywhere within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
Chances are that the outlying islands will not accept credit cards, but you could use British or American money.
It is virtually impossible to change Falkland Islands money outside the archipelago, so make sure you do so before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive. Although temperatures below freezing are very rare, wind and moisture interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, so it should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wildlife.
No matter how tame they may appear, bison, wallabies, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can become aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially wild, so respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid having or cooking foods that give off strong scents and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval clash when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships except one British cruiser, killing about 200 American and German personnel.
During the war for independence that faced the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two harbours.
In the North Harbour district, on the Pacific Ocean, are the North Shore beaches, which stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe places to swim and mostly have pohutukawa trees that offer shade spots.
The Waitemata harbour is home to the beaches of Tamaki Drive, in the extravagant Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods of central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very busy, with numerous and varied shops available on the thing. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia might be considered better for transportation.
The local tap water is completely safe for you to drink, but if you are worried, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of "flat white" coffee to be foreign. A small black coffee is called an "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (rather than foam), and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare there.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, and occasionally outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of them are afraid of them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers located north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives you peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but they can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers to and from the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can also save the reservation for you in case you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees of musical events choose to camp on-site and most spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you'll need to arrive at the camp early to secure a spot near the musical events.
It should be noted that while the musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival they could continue until the wee hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas, designed for family groups with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice creates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During cruises around St Petersburg, time is also spent in the city.
Usually, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money their customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special promotions of food, drink and entertainment in order to keep guests in good spirits and inside the facilities.
Some establishments serve free spirits, although drunkenness affects judgment and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who plans to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should anticipate the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you do on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall that it can be trapped in a very short time.
In addition, visibility may be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice forming on car windows.
Furthermore, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the most memorable part for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to overland travel to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, will often approach vehicles and standard equipment will make good vision possible.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be shy, so you will have more opportunity to observe them with binoculars.
The excursion known as a walking safari (also called a bushwalk, hiking safari or walking tour) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between 24 August and 5 September 2021.[1] A number of events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Host of the 1964 Games, Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the announcement of the postponement, complications may arise.

On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most challenging driving conditions and often traverses secluded and lonely terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves.
The posted speed limits are notably lower than on the sections before and after it, usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and their strict adherence is even more important than on any other section.
Interestingly, though, the cell signal is much better here than on many other sections of the highway like Pennsylvania Wilds.

The stirrups are the supports for the feet of the riders that hang on either side of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability to the rider, they can present safety problems, as it is possible for their feet to get stuck on them.
If a rider is thrown from the horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel that has a straight and fairly narrow sole.
In addition, there are mounts, especially English mounts, with safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to detach from its structure if a rider who is fired pulls back.
The Cochamó Valley is Chile's most popular climbing destination and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of extensive walls and granite cliffs.

Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
In satisfactory conditions, it will manage to cover slightly longer distances than if it does so on foot, but it will very rarely reach cross-country skiing speed without a good-weight backpack on conditioned tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to handle visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as one country in this respect.
Generally, whenever you move within this region you can cross the borders without going through a passport control post again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to deal with the separate permits for each Schengen country, which saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion for determining when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit might be more narrow in places like North America than in Europe.
It may be the case that handmade products are classified as antiques, even though they are newer than goods of similar characteristics manufactured in series.

Once you've escaped the current, swimming back will be no more complex than usual.
Make an attempt to reach somewhere where you can't reach it again or, if you have the skills and someone has seen you, it might be convenient to wait for rescue.

When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.

Finland is a great sailing destination: the 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht on the archipelago and the lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak provide a different experience.
Boating is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.

If you did an air freight shipment, on some routes it may have taken days for unloading and customs.
The only way to make it faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations prohibit carrying baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to travel first or business class on an airplane is to spend a fortune for that privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for you).
