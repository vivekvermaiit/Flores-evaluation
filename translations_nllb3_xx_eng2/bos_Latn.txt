Not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a known theory, but it also provides details that fossils usually can't provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say the animal's feathers were chestnut-brown on top, with a pale or yellow-orange-red underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed speciality called the rachis, but have other feather characteristics - spikes and tiny spikes - researchers have concluded that the rachis is likely part of a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of these feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for regulating temperature or appearance.
Studies have shown that even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not chicken feathers.
A car bomb detonated yesterday at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring over twenty others.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to mimic observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and thus causes the tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter is found around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and it's made up of lots of tiny particles.

They're colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but is consistent with the fact that they are deep cavities in the ground", said Glen Cushing, a member of the Astrogeological team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is done without technology, with voters isolating themselves in a booth and putting a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope to indicate the candidate they want to vote for.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
These procedures are pretty strictly regulated by French election law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are put in the box by those who have been duly counted and authorized to vote.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor every part of the process, and in the evenings, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated: "We have arrested five persons who raped a Swiss woman and we have found and returned her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services pulled the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since appeared in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court, charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness evidence can be denied because her picture has been posted many times.
It's a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently and the courts have considered it possible that publishing the photograph could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are really walking a fine line if they publish photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is solely responsible for the criminal prosecution, has indicated to reporters that it will not be making any further comment, at least until charges are filed.
The document will, according to leaked information, address a border dispute that Palestine wants to base on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations which is a problem in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in this valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA accepts a military presence of only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control pilot program should have been under the watchful eye of the rangers, since the pilot program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited, in accordance with the Sporting Archery Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), nine members took the oath before Martelly.
This is Martelli's fifth C.E.P. in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous CEP resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
At times, violent protests have been sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had information on 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company said were "not serious".
The State Department responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (Friday 09:19 pm GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Mariana Islands has announced that there have been no reports of damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no tsunami indicators.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six are confirmed dead.
Earlier, six hostages were released, including children, the elderly and photographers from the Philippines.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly lady when she needed to go to the bathroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the State Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he spent his spare time researching preterm birth.
His research showed that the introduction of hormones will accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
The Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and Luna passed away at two months old, pretty unique, just like her, a strong woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented "Luna was as weird as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and I'll miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
As part of the campaign for the 2010 federal election, the Prime Minister of the transitional government Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those polled who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch in Australia.
The poll showed two types of extreme views: 29 percent of those polled thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three stages at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition is in doubt due to a complaint.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to relieve the pain because those drugs are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February using various hardware and software, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source for bringing water to Earth along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors political chatter and nonsense.
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of outdated ground-based radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport will be involved and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and bus transfer stations are not available near the stadium.
Fears of a lack of transportation have increased the likelihood that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science made claims about the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden say that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the process took much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza forte, and the migratory cactus frog, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made in many different shapes, and it can be wrapped in small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be wound and entangled, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and attached to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH value of a chemical substance, and you can make an indicator using the juice of a red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders, then with clean, wet hands, make a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will lead to a strange sensation and create a kind of protection.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in homes in the mining towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would stay together in mixed society.
When you call someone who's miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the signal, then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, there are many small cats (including lost pet cats) that eat much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special skill that every cat possesses and that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats and live in large groups called herds.
The herd consists of one to three adult males in a litter and up to 30 females and young.
The women are usually closely related to each other because it's a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to wolf packs or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and also very deadly to their prey.
Like a true multi-sport athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group with the lion, leopard and jaguar, and these are the only four cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's full-throated roar, but more like a sentence of angry shouting words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals, and if he can, he will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that ocelots track and locate prey animals by scent by sniffing out the soil on which they have been.
They see very well in the dark because of their night vision, and they move very quietly, and the ocelots hunt by blending in with the environment, and then they jump on the prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, when crossing a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment that is different from the environment in which they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, to represent a strong competitor, will need different characteristics or adaptations than what was needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and they still need to adapt as much as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which just means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce food by photosynthesizing with the sun.
We build houses and make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws contained over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra row of teeth in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no salvation for any creature that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a hooked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't keep up with it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans also feasted on some strange or unusual foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called the puff
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to host banquets together where they would laze on their hips while they ate.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no old Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, and it was considered the home of that deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that could only be accessed by the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house wasn't that important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open cash registers facing the street.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so the wood was incredibly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence says a treasure map.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (293-inch by 241⁄2 inches) was originally wrapped and placed in an archive.
So it's possible that the note was added simply as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
The north of France was ruled by the French of the Visigoths, who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an attack that was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and it's related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it kind of defines the size of society.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a long-lasting cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind any relevant historical evidence and without being recognized as true civilizations.
Under the Articles of Confederation, during the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, whose only component was the Congress.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state agencies to enforce its laws, which were often uncooperative.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Members sought the full consent of all states before they could be changed, and states understood the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful national team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the clusters of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago from a geographical perspective
The origins of Taiwan go back to the 15th century when passing European sailors noted the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiated a change in aboriginal grain production practices, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
After its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
At Machu Picchu there are three main buildings - the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and the restoration has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image format in the world is 35 mm, which dominated at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, the format of the display is taken from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing - 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, the ratio of the proportions of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of the whole number) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this scale of proportions.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in the picture.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under control.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together despite their different languages and customs.
Its dominant power affected everyone - from kings to commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds serve that very purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has many people wondering if this rule is being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of the conflict, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective in disrupting the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade has violated internationally accepted law codified in several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain had mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering parts of the ocean, causing danger even to ships of neutral countries.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited warfare under the sea.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and crimes of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he had accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods, each phase of Chinese history or each ruling family was a distinctive dynasty.
Also, the period between each dynasty represented a period of divided provinces, the most famous such period being the Three Kingdoms era which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the top spot in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to the ruler alone.
Also, after the occupations of the revolution were opened up to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of ranking by class, military ranks are now ranked by caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life, and he often spent time in the cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor (Light) and meditated.
The cave itself, which has survived all time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or necropolis of Giza in Egypt's Valley of the Dead is home to a series of pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "tilt upward" designation looks like a V, and the "tilt downward" like a connector or a square with a missing bottom.
Up means you have to start from the top and push the paddle, and down means you have to start from the frog (where your hand holds the paddle) and pull the paddle.
An upward swing usually produces a softer sound, while a downward swing is louder and more declarative.
You may write your own markings in pencil, but remember that the markings of the pendulum are printed for the purpose of music, and they must be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women from the market on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and shouting threats at the king and queen.
A mob forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriages wide open.
At one point, a mobster waved the head of a member of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds that were launched on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the basic gain of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that prompted the founding of the order.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is conventionally decided to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from a technological urge or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is governed by a basic logic connected to the laws of science and their representation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond the influence of culture or politics, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, which has led to new manufacturing methods being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to more road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with those geographical areas emerged and they were, in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renowned epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued above anything the Byzantine market offered.
At that time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of the slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was when people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that aims to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds from a particular ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient in agricultural production, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar worldviews who feel that social norms neglect them and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be recognizable by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often show their affiliation through a specific and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point to several unfortunate cases of children who were not given the opportunity to socialize by adults during their development due to neglect, accident or intentional abuse.
Some wild children were imprisoned (usually by their parents); in some cases, children were rejected because their parents rejected their serious intellectual or physical deficiencies.
Abandoned children may have experienced violence or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
The others are thought to have been raised by animals, some thought to have lived on their own in the wild.
After being raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that closely resembles the behavior of the animal that cared for it, such as fear and indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the method of "scaffolding" goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to help provide support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Help can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of help but also a little human stapler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in software and are intended to test, instruct and explain procedures that might present a challenge for the student to perform independently.
Children enter the foster care system for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where there is no care, tenderness and education, but it is happening.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should meet all needs that were unmet in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access benefits and needs satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
When investigating audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified personal engagement and continued connections as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, The Presidential Address, suggested that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still correctly assess honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century pointed to the fact that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection is removal from a group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix variations between these two bases in each generation.
A primate with a digestive system like humans, in the savannah, may find it difficult to meet the amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so leads to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and beans, but they're difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a vast amount of protein containing essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees do it in the savannahs today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and going back to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you happen to reset the alarm clock in your sleep, you can leave it on the other side of the room so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bedtime, which will cause the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is the opposite of the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive life force there is, and each person has the potential to find their absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it's been extended by the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of total love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga, and through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, the conflicts between systems, processes and cultures led to disagreements between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be conducted in real life, through proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were virtually rendered obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 troops from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of eastern parts of Poland, thereby violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting large amounts of goods and large numbers of people across the ocean.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that the country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously impeding the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this practice is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to provide aid to Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mostly using U-boats, was trying to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated almost 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were most commonly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often tended by goats, mostly children or adolescents, who are similar to today's shepherds.
Wagons were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull more loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Railroad sleepers were introduced early on to secure tracks, but it was gradually realized that tracks would be much more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and the first full-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known transportation was walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not accustomed to walking upright.
Bipedal specialization has been observed in fossil Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although there is a possibility that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed considerably because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have been made worse by overpopulation and the extravagant way people live.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby John Dunlap Printing House.
Between 150 and 200 were made overnight, known today as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of this document was given by John Nixon on July 8th, in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th.
The 25 Dunlap posters known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with spikes and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two possible values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are fairly common enough to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open box of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists in a formal context for this group of insects.
This term comes from an ancient familiarity with the rodent, an insect that is highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the killer worm and the common bug are gray, adapted to living in their host's nest or housing complex.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease of younger adults and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to get MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise the baby.
These couples can make the decision to make a plan to adopt a baby.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to determine how the world works, and in fact, it is the method that guides most scientific research.
However, it's not just experimenting, and an experiment is a test that is used to remove one or more possible hypotheses, but asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greece dwindled, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in a wide range of living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to run even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments where they tagged DNA in a flask with radioactive phosphorus or they tagged the protein of a flask with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of a particular part of the genetic material, and whether the cells affected are stem cells.
Only mutations in the host cells can be passed on to children, and mutations in other sites can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, taking photos, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of their small towns on the outskirts to go to their jobs, passing by those who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and supportive, a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Science now shows that this high-carbon economy has thrown the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges that are falling apart.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave quite consistently, so traffic has some sort of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flows, links are established between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and search for food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings backwards today are the fairy horses and the water lilies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but most believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
It makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it has more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of construction.
The new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of the country's employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are of the Roman Catholic faith.
People have known since ancient times about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper because they can all be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily exploited using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything was made from a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also had the theory that they change into new substances and build what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many after it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer writing systems, the pen has fallen into a lower status and is used less frequently.
People now write messages on computers and never have to get a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The physics bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with a mass of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy chariot up a hill, and then splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas, and thicker under the mountains.
On the near side, there may be more maria because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are about finding out what makes people behave or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have evolved during maturation toward adulthood.
These theories look at what it is that makes some people want what they do and what in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of satisfaction are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two types of behavior that can occur when managers start leading their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating staff, assigning tasks and demanding accountability from employees.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has been working on and make it their own.
After all, it's the leader who ultimately bears responsibility for both the team's success and its failure.
This kind of behavior often results in disagreements between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, yet there are no small differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than other team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The Invisible Team is a management team to which each member is accountable, and this team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and genius can emerge.
As a result, an organization's process of collaborating to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, management must establish a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, and so they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Advances in new technologies are allowing us to observe and explore brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction context, it represents an extremely important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and sequencing, the ability to provide responses to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that are focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been incorporated into several home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours, where students can look at artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
A virtual trip is also a great way to look back on the trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year, students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and that website changes every year, but the old versions are kept online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to seek to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "encourages students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to build up the interests of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
By actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others are writing and can express their own opinion on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The city of Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, home to a multitude of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the untapped natural beauties of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more makes Ontario what outsiders consider to be essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some represent almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the southern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and represents a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, which was especially established on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female passengers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It might help if you're wearing a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they would consider harassment and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, hold their hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences notwithstanding, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Darou l-Baja, and the name Casablanca was given to it by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases at the site.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as pasta, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and the whole spectrum of geomatics, but it's all made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city streets, especially downtown.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
This city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano with one of the cheapest ascents of the Mountain Gorilla in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is approximately 500 Congolese francs.
Due to the fact that it is quite inaccessible, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport has made it a popular destination.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations during the PBS special Wonders of the African World hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming the southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be the leading South African National Park (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily fees for protection and entry.
It may be useful to buy a Wild Card that can be used to enter some parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider a highlight of their visit.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong is linked to a brilliant graph that is visible thanks to the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon Harbour on the other side.
Most of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is densely located on the landward side of the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, you can start here.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Yet, forests are not just salt marshes - they include some of the last remaining of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which almost one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that about 400 royal Bengal tigers and close to 30,000 colourful deer live in the area today.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended that tickets be purchased a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxi rides are a quick and easy way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyjapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 273 feet high, are 1,900 feet long, and have two lanes that are 12 feet wide.
The freeway height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous community living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, gathering fruit and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Jewel Province of the Indies", was founded in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors encountered indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Here, and at any other time of the year, you can watch small tournaments and games.
For news on tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British Pound (GBP).
In the islands, money can be exchanged at the only bank located in Stanley, across the street from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in remote islands, although British currency and United States currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners as to which payment method is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there at the time when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; in the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but due to the combination of wind and humidity, it appears colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human encounters, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or harassed.
The park owners are telling you to stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Despite their appearance of obedience, bison, moose, deer, mice, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Additionally, bear in mind that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells bad and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of the infamous naval blockade of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city ended with the assassination of Tupou chieftain Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is bordered by two harbours.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch along Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and many are sheltered by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, a suburb of the upper Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is N°1, which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea is a straight white coffee side, a short black is an espresso, a cappuccino is topped with lots of top (not foam), and the tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're excellent.
There are trips to the reef year-round, and reef injuries are rare.
Still, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The Cubomondas appear near the beach and the mouth of the river from October to April, north of the town in 1770.
Sharks do, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles don't live in the ocean all the time, their primary habitat is the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind because he knows that he will have accommodations once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, although you may see that other types of accommodation, such as camping, can be booked through the agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotel accommodation.
They can hold your reservation if you want to reconsider the offer or take out other documents needed to travel to that destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
When it comes to some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to take a camping spot near the music.
Remember that while the music content on the main stages is over, there may be some parts of the festival that will play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin position because going through the ice causes terrible noise for those who are most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the money and time spent by guests, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment deals to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them in the facilities.
In some places alcoholic beverages are served on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all experienced gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitude or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and it's not possible to drive like on a clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, it can fall fast enough to get you stuck.
Visibility may be limited by snow falling or thunderstorms or condensation or ice appearing on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many lands, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the best tourist experience in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey overland to see the stunning wilds of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and standard equipment will give you a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and can be seen better if you look through binoculars.
A safari walk (also known as a bushwalk, safari hike, or hiking) consists of a hike of several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some sporting events also taking place at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already done so in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the standard ticket costing about 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can speed up drying, and many hotels offer to lend you a washing board and ironing board, even if it is not in the room.
If ironing is not available or you do not like to wear ironing socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective depending on the specific threat.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they have not seen in their own backyards.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people, are not usually classified as pests.
Shopping at duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy products that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging conditions for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as the road often passes through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay calm: the road is dominated by steep terrain, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, cell phone reception here is much stronger than on many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those made by their southern neighbours, the Austrians.
Fruit cakes are common - apples are cooked in a batter throughout the year, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try the pastry that, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. Coconut milk is often used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional gastronomy that is present throughout the nation.
But when used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, features a range of simply spiced dishes. The dominant flavors that Javanese people like are peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The spurs are the supports for the rider's feet that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but they can cause safety problems because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse and his foot is left in the stirrup, the horse could pull him back in case he starts running.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a flat, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety levers that allow the leather struts to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls them in a fall.
In the Cochamo Valley - the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Josemite of South America - there are various granite walls and fissures.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes through its endless potential walls.
Snowsports involving downhill skiing, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you descend the snow-covered terrain on skis or boards attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main travel activity of many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski nuts", who plan entire vacations in terms of skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski-touring, or ski-walking.
It is related to alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, but usually does not include them, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a trail that's similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking, but you will rarely reach the speed of skiing without a heavy backpack and on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, and in standard circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through visa and passport controls multiple times.

Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antiques, but some tax agencies define antiques as objects that are over 100 years old.

Today, many Sámi people are engaged in modern trade, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area where the Sámi live.

Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications dealing with the subject of war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for the return journey.
There is a disparate willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify a gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to act on these documents also varies widely.
Checkpoint raids also became much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through a scan and retain their privacy and dignity.
Reverse ocean currents are the back-flow of waves that hit the shore, often a reef or something.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper parts and there can be a fast current towards the deep water.
Most deaths occur from fatigue that occurs when a swimmer tries to swim with the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're off the current, swimming back isn't any harder than it used to be.

When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.

The activity is almost the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic Sea cruises involve an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days, and then come back to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore as part of a boat trip, you will not need a special visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises in their brochures include Berlin, Germany, as you can see on the map, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
