This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already in abundance, but provides an explanation that fossils typically cannot show color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the wings of this animal were a pale-brown color from above and pearly or carotenoid color from below.
These findings shed light on the evolution of wings in birds.
Because the dinosaurs' wings did not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but other features of the wings - barbs and barbels - the researchers speculated that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests they were used not in flight but for temperature regulation or demonstration.The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings rather than a flipper underneath.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be due to the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon creates a pull on the Earth, producing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter does.
The theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a type of halo around a galaxy, and is composed of many smaller particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, putting a pre-printed sheet of paper depicting the candidate of their choice into an envelope.
After the voter's identity is verified by officials, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of voting and no envelopes have been added except those properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process; in the evenings, following specific procedures, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy surveillance.

This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have seen the publication of the photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists walk a dangerous line when publishing photos of suspects etc".
The Crown Office, which is overall in charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the prosecution is brought.
The document, according to the leak, would mention the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem which is sacred to both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel seeks an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
In the supplementary pest control trials the shooters were monitored by rangers, as the trials were monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, in partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks conservation and heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive protection and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday at a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests were initiated due to the failure to hold elections, some as late as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod malfunction, with a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported to it 34 additional overheating events, which the company termed "non-critical".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 7:19 a.m. local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Marianas said there were no reports of any damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A Hong Kong tourist bus is hijacked by a retired Filipino policeman in Manila, Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead so far.
A total of 6 people, both children and adults, including the photographer, were released shortly afterwards.
The photographers then replaced an elderly woman who had gone to the toilet, and in this way Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps by pursuing a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm labor pains in her spare time.
Their research shows that if a hormone is administered it will accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Acostre. I was the first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons.
Dustin "Goldie" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as we were ... maybe even more so ... love her and miss her ... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34 per cent of those surveyed, who wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the survey, 29 per cent of those surveyed believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believed Australia should never become a republic.
Olympic gold medalists have swum the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle and the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but their fitness is in doubt due to complaints about their appearance.
He has been unable to take the medications needed to relieve his pain as he has been banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Various people verified the discovery using various hardware and software by early February and another was announced on Tuesday.
Comets would have likely been sources of organic matter as well as water on Earth that could have made proteins and supported life.
Scientists have come to expect understanding of how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his rule earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "political nonsense and idiocy".
He is also rumored to be running for President in 2016.
The FAA claims NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and cut carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to point aircraft with greater accuracy and give more precise information to pilots.
No additional transport is being charged and no overground trains stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that team supporters would be forced to play games behind closed doors without winning.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process takes longer due to cross-breeding between a local Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortressus, and a migrant cactus, Finch, Geospiza connerostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes; the agora can be modelled into smaller sizes.
Agoras can be drawn in thin wires, which can be twisted and plated. Agoras can be engraved or rolled in sheets.
The agora could be made very thin, and could be glued to other metals. The agora could be so thin that the agora was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
The Agoras call a chemical pH. They can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons knocked out of them (as hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Twist two dry lime pieces together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in the open hand would react with the outer layers, which would appear abrasive and form a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia and China also had toilets.In Roman civilization, the toilet was sometimes part of a public bath where men and women would sit together in mixed company.
When you are calling someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and then bounce it back to the Agora almost immediately.
Satellites were launched into space by a rocket.Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision we see.
A giant rocket over 100 feet high is required to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways; the biggest thing the wheel has done for us is provide us with much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and deer.
Finally, there are many smaller cats (including the loose domestic cat) which eat many smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special job that each cat has that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called a pride.
The pride is made up of one to three related adult males, as well as thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to each other because they have a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion Pride acts much like a pack of wolves or dogs, the animals behave surprisingly similarly to lions (but not other large cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, Tiger could climb (though not as well), swim, leap long distances and pull in five times the strength of a stronger human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather like the consonant of hoarse, shouted words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals; it will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can. Almost all animals that prey on the ocelot are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that oscillators follow and seek out prey by smell, where they stay on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and can also move very stealthily. Osceotes hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings.
When a small group of living things (a small population) migrates away from the main population from which they came (such as by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they can't easily get back to where they started) they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they left before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than the previous one.
The native populations have not changed at all, they still need to adapt as much as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, which means the creation of new species.Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and take in the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis; they also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurs were top predators of their time and thus were fearless, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were lined with over 70 incisors sharp teeth, with an additional set at the top of their mouths that meant nothing could pass through them.
We cannot say for sure, but the agora test could have been very strange. The agora diet may have included turtles, big fish and other shrimp, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It would also have attacked if anything came underwater, so much so that even a giant dinosaur would not have been able to survive further.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had strange or unusual feasting objects as part of their diet, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that where the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men preferred to dine together, where they had their own place, while they lived together.
Ancient Roman cuisine may not have included the foods that in later centuries would have been brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods which was considered the house of the god.
People would make offerings to the deities and the priests would try to fulfill the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped minarets, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary to the deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyards; the stores had open counters that faced the street.
Canaan lacked extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled; in the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while travelling further west, found Greenland and renamed it Greenland.
But regardless of their discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the National Treasure films, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although the document has some inscription on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote the Agora, it is known that early in its life, large parchment documents (the Agora measuring 293⁄4 inches x 241⁄2 inches) were rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added as merely a label.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
These "Witches" were ruled by the French; it was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them rather than fighting the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in an invasion dubbed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinctive culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, called a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, related to the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civis, meaning city or city-state, and also in some ways defined the shape of the letter S.
City-states are the precursors of nations.A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a steady cultural footprint, and an equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it was dependent on state officials to enforce its suzerainty, which was often uncooperative.
They had no power to override tax laws and duties between states.
Consensus of all the states was required before the clause could be amended and the states brought the central government to such a screeching halt that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international sports and Olympic events.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan is often, for geographical purposes, referred to as an archipelago because of the cluster/group of islands within Japan.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors crossed from and named Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwest Taiwan, and began a change in ancient methods of grain production by employing Chinese workers in its rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces captured the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 proclaimed Taiwan a vassal state of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 - 1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, such as the Intihuatna, the Sun Temple, and the Chamber with Three Windows.
To give the tourist a better sense of what they initially looked like, most of the buildings at the ends of the complex were reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most widely used 35 mm still photograph in the world is the 35 mm, which was the most effective film size at the end of the analogue film era.
They are still manufactured today, but their length-to-height ratio is derived from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, being 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The width-to-height ratio of this format (to divide by 12 to get the usual integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the -APS family format) are equal to or very close to these aspect ratios.
The much-admired and often-derided rule of thirds is a guideline for maintaining order in photographs with a sense of humor.
This says that the most effective location for the main subject is the incision point of the line dividing the photo into horizontal and vertical thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become richer and more powerful, rose in prominence.
Christianity held the kingdoms of Europe together for over a thousand years despite their differences in language and customs.
A more all-pervasive power had affected everyone from the king to the common man.
A core Christian doctrine holds that the use of money should be to relieve suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are specifically for this.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this doctrine was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
This tactic proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though the blockade violated generally accepted international rules codified under various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain built tunnels into the international water boundary to prevent any ships from entering the entire area of the sea, thus endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response to this strategy was limited, Germany had hoped for a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and the country were pacifism and isolationism.
In view of the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, countries wished to avoid similar situations in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, taking a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachler (his former manager at the company) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had unique ways of showing different time periods; each of the stages or dynasties that held power in China was a distinct dynasty.
There were interregnum eras of kingdom-division between each dynasty; the most famous of the interregnum periods between the Han and Jin dynasties are the three dynasties that ruled for 60 years.
This period saw fierce wars for the throne between many of the kings.
The Three Dynasties period was the bloodiest era in the history of ancient China as thousands of people were killed in battles for the largest throne in the magnificent palace at Xi'an.
There are also many perceived social and political influences such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism and the idea that the state belongs to the people and not to a king.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, the most ambitious and fortunate of whom succeeded.
The same system was applied in the military as army ranks based on class became merit-based.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in the country to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He frequently visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (the light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which had long since ceased to exist, contains a very vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find an agora even if one knows it exists; once inside a cave, it is completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built for Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper arch looks like a V and the "downer arch" like a staple or square with the bottom missing.
Up means you have to push the arc starting from the tip, and down means you have to pull the arc starting from the frog (where your hand is holding the arc).
Upward arcs typically produce a softer sound, while downward arcs are stronger and more vocal.
Feel free to mark in your own number, but remember that printed boeing numbers are for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market women.
Boarding a carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a mob shouting and threatening against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open.
At one point a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles in front of a frightened queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay a large part of the expenses of the American colonial regime and interest on bonds issued through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long exploitation of Filipinos was the core benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that by itself encompasses a very large range of ideas.Technology-push or technological imperative means directly that we human beings are driven by a logic that is associated with scientific laws and their expression in technology.
Most explanations, in technical parlance, revolve around two general ideas: that the development of technology follows another path than the cultural or political impact itself, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on society from within, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that roads developed because of motor cars.
Although the road network stretching across a vast country is not for cars alone, work is underway on ways to make the cost of cars work by new methods of production.
Having more cars than necessary also increases the risk of accidents which leads to new technologies in health care to be discovered to repair the damaged body.
A major component of nihilism was cultural determinism, drawn from such writers as Goethe, Fitch and Schlegel.
In the context of nihilism, geography molded people, and in time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being more in keeping with the location of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris has been known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered to be the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Their reputation as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until about 1100 AD.
The situation deteriorated further during the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets had to offer.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the style in the West lagged 25 to 30 years behind that of the West.
In the late Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style; one of the major developments of the time was the use of buttons to tie cloth, as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, mostly organic system that utilizes seeds saved in that ecological zone in combination with crop cycles or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized according to social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be particular because of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The traits that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of all of these elements.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashions, mannerisms and dialects.
One of the most common methods used to explain the importance of socialization is to note some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults when they were growing up, through neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild". Some feral children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases such abandonment of children has been due to parents' disregard for the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children must have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behavior almost entirely animal-like to caregivers (within bodily limits), such as fear of or apathy for humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that assists people who are gaining experience by learning new things such as how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
The scaffold can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of the scaffold, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and are there to question, point to, and explain processes that might be challenging for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even forcible recruitment.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they are.
We look at the foster care system as a safety net for all these children.
Our foster care system is understood to provide safe homes, loving care, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is expected to meet all the needs that are lacking in the home from which they were first taken.
The Internet serves as a link between both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The Internet is taking on additional dimensions in terms of distinctive properties, uses, and satisfaction.
For example, education and socialization have been shown to be important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Individual engagement" and "continuous engagement" were also identified by Egham and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when examining audience responses to Web sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds at a time.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting the subtle expressions one can detect whether the person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his paper The President's Speech that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He also said that such a capacity to explain human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes the already expressed variation from the group.
Isolation and recombination redistribute variation between the two groups in each generation.
In savannas, primates with digestive systems like humans have a hard time meeting their amino-acid needs from plant resources available to them.
And what's more, failure to do so has serious consequences: developmental depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in the leaves and fruit, but primates like us find these difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Unlike the agora, animal foods (ant, deer, egg) not only digest easily but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some manner similar to how chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is the tendency to wake up well within your normal sleep period and to fall asleep later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a quiet alarm clock to bring yourself to consciousness without waking yourself up completely.
If you can reset the clock in your sleep, then it can be placed on the other side of the room, which you can comfortably get out of bed to turn off.
All other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces people to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the vitality. All humans have the potential to find total peace and contentment.
All can access the information. There is only one thing standing in the way of this goal, and that is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. The Agora Kundalini comprises the paths of yoga, meditation and all-pervading love.
With kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (knowledge energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is diety yoga. Through visions of various deities energy veins are cleansed, chakras are activated and knowledge consciousness is built.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, supported by the USSR and the USA.As the war ended, the country was left out of the war due to conflicts of laws, customs, and cultures.
Two years after the war ended, the Eastern Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought, in real time, by pseudo-armies on the battlefields of many places from Africa to Asia, from Afghanistan to Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already broken down, and the Romanians had only hope of withdrawing and reorganizing along the bridgeheads.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods to carry large numbers of people and goods across the oceans is by far the most efficient method.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move its own people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with their enemy's ability to move their own people and goods.
Yet the most notable recent example is the North Atlantic Campaign of WWII, with the Americans attempting to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
The same German Navy was attempting to stem this traffic, primarily by using U-boats.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain because it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that moved around mountains or other grazing areas, which was especially common with more established shepherds, who were children or adolescents; this method of rearing livestock is still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
But the wagonway had only wooden parallel planks, which helped the horse run faster and pull more weight than the more rugged road in the daytime.
Crosstays to hold tracks in place were introduced long ago; gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if topped with a piece of iron.
This has become common, but the iron wagon has more friction on the wooden wheels.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, with humans having begun to walk upright around two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (i.e. upright man).
Before him, Australopithecus did not walk upright as they had been accustomed to.
Bipedal speciation is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 Ma, although Saelthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
We can all start being more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be doers to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is similar in many ways to symptomatic treatment; however, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem, and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world is changing greatly due to mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the increasingly complex problems caused by overpopulation and humanity's different ways of living.
After the Agora was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlop's printing shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made of the night-time run, now known as "Dunlop Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read the agora to his troops in New York on July 9; another copy reached London on August 10.
25 Dunlop Broadsides still exist which is the oldest surviving copy of the document.The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and still lives today; we call them birds.
Many do not consider them dinosaurs because they had wings and could fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs today.
It has legs with scales and claws, it can lay eggs, and it walks on its two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information which is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - to use computer jargon.
Intrinsic toxicity may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to not be immediately diagnosed.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in the colloquial language of insects.
The term refers to any species of fungus that can survive on humans.
Both blood-sucking insects and aphids are parasites, living in the houses built by others.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which leaves it as the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their children to have children.
The couple may also choose to plan an adoption for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental authority so that another couple can raise the children.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method, the method that actually guides most scientific research.
Although not the only ones, experiment, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observations in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycling even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments either staining DNA with radioactive phosphorus in phages or staining proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells or not.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is known, photographed and learned about the Orcaduangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town to go to their workplace and are passed by other people whose work destination is the place they just left.
Everyone in these dynamic transport shuttles is connected in some way, and supports transport systems based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this huge carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Almost everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems; almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Do transport systems generate such complaints that they fail on a daily basis; that transport engineers are just incompetent; or that something else fundamental is going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within reasonably consistent limits; thus, traffic flows have some reasonable constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be transported by air; their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies are insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the Earth does not appear to be spinning, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth; it carries 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times as wide as six miles.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid-building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and the technical excellence of their construction.
New Kingdom Ancient Egyptians were astonished at the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800; it is the smallest independent country and the least populous country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as they are all detectable in their original forms in nature and were much easier to work with archaic machines.
Aristotle, a scholar of philosophy, ruled that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like the four states of matter (in the same line): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although they also gave rules as to how they would change into the new things that we are.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals; of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that one out of a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing appeared, the pencil was reduced in status and fell into disuse.
People now type messages on computer screens, never having to come close to the sharpener.
One can only imagine what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is required to hold a nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill, splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus which means that they have little or no chance of being separated.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust.The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick nearby and 100 km thick further away.
It is thin under mares and thick under highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side as the crust is thinner; it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding out what attracts or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
This theory looks at what it is about some people that makes them want the same things that we do and what factors in their environment motivate them to do or not do something.
Two popular material theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues - one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, there is the transformation into a stranger, who realizes that he must change everything the team is doing and make it his own.
Yet the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior is often a result of rifts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standard of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of traditional teams because their teams can meet according to different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
What would an organization go through in the process it takes to set up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can be communicated when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, an organization's processes are working together to overcome a barrier, which may lead to a new innovative process to meet customer requirements.
Now before an organization can innovate, leadership must build a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006), describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition; therefore, they narrow the field of research and make it more precise.
The links between brain pathology and behavior help scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes we have never seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our own minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent optimization in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer diagnostics and the ability to answer questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as have been built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher will choose to take their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides a solution with virtual field trips.Students can sit with their class and view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire fine art.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital, the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are put online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students improve writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually replaces the agora.
Since students are often the most important audience, blog writers have started to make attempts to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Also blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them".[32] The need to feed the audience's interest drives students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to learn beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "empowers students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet content, students are able to define their own position in terms of others' writing as well as to frame their own perspectives on particular issues" (Orewek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is home to a series of art galleries and museums that display Canada's past and present.
To the far south are the Niagara Falls and to the north are home to Muscooka and beyond, an area of untouched natural beauty.
This highlights all things and what makes Ontarians best perceived as Canadians by outsiders.
Large areas further north are considerably less populated and some are virtually uninhabited woodlands.
To a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and took it over on a large scale in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler say that she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (not just the one that looks very expensive.
Women should also realize that cultural differences can result in what they believe to be harassment and that it is not uncommon to be harassed and to hold hands, etc.
Be firm in pushing men away, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that's OK!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was already used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meranids as a strategic port called Anafa.
The Portuguese destroyed the Agora and rebuilt it under the name of Agora Casa Branca, only to abandon the Agora after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badja and the Agora was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established the trade base at Oja.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling a whole spectrum of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagin, pottery, leather goods, hooks, and gigos, around the Old Medina, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda, in the east.
In 2002 lava from the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, eroding the dome that closed most of the city's streets and alleys, especially the downtown section.
While Goma is well protected, travel outside Goma should be done carefully to understand the situation of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is the base for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa, as well as for climbing Mount Nyiragongo volcano.
To get around Goma one could take a go-go (motorcycle taxi). The usual fare for a small car was 500 Congolese francs.
With its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for a foreign, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation makes Agora a tourist attraction, and Agora has an airport.
In 1990, Agora was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the highlights during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as Agora has a more Arabic flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Alligator River.
The park spans 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be the crown jewel of the Agora South African National Parks (Sanparks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
Purchasing a wild card can also be beneficial for anyone, granting entry to a selection of one of the parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is where many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a spectacular bar chart illustrated by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon Waterfront opposite.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonialists took their place and so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian interior.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The part of the forest within the Indian Territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Although the forest is not just mangrove swamps - the Agora includes some of the last surviving stands of the mighty forest that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/swamp areas.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 cheetah deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially the eastbound and the Jakarta/Bumthang direction buses, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of traveling to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River connecting the city of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 m, it is 378 m long and the Agora has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 m. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be eliminated.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicur and the Payagua, who survived on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", came into being as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' encounters with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Field in Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
For news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is set at a value equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the islands from the FIC West store located in Stanley, at the only bank in the islands.
British pounds would generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United Kingdom currency can be taken; check with the owner beforehand to determine what the acceptable payment methods are.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is hot there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but air and moisture combine to make it feel colder than with a hand thermometer.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals!
No matter how tame they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep proper distance.These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that the smell attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid transporting or cooking odorous foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa.The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser; about 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasi Lilongwe III.
There are many beaches in Auckland due to the expansion of Auckland's two harbours, three of the best beaches in the area.
The North Shore beach stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south, emptying into the Pacific Ocean.
All of these sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most are shaded by the Pohuatauca tree.
Tamaki Drive beach is on Wetamatata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with many shops on the beaches as well as other necessary amenities for security.
The main local beer is 'number one', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Other local beers are called "manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are scared.
The idea of 'flat white' coffee is alien to Australians; there is a shorter black 'espresso', cappuccino comes higher with cream (not icing), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards.Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many visits to the reef take place throughout the year, and it is rare for an agora to be injured on the reef for any reason.
Nevertheless, consult the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near the coast and river mouths from October through April in the north of 1770, although they can sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, though they rarely attack humans; most sharks are fearful of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat being in the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have somewhere new to sleep once they have reached their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through your travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documentation (such as a visa) for your destination.
However no modifications or requests should be made through the travel agent first rather than directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of concert-goers decide to camp out on-site, and most caterers consider the agora an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to that action, you have to go quickly to get to a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music has ended on the main stage, there may be parts of the festival that continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as there is considerable dreadful noise for those most affected by passing snow.
Cruising to Saint Petersburg includes time in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Casinos usually make several attempts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and getting out can be difficult.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment on offer to keep guests in good mood and keep them on campus.
Some venues serve alcoholic beverages at home; however, drinking interferes with judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying cool.
Anyone who is going to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On snowy and icy roads friction is reduced and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to trap you.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or by condensation on vehicle windows or snow.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and attracts many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips underground to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, will get close to cars and standard equipment will allow good vision.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'd see them better with a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a "busch walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a long hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
You may be in a difficult situation if you have booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced.
The cancellation policy varies, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend beyond the end of March, when the Olympics were scheduled, until July 2020.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000, with typical tickets costing around 7,000.
Ironing moist cloths can help dry them out.Many hotels have iron and ironing boards available for loan, even if none are present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if one does not like to wear iron socks, one can try to use a hairdryer when available.
Be careful not to let the cloth overheat (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are various methods of water purification, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for a minute, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse than agoras can cause allergies, spread poisons, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, do not generally qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to shop at certain locations and buy goods exempt from excise duties.
Travelers bound for heavily taxed countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which passes through distinct backwoods terrain frequently.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep grades, narrow alleys and sharp turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than otherwise.
Funnily enough, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, similar to its southern neighbor, Austria, is quite rich and varied.
Fruit pastry is common, with apples being cooked into the pastry throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastry, try something called berliner, puffancuisine or craffen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With over 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a huge variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
But, if used without further qualifier, the term originally meant food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine consists of a range of dishes commonly experienced with the predominant flavors being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The cradle is the support for the rider's feet that hangs down either side of the pole.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety concerns due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his legs get caught in the bridle, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a chicken, a fairly narrow, sole.
After the agora, some saddles, notably the English saddle, have safety strips that allow a rider's skin to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by the falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its variety of granite big walls and crags.
The summit features breathtaking views from the peak. Mountaineers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes amidst the endless potential of the Acropolis Wall.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve slipping on snow-covered terrain with a snowboard attached to the foot of a ski or a snowboard.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bummies", planning an entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not usually include alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring very rough skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as an equally long hiking route.
In good conditions it is able to cover a bit more distance than walking - but very little of it has the speed of cross country skiing without heavy backpacks on prepared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to several countries means going through visa applications and passport controls many times.
However, the Schengen Zone acts somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in these areas, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what constitutes a manufactured item to be antique; some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as an antique.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where age limits may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as primitive goods, although they are smaller than similar mass-produced goods.
Barbarism is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding trade is important to many along with other occupations.

Today many Sami people work in modern trades.Tourism is an important income in the Sami region of Sapmi.
Although still widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the term "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, US citizens in the Middle East may face a situation different from that of Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The ideas presented are often superficial, general, and more simple than the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and can take many different forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.

Preoperative transgender people should not expect to pass the scanner while retaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents returning from waves breaking from the shore, often a rock or similar body of water.
Due to the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated in a few deep segments, and can form a fast current in deeper water.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion in trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than it used to be.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skill and who you've been spotted with, you may want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock may occur earlier than culture shock (it has shorter honeymoon times), last longer than winter, and can have a greater impact.

When we return from living abroad we adapt to new cultures, and we lose some of our habits and our home culture.
When one first visited a foreign country, he or she was likely to be patient and discreet, as he or she was aware that many changes were required to make the traveler comfortable in a new country.
People consciously thought that even the returning traveler needed patience and understanding.
The pyramid is one of the most interesting things about this area for those who like the sound and light show.
All the pyramids are now visible in the dark and can only be viewed in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the voices of tourists and vendors here.The story of sound and light is exactly like that of the story book.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramid and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and are the most numerous of the group, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.King George Island is the largest with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Cheos where a still active volcanic flood caldera provides a spectacular natural harbor.

The northern part or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, at 4892 m Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option available to you.
A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that require nearby remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information to parties connected to this service.
An increasingly popular option for gap year planners is to travel and learn.
It is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to leave the university a year early without compromising on their education.

There will generally be a tuition fee for enrollment in these academic programs.
Finland is a great boating destination, with thousands of islands even in the lakes and coastal archipelago in the "Land of a Thousand Lakes".
Islands and lakes do not need their own boats.
Although the coastal archipelago and largest lakes are in fact large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but larger and more beautiful (for example the figure one to forty in the Netherlands is the Agora).
Most typical Baltic cruises facilitate an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can return to the ship at night and comfortably visit the historic city for two full days.
If you go ashore using only a shipboard excursion, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany.As you can see from the map above of Berlin there are no places near the sea and visits to the city are not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
This is not to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of many people for other things.
For some, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during flight may help to allay fears that are based on the unknown or out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly; often, timing is very important with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for immediate repairs.
On some routes large companies have their own planes, but other routes and smaller firms have problems.
If they were shipping goods by air freight, they would take certain routes and could take days to get through customs.
The only way to get there quickly was to send it as checked baggage.Airline rules do not allow baggage to be sent to passengers without them knowing where you are now.
Getting on a plane in first or business class often required paying good money, in order to gain some of the advantages of private travel (it would have been even better if the ticket was booked by your company).
Although it is quite expensive, a typical person would pay four times the normal fare for business and eleven times for first class, if they were to be told the average price.
It generally makes no sense to look for discounts for a business or first-class seat on a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that a group of passengers can pay a flat-rate fare for a comfortable journey anywhere, and so they charge the same fare to everyone.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau.The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.

Apart from Agora in the north visit the Great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (the shrine), the site of the world-famous Marian apparition.
Please remember that we are essentially visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site that has almost incalculable meaning to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who lived here to their time, and many more whose loved ones were killed or worked there to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Do not make fun of the Holocaust or the Nazi party.
Do not mar the site by scratching or marking in the composition of the graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.About half the people prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understands the Agora, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.

Plitvice Lakes National Park is predominantly heavily forested with beech, spruce and cedar trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
Due to a microclimate, different soils and different levels of elevation, it has a wide diversity of plant communities.

Rare creatures such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and saphira can be found there along with many more common species.
When visiting a monastery, women wear a skirt that covers the knees and has their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide cover for women who come unprepared, but if you find your own, especially with bright colours, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along those lines, men are required to wear trousers covering the knees.
These can be borrowed from stock at the entrance but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majercan cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mainly pork), and uses whole olive oil.

Pre-modern observatories are generally now obsolete, and remain as museums, or places of learning.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their golden days as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are easier than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the pear blossom was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom party was held by the emperor for himself only and for other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.

Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky remains more or less dark for twenty-four hours.
Since the area is sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, one can enjoy the stars here.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are the standard business attire, and co-workers tend to call one another by their family name or job title.
Workplace harmony is important, with an emphasis on collective effort rather than celebrating individual achievement.
