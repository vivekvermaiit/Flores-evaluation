While there appears to be one experimental vaccine capable of reducing Ebola deaths, so far, no drugs have been proven suitable for treating the existing infections.
One of the antibody cocktails, ZMapp, was initially promising in this field, but official studies indicated that the benefits of this cocktail were less than the intended benefits in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as the control standard, meaning that scientists set it as the baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's message and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the U.S. Olympic Committee's statement that the interests of athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by advancing meaningful change within our organization, rather than withdrawing licenses.

Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory already, but it also provides details that fossils generally can't, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were brownish-brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery also gives a glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed axis, called the "flash axis", but have other features of the feathers - such as cones and microtubes - the researchers concluded that the flash axis was likely a later evolutionary outgrowth of these other features.
The wing structure suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this tail belongs to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not a chicken's butt.
The researchers noted that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird feathers and not chickens' feathers.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

And the work was done mostly theoretically, but the software was written to simulate observations of the Milky Way.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by radical tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes tides, the Milky Way attracts the Milky Way.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that natural matter does.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a halo-like form, made up of small particles in large numbers.

Their thermal behavior is not as constant as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experiment: voters insulate themselves in a polling booth, and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the envelope is placed in the ballot box and signed on the voters' list.
The French electoral law regulates the procedure unfavourably strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the start of voting, and that only envelopes of registered voters and duly authorized by them and their commissioners are added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under intensive supervision following a specific procedure.

Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
But the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services have released the driver of a red Audi TT.
He had been initially admitted to James Baggett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness could be questionable because her photo has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered that the publication of the images could potentially be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it seems to me that journalists are certainly going in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or similar of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that there will be no further comment until at least after the indictment.
The document will, according to the leak, refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 war borders in the Middle East.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is an important issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a 10-year military presence in Ghor, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a five-year one.
The guards had to closely supervise the shooters in the supplemental pest control trial, as the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were selected for the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt have received extensive safety guidance and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday to a new nine-member provisional electoral council.
This is the fifth interim election for Martelli in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was in place as Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, have erupted over the failure to hold elections scheduled for 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod temperature malfunctions have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving hardware.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of wear and tear, which the company called "non-serious".
The department responded to Apple's call to delay the report as "really unfortunate".
The quake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (Friday 09:19 p.m. GMT) and was followed by a second earthquake at the same time.
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office has stated that no damage has been reported in the county.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no indications of a potential tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken two Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and elderly people, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Leggins followed in his father's footsteps and took medicine as his profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and then began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Leggins began investigating preterm births in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His research has shown that when given a hormone, it accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, or what is known as the "black box", on Wednesday.
As fellow wrestlers praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Lona was the first radical queen. My first boss, Luna, died on the night of the new moon. A strong, unique woman".
Dustin "Goldst" Runnels commented, "Luna was as eccentric as I am... and maybe more so than I am... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Among 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the percentage opposing Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree with this view, and want Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
In contrast, 29% of those polled thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist's fitness was called into question by his complaint, as he was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take the pain medication because it's forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people were investigating the discovery using different hardware and software as of early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth has formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political and ridiculous gossip".
He's likely to run for president in 2016.
Nexigen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-linked technology as opposed to the older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of an aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more specific information.
There is no additional transport and no underground trains will stop at Wembley, as well as no car parks, parking facilities and on-ground riding.
Concerns over lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the match may be forced to be held behind closed doors, without the presence of the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although it was thought to take much longer - because of interbreeding between the Darwin's finch, the mid-sized groundhog, the migratory cactus, and the sharp-nosed groundhog.
Gold can be shaped into many shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
And it can be pulled into a thin wire, it can be rolled up and removed, it can be polished or rolled into sheets.
It could be made so thin, and then glued onto another metal, and it could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the chemical's pH number, and you can make an index of that number using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The level of hydrogen acids is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are electron-deprived protons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Turn the dry powders together and then shake them with clean, wet hands until they are ball-shaped.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a toilet with a drainage system in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in homes in Minoan, Crete, and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would go together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The space satellite picks up the call and then reflects it back at roughly the same time.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere of the planet distorts some of the light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world dramatically, but it's still providing a faster and easier means of transportation that's been most important to us.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
In a row below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the smaller prey that are more numerous such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called packs.
A lion family consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and lions.
Females are usually closer together, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The black pride acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, the animals are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are very deadly to their prey.
As a complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the tiger, and the Uighur, and these four are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not a full-blown lion's roar, but it is more like the roar of angry words.
The pygmy leopard prefers to eat small animals. It will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can. Almost all the animals the pygmy leopard hunts are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the primate tracks and finds prey by its sense of smell; it can smell where it has been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main group of populations to which they belong (for example if they move across a mountain range or a river, or they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will find themselves, often, in a different environment from the one they were in before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group will need different attributes or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than it previously needed to be.
The indigenous people haven't changed at all, they still need the same adaptation methods that we gave them.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they gradually become less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look so different that we can't even call them the same species.
We call this process the process of speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is from plants, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 years old, blade-like teeth plus another set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish and other mussels, and it may have been carnivorous.
It also attacked everything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not match it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of exotic or unusual holiday items, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a louse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on benches, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they leaned on their side while they ate their homework.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included the foods that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods and it was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods during festivals and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard leading to a safe recess that only priests could enter.
Sometimes unique pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, home didn't mean much.
Most of the Hebrew family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open countertops overlooking the street; stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was expensive.
In the Norse epics, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes once lived there.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of the countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, even though each country was Scandinavian.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although the author of this portion of the text is not known for certain, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was originally a folded shelf.
So, it's likely that the code was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
Vichy France was ruled by Vichy France, these are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French troops liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work in a cooperative, community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, which is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and this also defines the way a social mass is.
Self-governing cities are the ancestors of nations. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Microcultures often disappear without leaving any real historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole element - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any authority to tax, and because it had no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, it has no authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended and the states so derided the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to - from a geographical perspective - as an "archipelago".
Taiwan began to make a comeback in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as lha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, the Qing government signed an aide to Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings, the Intihuana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 millimeters, the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio has inherited from it the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm model is actually, a little bit confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this picture is (when divided by 12 to get the ratio to the simplest integer) so it's going to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the Advanced Image System suite of formats, for example) have this width-to-height ratio or close to it.
The misused and often derided triangle rule is a simple guiding principle that creates dynamics while maintaining some degree of order in the visual.
The most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European nations together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The overwhelming power she wielded affected everyone from the king to the common people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's cash funds exist specifically for this reason.
The church in Rome had been the central authority for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question the extent to which the requirements of the creed were met.
Britain soon began to encircle Germany by sea after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violates generally accepted international law, codified and coordinated in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain had blocked international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, threatening even neutral shipping.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were one of peace and isolation.
After seeing the horrors of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid that situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each dynasty in power was of a different kind.
In addition, there was an unstable era of divided provinces between each ruling dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war arose between many nobles seeking the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era is one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the top seats in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just the ruler.
Also, after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for the military because instead of being based on class, military classifications are now based on rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to unleash their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this earthly life. He used to frequent the Ghar, now known as Hara, on the Mount of Light for meditation.
The gar itself, which has survived through the ages, presents a very vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
And in fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it's there, because once you're in the cave, you're completely isolated.
And nothing can be seen but the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era, the Great Pyramid is one of the huge pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "City of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Great Pyramid.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up" sign looks like a V, and the "down" sign looks like a truss or a square without a bottom.
A high sign means you should start at the end and push the bow, while a low sign means you should start at the end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and more firm.
Feel free to draw your own markings in pencil, but remember that printed curved markings exist for a musical reason, so they should be generally respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Thérèse, 11, and Louis Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a huge crowd of people shouting and cheering against the king and queen.
A group of mobs managed to force the king and queen to open their car windows on their hands.
A member of the gang once waved the head of one of the royal guards killed at Versailles in front of the panicked queen.
The Filipino people are paying the price of the US imperialist war in its invasion of the Philippines.
These had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will be the main gains of US imperialism.
We need to understand the context of the organization's creation, to understand the Templars.
The era in which these events took place was known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which in their entirety ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the drive for technology or technological necessity to the rigid sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two general ideas that are common to most explanations of technological determinism: that the evolution of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on the communities it is embedded in, rather than connected to the community.
For example, one might say that the car engine necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But building a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which leads to the development of new technologies in health care to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism derived from writers like Goethe, Vesch and Schlegel.
In the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, as in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed rules.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its decline during the 12th century was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were of higher value than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that Paris, rather than Constantinople, was named the fashion capital.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of the slowness of the communication channels, the patterns in the West may be as much as 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time was as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
A subsistence farming system uses preserved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields. It is a simple, often organic system.
Most farmers have, historically, worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures reconcile like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, race, class, location and/or gender of members.
The traits that define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership through a different and symbolic use of style that includes clothing, costumes, and terminology.
Among the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of social upbringing is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who have suffered, through neglect, bad luck or intentional abuse, social disconnection from adults during their upbringing.
Some lost children have been locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability, and these children are called "savages".
Savage children may have been abused in childhood or severely traumatized before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by nonhuman animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that are very similar to those of a pet, such as fear of humans or indifference to them.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather a supporting tool that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and real, and in other words, a teacher is a form of interactive learning, and so is the paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported internally in the program and is designed to ask questions, motivate and explain actions that a student may find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse, to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that doesn't have nurturing, care and education, but they do.
We recognize that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The surrogate care has to provide all the necessities they missed in the homes they left.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and ways of fulfillment.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "social literacy" as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting the subtle expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper that the president's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that these abilities to analyze human behavior are shared with some animals, like pet dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two groups of Chinese varieties: a latent group and a genetically expressed group.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressive variations.
The process of separation and recombination randomly sends variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have a hard time meeting their requirements for amino acids from available plant resources.
Failure to do so can have dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
And the most easily accessible plant resources were proteins that you could get from leaves and pulses, but those proteins are hard for primates to digest unless they're cooked like us.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high amounts of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved their protein problem in some way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and going to sleep a short time later (10 to 60 minutes).
And this can be done quite easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to stop it.
Other options, based on biosystems, include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positivity that life force gives. Everyone has the inherent ability to find peace and contentment.
The only thing that's holding us back from that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was extended through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, and it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces everyone.
The energy of Kundalini is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chanting and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the god Yuga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakra is activated, and consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, but with the end of the war, the clash of systems, procedures and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and it was to be fought on the ground, by proxy armies, in theaters of war from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman Bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Tradition has it that the job of the Navy is to ensure your country's ability to move your people and its goods, while at the same time, intercepting your enemy's ability to move his people and his goods.
One of the most noteworthy modern examples is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport personnel and material across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Dairy goats were generally raised in herds roaming the hills or other grazing areas, often herded by goat herders who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the widely known shepherd. These grazing methods are still in use today.
Carriage roads were created in England as far back as the 16th century.
Although the early railway carriages were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull greater loads than the roads that were considered more rugged at the time.
Railroad poles were invented relatively early to fix tracks, but it later turned out that over time, putting a steel bar on top of the track made it more efficient.
This became the norm, but the iron led to more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-size iron bars were introduced.
Walking was the first form of transportation, and humans started walking erectly two million years ago, coinciding with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in a steady manner.
Two-legged species have been found in the fossil record of the Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahylanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be proactive in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is just like treating the symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to end it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed so much because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become even greater because of the increase in population and man's luxurious lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
And overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Cash Notes".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The Dunlap Twenty-five Scrolls represent the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have balanced feet and claws, and they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like dinosaurs.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, if we use the terminology of computing.
Intravenous intoxication may not show its effects immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as vomiting, which are sufficiently general, appear.
The best indicator of indoor poisoning may be an open container of toxic medication or household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to intrude on humans.
Both killer and bed bugs have a long incubation period and are adapted to living in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the most common neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that females are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through a scientific method, and this method actually guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only way to test one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are critically dependent on the existence of self-cycles and produced by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclic signals, have been documented for most organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Our biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue for periods of consecutive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses or viruses to insert their DNA into the germs.
They did two experiments to label either the DNA of the nucleotides using radioactive phosphorus or their protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are from the stem cell line.
Mutations in germline cells can only be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting and photographing and learning about the Bornean man of the jungle.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to their workplaces and are met on the way by other workers at the place they just left.
In this vibrant transportation, everyone is somehow supported through a transportation system that is based on private cars and connects through them.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Everyone complains about the transportation system.
You rarely hear similar levels of complaints in developed countries about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic studies are difficult because you can't predict the behavior of a driver with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range, so traffic has a reasonably consistent pattern, which can be expressed mathematically by approximation.
To better illustrate the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings back along the length of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are the dragonfly and the Mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many people thought otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, at times up to six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were not surpassed in size and technical excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the relics of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most state employees, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All the people of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper has been known since ancient times, as all these elements can be discovered in nature in their original form and can be extracted in a relatively easy way using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle postulated that everything was made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also assumed that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals. And there are of course metals like silver and gold as well.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the space of the dot at the end of this sentence.
And then, the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the pencil was relegated to a lesser role and uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without the need to use the game.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works by gathering energy to form a nucleus full of protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, the core breaks back and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no perturbation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under Maria and thicker under the Highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is less thick, and it was easier for the lava to come up to the surface.
Content theories are about finding what excites or draws people in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that manifest spontaneously when they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want to do the things they do and the things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's second factor theory.
In general, behaviour can emerge when managers start to lead their former peers. One is trying to stay "like the others".
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
And on the other end, the individual becomes an unrecognizable person who feels that he/she has to change everything that the team has and has done.
Because in the end, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to friction between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
They often have greater independence than traditional team members as their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real "secret team" has been described by Larson and LaVasto, 1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the Invisible Team management team, where the Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to create an educational organization when it's a time-consuming process?
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments in an organization, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
As a result, synergy within the organization to overcome obstacles can result in new innovative procedures that meet customer needs.
Before an organization is able to innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the continuity method as a methodology used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The data associated with neuroscience provides concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to knowledge inquiry, thereby narrowing the area of research and making it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies is allowing us to see the structure and processes of the brain and to research it in ways that have never been done before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulations that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence involves making machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior automatically.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Things like this have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been used to build several software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher may like to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology allows the solution through virtual field visits. Students can view the museum artifacts, visit the aquarium or enjoy the beautiful art while their classmates sit in line.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to recall a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience changes that in general.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to seek to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "force students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be smart and useful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; through effective response to online material, students can identify their positions in the context of others' writing as well as their own opinions on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital with a collection of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is in the far south, and in the north lies the beautiful, untapped nature home of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered to be the Canadian essence by outsiders.
Large areas in the north are relatively sparsely populated and some almost uninhabited.
To compare a demographic that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island on the planet, and it's an independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it has spread widely in the Comoros and Maui.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the African coast, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Regardless of actual social status, women travelers should declare that they are married.
It's a good idea to wear a ring, but not the one that looks so expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they may consider harassment and that it is common to be spotted, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't make it okay!).
The Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Nava" after its founding by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Darou Labadia, and Spanish merchants named it Casablanca who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as chickens, pottery, leather goods, sheaves and all colors of cheap goods, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, which flooded most of the city streets, and the city center in particular.
Any visits outside Goma should be sought to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, while Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can ride a Buda Buda (a motorcycle that acts as a taxi) to get around Goma, and the usual price (locally) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Besides being relatively inaccessible, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for distant foreign lands.
Timbuktu is now a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates in his PBS series on the wonders of the world in Africa.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park is 19,500 square kilometers in size and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in South Africa and is the main national park in South Africa (South African National Parks).
There is a daily fee for maintenance and entry, as in all South African national parks.
It may be useful to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to enter a select group of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place where many tourists consider their kiss.
The row of buildings that line Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glittering diagram that appears over the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated heavily on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is where the British colonists took their place, so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of conifers in the world, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 mi) in the remote coastal areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last evidence of the dense scrub that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres, of which about a third is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart the inter-district (across the river) inland station during the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakkar/Pomthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses within the regions are often full, it is better to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable, and powerful Japanese coaster buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Barrow (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Ouyaboc River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Ouyaboc River to connect the cities of Ouyaboc in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-Louyaboc in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long, and have two 3.50 metres wide corridors.
The free vertical distance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to begin operating at full capacity in September 2017, at the same time as the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. The Guaraní lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", arose as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year is held in December, on the polo grounds of Las Canitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and inside Stanley credit cards and the United States dollar are often.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so the money must be exchanged before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures in the summer months often exceed 30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and moisture combine to make the atmosphere colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year, with no defined "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
And according to park authorities, stay away from bears and wolves at least 100 yards per meter, and from all other wildlife 25 yards per meter!
As docile as they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost every other large animal will attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year for not keeping a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and very dangerous and that's why you should stay away from them.
Additionally, be careful because the smells are attractive to bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser and nearly 200 American and German personnel.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of the supreme leader, Tupua Samis Lilofi III.
As a result of Auckland's location between two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular of which is located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor region) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy allowing safe swimming, and most are shaded by botox trees.
Tamaki Roads Beach is located on Whitimata Harbour, on the outskirts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good range of shops lining the beach.
The main popular beer is known as "Number One", it is not a complex drink, but a fun and refreshing drink. The other local beer is called "Manta".
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines may have a wider distribution.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're nervous.
For Australians, the idea of flat white coffee is a strange one. Small black coffee is espresso, cappuccino is mostly cream (not foam) piled on top, and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent although they are expensive.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and damage to the reefs rarely occurs for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. It can occasionally be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles don't normally live in the ocean, their primary habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking assures the traveller that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Although you may find that it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
It has become common for travel agents to offer packages including breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or even combined packages including flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to buy other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made first through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site as an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you have to get in early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may be over, some sections of the festival may continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, you should check the cabin location, as crossing the ice causes extremely loud noise for the most affected people.
Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to increase the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood, and keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness hinders good judgment and teaches all good gamblers the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive as if you were driving on soft asphalt.
And during a blizzard, enough snow may fall to stop you for a very short time.
Snowfall, hailstorms, condensation, or ice on car windows can cause limited visibility.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari tours are perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the most important activity for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to cross-country travel to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, leopards, and tigers are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush safari, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwal, bushwalk, bushwal, bushwal, bushwal
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
After Tokyo hosted the 1964 Olympic Games, it will become the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a bind.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not in place until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with a typical regular price of around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels provide a stove and a kitchen table for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no air dryer, or if you do not prefer to wear socks with air dryer, then you can try using an air dryer, if available.
Do not make the cloth too hot (which may cause it to shrink or burn in the worst case).
There are different ways to purify water, some more useful against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, and in other areas, you need to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers are likely to encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infection.
The very infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can forcibly infect or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
Shopping in the free market is an opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and duties in designated places.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it regularly passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is more important than otherwise.
Strange, though, because cell service is stronger here than in many other places along the way, like the Pennsylvania woods.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apples being cooked in the pies all year round while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Germans often eat the popular buns with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small, rich pastries, try something called a Berliner, a vanquokken or a krabfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A curry spring can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes, while in southern India and some other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines spread around Indonesia, given that there are 17,000 islands in Indonesia to differentiate between them.
But if used without additional terms, the term tends to mean that the food originated in the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simply spicy dishes, the main flavours preferred by Javanese are peanut, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The crutches are the supports for the rider's feet, which rest on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but his foot is caught in the harness, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce that risk.
First, most fantasy characters wear riding boots with heels and very tight, soft slippers.
Second, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the passenger's fur to fall off the saddle when pulled back when the passenger gets off.
Cusamo Valley - the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of walls and large granite rocks.

Slope sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a skateboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity and has a large number of enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski homeless", who plan to spend a full-time vacation centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
The history of downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called skiing in uninhabited areas, skiing trips or ice hiking.
It is associated with alpine skiing or mountaineering, but does not usually involve snowboarding or mountaineering, as they are practiced on heavily sloped terrain and require harder skis and longer shoes.
Think of a ski trail as a similar trail to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking, but you'll rarely reach long-distance skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and on equipped trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means you have to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area acts somewhat like one country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to go through the traveler's checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for entry visas for each of the Schengen member countries individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are over a hundred years old, but there's no universal definition of what we consider an artifact of manufactured items.
The definition varies geographically, where the life expectancy may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products may be identified as antiques even though they are more recent than similar goods that were mass produced in the distant past.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Samis, and the culture surrounding trade is also important to many other occupations.
Even traditionally, though, not all Sami people engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they did live off fishing, hunting and the like, and used reindeer mostly as draught animals.
Many Sami people today work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Sapmi.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, it is considered an offensive word because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.

Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather events in the places they visit as this may affect their travel plans.
And anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should get some vocational training.
An online search for "hostile environment course" might lead to a local business address.
The course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much greater detail and is usually through practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports without a gender X or to issue updated documents to fit a desired gender name or gender type.
Foreign governments vary widely in their willingness to respect these documents.
And security checkpoint searches have become much more invasive of privacy in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people should not expect to go through the scans before surgery while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Drag currents are the backflow of waves that cut across the shore, often at a reef or something.
Due to the underwater terrain, the backflow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current may form into the deep water there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from trying to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back is as easy as ever.
Try to target a place where you're not being held back by the current again or, depending on your skills and whether anyone notices your presence, waiting for rescue may be another option.
Homecoming trauma occurs faster than cultural shock (shortening the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Sometimes travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture have a particularly difficult time re-adapting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When I first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
What people might not expect is that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most fun things to do in the area for kids.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the performance begins.

The viewer is shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by several countries, have the most bases, with 16 active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other places include Livingston Island, and Despair, where the caldera, which is overrun by a still-active volcano, provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost part of the peninsula, bounded by the Blinghausen Sea.
The peninsula mountains here merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Range, which stretches 360 km, and is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif with its peak being the 4892 m equivalent of Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you must be outside in clear line of sight with the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as exploratory missions that have remote data and voice needs.
There must be a local telephone service provider who can provide further information on how to contact the service.
Travel and learning is a more common option for those planning a gap year.
It's especially popular among school leavers, as it allows them to spend a year before going to university, without risking their education.
Often, enrolling in a one-year training course abroad can improve your chances of getting into higher education in your home country when you return.
There is usually a fee for enrolling in these programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is quite unique (for example in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most premium Baltic cruises feature a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days on the way back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you are travelling on a coastal cruise, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some tours feature the German city of Berlin in the brochures; as you can see from the map above, Berlin is not a place near the sea and the price of the trip does not include a visit to the city.

Understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during flight may help some to overcome the fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Good money is paid to shipping companies to deliver things quickly. Time is usually very important with regard to work documents, goods and spare parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies had their own planes, on some lines, but there was a problem for other lines and smaller companies.
If they're shipping things by air freight, it might take a few days at some routes for unloading and customs.
Sending the package as checked baggage was the only way to get it back quickly, but the internal rules of the airlines don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so it's your turn at this point.
The obvious way to travel first or business class is to allocate a large sum of money to get that privilege (or better yet, to charge your company to do so).
However, this does not come cheap: as a strict rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for business, and eleven times for first class!
In general, it's no use looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are charged accordingly.
The local language is Romanian but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994 this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.

Further north, you can visit the shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, the site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially at a mass grave site, and it is a site that has almost infinite meaning for a huge portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many other people who had loved ones killed or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, respect and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by placing scratch marks or writing on the walls of buildings.
The city of Barcelona has two official languages, Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are expressed in Catalan, as it is by law the first official language.

The Plyvic Lakes National Park is filled with dense forests, mainly pine, spruce and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
It has a large and diverse range of plant communities, due to the range of local climates, different soil types, and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to a very diverse assortment of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and turkey can be found there, along with many other more common species.
While visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover both knees and their shoulders, as well.
Most monasteries provide blankets for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially the brightly colored ones, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover both knees.
These can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like the rest of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in all things.

While light pollution wasn't as big a problem as it is today, they're more commonly found in cities or on college campuses and are more accessible than that building in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with the right atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing - known as hanami - has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were most common.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom parties exclusively for himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial court.

Many traditions surrounding the holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of staying up all night until the end of Easter in an open place to watch the sunrise.
This tradition can certainly be explained from a Christian theological point of view, but there is a possibility that it was a religious ritual of spring and fertility from pre-Christian times.
The more traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil on the Saturday during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin celebrating the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally reached the islands came either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you decide to visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to observe the aurora borealis, where the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is probably not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy stargazing.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are the traditional work clothes, and co-workers call each other by their family names or by job titles.
And harmony in the workplace is critical, as it emphasizes team effort over individual achievement.
