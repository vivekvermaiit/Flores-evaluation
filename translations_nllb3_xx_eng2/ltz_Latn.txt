This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were coastal brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft (called a spindle), but had other features of feathers - beards and rays - researchers concluded that the spindle was likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for temperature control or appearance. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen is from adult feathers and not from the plumes of a jumping spider.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample came from adult feathers and not from the plumes of a jumping spider.

The luminous intensity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star that is in contact with the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a force of gravity on the earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory suggests that most dark matter is in a halo around a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

This extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their candidacy in an envelope.
After officials check the voter's identity, the voter removes the envelope and ballot box and signs on the voter list.
French electoral law codifies the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly elected and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see every part of the process. In the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision according to specific procedures.

Adekoya was charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any testimony could be taken into account as her photo was widely published.
This is common in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for criminal prosecution overall, told reporters that it would not comment further until the indictment.
The document refers to the disputed border area claimed by Palestine based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War, according to the leak.
Other allegedly covered topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years as soon as an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority wants to allow this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control study should be closely monitored by rangers as the study was monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director of parks and heritage for the NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service), the four selected shooters for the first shooting incident received extensive safety and training.
Martelly swore in a new provisional executive council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure of elections, which have been partially postponed since 2011.
There have been about 60 cases of overheating of iPods, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that one in 27 accidents was related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional heating incidents that the company described as "non-threatening".
The ministry reacted to Apple's criticism of the report, calling it "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday 9:19 a.m. GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported across the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourist.
Some hostages were rescued and at least six were confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an older dam that had to be towed to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to examine premature babies in his spare time.
His research showed that when a hormone was abused, it would accelerate the fetal lung depletion of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid their last respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna left on the night of the two moons of us. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as I am...maybe even a little more so...I love her and miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 respondents to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of survey respondents share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his plainness his fitness was questioned.
He was unable to take medication to overcome his pain, as they are prohibited during the game.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people were verifying the discovery using various hardware until early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supplies to Earth, along with organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the Earth, because comets have collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year at age 53 and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and stupidity".
He is speculated to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of tons of fuel and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional means of transport deployed and overflow trains do not stop at Wembley and parking lots and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of the possibility of a possible transportation problem have raised the possibility that the game could be held behind closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published Thursday in Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian GalÃ¡pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process likely took much longer due to the encounter between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be made into thin wire that can be crushed and torn. It can be coated with a lobster and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and pasted onto other metals, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures and books, called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (the H in the pH value) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which fall off roughly and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a suspended overhead water system.
Relics of underwater systems have been found in the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and the Romans sometimes used them as part of public baths, where men and women met in mixed societies.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light in the sky.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet [30 m] high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in ways that are indescribable, and the biggest advantage we have with the wheel is that it's much faster and easier to transport.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbit ears to antelopes and red wolves.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat the much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and worms.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task that everyone has, which keeps them from competing with others.
Cats are solitary creatures that live in large groups, called packs.
A pack consists of one to four adult males, along with up to thirty females and males.
The females are usually closely related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lionesses behave similarly to wolves and dogs. Animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap far and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can bark.
The tiger's cry is not like the full-voiced cry of a lion, but rather like a phrase of spoken words.
Ocelots eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, reptiles, and birds, and almost all animals that the ocelot eats are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals for food (catch) by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They see well in the dark and move well with night vision. They make their victims by observing their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (such as when they move over a mountain or a river, or when they move to a new island and thus cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were previously.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
By the time the new population has adapted to its new environment, it begins to outnumber the other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can never be called the same species.
We call this process "genetization", which is just the formation of a new species. Genetization is an inevitable form and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes and produce our food from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
The mosasaur was the largest predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set of teeth on the gum, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a split tongue, its diet included sea cucumbers, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't keep up with it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had some very strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, pork, slugs, and a type of rodent called the sleeping mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women sat on the floor and ate, the rich men liked to put banquets together where they could eat on the side.
Meals in Ancient Rome could not include foods that came to Europe in later centuries from the Americas or Asia.
They had, for example, no more corn, no more tomatoes, no more potatoes, no more cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate noodle fish.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, specific pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden, shops were just open fountains on the street, and stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, as he travelled further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences in the people, kings, kingdoms and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Templar Legacy", you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a note on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text is found at the bottom of the reversed document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (it measures 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up early in its life for storage.
So it's likely that the property was simply added as a description.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and annexed it to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, cognate to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also in some ways determines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a continuous cultural footprint, and an orderly diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation first formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to raise taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on government agencies, often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
It also had no power to suspend tax laws and excise duties between states.
The clauses required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government to task, so their representatives were often dismissive.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after Germany, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor sports.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipel" in geographical terms.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing along recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation of the core production of the indigenous and employed Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and Taiwan was declared a province of Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like before.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
The most commonly used format for still photographs worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio has been largely replaced by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually, what you might call a little bit more portable, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is referred to here as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format family) match or approximate this aspect ratio.
The much abused and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
She realised that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For a thousand years, Christianity held European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Her all-pervading power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this basic principle has been fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective in cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law, codified by multiple international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from navigating entire sections of the ocean, which has put even neutral ships at risk.
Since there was only a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a corresponding response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, the nations resolved to prevent a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of designating different eras: each phase of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an uncertain period of divided provinces. The most famous of these eras was the 'Three Kingdoms' epoch, which lasted 60 years and was between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not just one ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to take it.
The same goes for the military, because instead of army lists based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also encouraged other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things outside of this worldly life, and he would frequently visit a cave known as 'Hira' on Mount 'Noor' (Light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the centuries, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on a hill north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you knew it existed.
There is only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains to be seen. If one is in the cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Cheops and each of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were erected to honor the wives and family members of Cheops.
The "top-side" tree looks like a V and the "bottom-side" tree looks like a bracket or square with no underside.
Top means you start at the top and press down on the ball and bottom means you start at the mill (where your hand is holding the ball) and press down on the ball.
A rising tone usually generates a lower pitch, while a falling tone is stronger and more definitive.
Do not hesitate to draw your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed tree markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be kept as normal.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Ã‰lisabeth, were forced back to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a mob of merchants from Versailles.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who were shouting and shouting against the king and queen.
The mob of people forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a mob member held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, so a large part of the spending and interest on the bonds was paid by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits that result from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the underlying motives of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices; from the technology-push or technological necessity to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamentally guiding logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, however, so new production methods are being developed to reduce costs for vehicle owners.
Mass motorization also leads to a higher accident rate on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare field for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, bridges and cultures emerged that were connected to this geography, and that were, because they were in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th to 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the Byzantine culture in the East had a very strong influence on Gezi.
However, the styles in the West may be lagging behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten the cross.
Subsistence farming is farming that is conducted for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological system that combines ecoregional sowing with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, and they allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be indistinguishable by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style usage that includes fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods of questioning the meaning of socialization is to look at some fortunate cases of children who were not socialized by neglect, bad luck, or excessive abuse by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "wild". Some wild children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this task has been the child's response to the rejection of severe mental or physical abuse by the parents.
Teenage runaways may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others should be eaten by animals; others should live alone in the wilderness.
When raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost entirely those of the animal's parent, such as fear of or respect for humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but an aid that supports people who are doing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a schoolmaster is a form of scaffolding, but this also applies to the small office clerk in Microsoft Office.
Virtual noises are embedded in the software and are intended to ask, request and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are given away for cheap in foster care, which ranges from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not supportive, social and educational, but it is now.
We see the health care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our care system should provide a safe home, nurses who have a very warm manner, a stable education and a reliable health care.
The nursing home should provide all necessities needed in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and reward.
Thus, for example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are considered important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal commitment' and 'persistent relationships' were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they studied audience responses on Internet sites.
The use of video recordings has led to relevant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions  facial movements of a few milliseconds .
First of all, it is claimed that one can recognize if a person is suffering by correctly interpreting a microexpression.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech because of hearing impairments are almost able to judge sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twenty-first century research has shown that there are two pools of exact variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination move the variation with each generation between the two poles back and forth.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
And there are serious consequences if you don't: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been proteins and leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (seafood, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a wealth of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors had solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the process of purposefully waking up during the normal sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10  60 minutes later).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively slow alarm clock to bring you to consciousness but not fully awaken you.
If you put the watch back on while sleeping, it can be placed on the other side of the room in case you are forced to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force exists. Every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own negativity and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is Guruyoga, where by visualizing various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to a collaboration between the USSR and the United States. By the end of the war, the confluence of systems, processes and cultures led to the breakdown of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies developed into enemies, which led to the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought in earnest by the proxies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and scattered other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were thwarted almost overnight, however, when 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union marched into the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's task has traditionally been to ensure that its country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the ability of its enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to support the British.
At the same time, the German Navy tried, mainly with submarines, to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain and the rest of Europe.
Geese were apparently first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples kept them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
House meals were held in the stairs, which were moved to hills or other pastures, often tended by ghost horses, which were often children and youths, rather than as the far-known places. This method of herding is still used today.
Dunes were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the dunes were mainly composed of parallel wooden dunes, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and with larger loads than on the lighter gravel roads of the time.
Rail sleepers were introduced early on to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually found that the rails were more efficient if they had an iron stock on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear to the wooden wheels of the vines.
Eventually, wooden rails were replaced by iron rails. In 1767 the first full-sized railways were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking; humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecus, did not walk upright as they usually do.
Doubtful specializations are found in fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join an environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and we should address it.
It is obvious that mankind's scientific and technological advances have dramatically changed the world and that problems have been exacerbated by human overpopulation and excessive lifestyles.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few pages further to John Dunlap's printing press.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap Flea Leaves, which we know to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The handwritten original copy has not survived.
Today, paleontologists are convinced that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are considered to be binary digits  or bits (to use computer language).
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of a domestic poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
The label contains specific first-aid instructions for each poison.
The term "chewerleaf" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and insects are nest-hockers, adapting to life in the nest or the dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their baby.
Adoption is the process whereby the birth parents relinquish parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to explain how the world works through the scientific method, and this method definitely drives most of the scientific research.
However, it does not do this alone, experimenting  and an experiment is a test used to test one or more of the possible hypotheses  asking questions and making observations are also part of the conduct of scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Similarly in physiology and behavior observed rhythms often depend crucially on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to run for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, either marking the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit nature reserves to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to drive to their workplace and drive past those whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the last 2 million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transport systems generate these kinds of complaints, why do they disappear every day? Are transportation planners just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the investigation of traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave in a uniformly consistent area; here traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were drawn between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, water jumping and daylighting insects alone cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but others thought the opposite; that the solar system would revolve around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on earth, at some points being just over 6 miles [9.7 km] wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical performance of the construction of the Pyramids of Giseh were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Already in antiquity, humans knew basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they can all be discovered in nature in natural form and can be mined with primitive stories relatively easily.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four aggregate states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma; although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so surreally small that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of new writing methods, the pencil has become less important and used.
People are now writing messages on computer screens and don't need a pen anymore.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus of cells with many protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy wound, a bullet is rolled up, and the nucleus splits again, releasing some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they break apart with little or no damage.
The lunar surface is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the mantle.
The coast is about 70 km on the upstream side and about 100 km on the downstream side.
It is thinner under the marshes and thicker over the highlands.
There may be more mares on the exposed side because the lava is thinner, and it was easier for lava to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out how people are ticking or what they're saying.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that were suppressed as they entered adulthood.
This theory considers what it is about certain people wanting the things they want, and what things in their environment lead them to want certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, there are two types of behavior that can arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues: One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the colleagues".
This type of leadership has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibility and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable person who feels like they have to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a liaison to their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to the corresponding time zones, which is not necessarily understood by the local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each individual member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively deployed in the functional areas of an enterprise, creativity and resourcefulness can be expressed.
Here, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
For an organisation to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) defines continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us valuable information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI is a very important area of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, but are also embedded in many home computer and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every classroom, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual excursions, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire wonderful art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is updated annually, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a collector's item.
Blogging can also help improve student writing, and while students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, attending an audience changes that in general.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become more familiar with the world around them". The need to capture the interest of the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
A moderate use of blogging "may enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of comments by others and also emphasize their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is dotted with a plethora of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south lie Niagara Falls and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more elevate Ontario beyond what is considered typical Canadian by foreigners.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To compare the population, which surprises many, there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in terms of flora and fauna.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country and it was a long way to Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
The region is bordered on the north by the Sahel, on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that traveling women state that they are married, regardless of actual family status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be harassed, beaten, etc.
Don't be shy about rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences here and there, so it's not right either!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meronids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish traders who established trading bases there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina you can easily find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tajins, faience, leather goods, hookahs and a whole host of veils are sold, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that is ongoing in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla excursions in Africa.
You can take a Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get you to Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, far-away lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and makes it an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations during the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which provides different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park admission fees.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the area of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a glittering balcony diagram, made clear by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island in the direction of the Kowloon waterfront promenade opposite.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the spot that the British colonists claimed for themselves, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching from the coast over 80 km (50 mi) to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just a mangrove swamp, however, they are some of the last remaining remnants of the vast jungles that once stretched across the Ganges.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water bodies.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a protected area and it is estimated that there are now 400 king tigers and over 30 000 axe-herons in the area.
Buses run from the Interdistrict Bus Station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 6.30 and 7.30 am.
As the district-wide buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two 3.5 m wide footpaths.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs control is expected to be completed.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most significant indigenous group that lived in present-day Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the GuaycurÃº and PayaguÃ¡, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Rising Province of India", was born as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with the indigenous indigenous groups.
For the Spanish, the colonial era began, lasting three centuries.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las CaÃ±itas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check out AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is commonly accepted throughout the islands and credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the remote islands, although British and US currency are accepted; check in advance with the owners as to what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There is no particular "clean" and "dry" season: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although small animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 meters (330 feet) away from bears and wolves and 25 meters (80 feet) from all other wildlife.
No matter how fierce they look, bison, elk, deer, bears and all manner of large animals can attack.
Each year, these visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them at their distance.
In addition, be aware that the smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking solid food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, with a population of just under 40,000, and is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval dispute in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the assassination of the top leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches on Auckland's two harbours, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where one can safely swim, and most offer shade through Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour in the built-up suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast.
There are two local beers, the main one is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but is accepted and served; the other one is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that one must have tried, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be easier to find.
Local tap water can be safely drunk, but mineral water is easy to find if you're not confident.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is exotic. A short black is called 'espresso', cappuccino has a drip on top (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot cocoa meets Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, ask the authorities for advice, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, the whiting has been found on the beaches and estuaries from October to April, and is occasionally found outside during this time.
Sharks do come, but they attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers can rest assured that they will have somewhere to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals for certain hotels, although you may be able to book other accommodations such as camping through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include coffee, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined airline and hotel baggage.
They can also suspend the reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain other documents for your travel destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or inquiries should be addressed to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival participants choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be right in the middle of the action, you have to get up early to get a campsite next to the music.
Please note that even if the music in the main stage closes at the end, there may still be areas of the festival that play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Sea in winter, check the position of the cabin, as the ice breaking can cause some pretty creepy noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually missing and exits are difficult to find.
They regularly have special food, drinks and entertainment offerings to keep guests entertained and on the property.
Some venues offer alcohol on a drink-by-drive basis, but alcohol impairs judgment and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On dirt and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive like you would on Makadamm.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to cause a person to stay stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blown snow or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries and traffic is mostly undisturbed throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attractions in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland travel to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, leopards and cheetahs are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (other names are "bus tour", "walking safari" or "walking") consists of hikes, each lasting several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games as early as 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tight spot.
Cancellation terms vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation guidelines will not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between Â¥2,500 and Â¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around Â¥7,000.
Many hotels have a stretcher and a stretcher that can be borrowed even if you are not in the room.
If no stretch socks are available, or you do not feel like wearing stretch socks, you may try using a flip-flop if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to burn or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it may take several minutes.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you should be concerned, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests in their home regions that they are not familiar with.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers entering countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through remote forests.
If you are accustomed to driving on country roads, keep your feet together: tread the stairs, the narrow lanes, and the sharp edges.
The current speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections - usually 56 to 64 km/h (35 to 40 mph) - and adherence to them is even more important.
Strangely, however, the mobile service is much stronger than along other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit cake is common; apples are baked and baked all year round and kiwifruit and parsley are added in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other legumes. Popular cakes often go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you are looking for small but rich pastries, try what is offered as Berliner, pancake or potato depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, cooked together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can vary from "dry" to "to a sauce" depending on the liquid content.
In rural areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the nation.
However, when used without further labeling, the term usually means food from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offering a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the predominant flavours of Javanese cuisine being cacao beans, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The rider's feet are supported by the rider's feet and hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can cause safety concerns, as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but one foot gets caught in the stirrup, he may be able to jump when the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, small safety measures may be taken.
First, all riders wear riding boots with a low and a smooth, rather narrow, sole.
Next, some suits, especially English suits, have safety pins that allow a climber to fall off the suit if they are rear-ended by a falling rider.
CochamÃ³ Valley is Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its large granite walls and cliffs.
Some offer breathtaking views of the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are finding new routes amid the endless potential of the walls.
Downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending snow-covered terrain with skis attached to the feet or a snowboard.
Sailing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally called "ship enthusiasts", planning their entire vacation around sailing in a particular location.
The idea of navigation is very old, with cave paintings depicting navigators dating back to around 5000 BC.
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first leisure ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backpacking, backpacking, or backpacking.
It is related to, but not usually associated with, alpine-skiing tours or mountaineering, the latter taking place on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skiing and footwear.
Think of the path as a narrow path.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly greater distances than walking, but very few people can reach the speed of running without heavy backpacks on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would involve some visa and passport checks.
The Schengen area functions in this respect almost like a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antiques, and some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.

Rip currents are the retreating currents of waves that break on the beach, often at a reef or reefside.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and a fast current can form into the deep water.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue while trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the flow, swimming back is no more difficult than it used to be.
Try to get to a place where you will not be heard again, or depending on your abilities and whether you have been noticed, it may be advisable to wait for rescue.

The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here with the plateau, then reappear to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, also called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson as the highest point at 4,892 m (16,030 ft).

Finland is a wonderful destination for excursions by boat.The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has several thousand islands in its lakes and in its coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelago and in the sea, you don't necessarily need a yacht.

Boating is a national hobby in Finland with a boat for seven to eight people.
It is found in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise rather unique (for example, the number in the Netherlands is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days while you sleep on the ship at night.
If you only enter the country by sea, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises entice with Berlin (Germany) in the brochures. As you can see in the map above, however, Berlin is not located on the sea and the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.

For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often time is critical with business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the largest companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, it could have taken several days on some routes before everything was unloaded and passed customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger and that's where you come in.
The obvious choice when flying first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, let your company pay for it for you).
But it's not cheap: as a rule of thumb, expect to pay up to four times as much as business and 11 times as much as first class!
In general, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core of flight attendants who are willing to pay big dollars for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and convenient, and they demand it accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÅŸinÄƒu. The national language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
