Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already common in scientific circles, but it also provides information that fossils generally can't, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's ornamental feathers were brown oak-shaped on top and carotenoid on the bottom.
This finding also adds to our understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the feathers of this dinosaur don't have a well-developed rod called a stalk, but have other features of feathers -- beards and fine hair -- the researchers argue that the evolutionary development of the stalk was probably later than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather to regulate temperature or display. The researchers believe that even if this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, it still represents the adult feathers of the animal, not the cocks of a chicken.
The researchers said that even if this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, it still represents the plumage of an adult animal, not the cocoon of a chicken.

In France, voting has traditionally been done with primitive technology: voters were placed in individual ballot boxes and enveloped with a pre-printed piece of paper that represented their chosen candidate.
After the authorities confirm the identity of the voter, the voter puts the ballot paper in the ballot box and enters his signature in the voting list.
The French electoral law imposes relatively strict rules for these procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that at the beginning of voting there are no envelopes in them and no envelopes are added to them except the envelope of the authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe any part of the process. At night, votes are counted by volunteers, following special procedures, and under strict supervision.

Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their course, and 45 of the 117 large-bore openers failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General Dr. K. Arya said: "We arrested five men who had raped a Swiss woman and confiscated her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were present when the car hit the house, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road was temporarily closed as emergency services were trying to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Page Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Eden Brook Hospital in Cambridge.
Advocaat has since been charged with the murder of her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but any eyewitness may have been affected as his image has been widely circulated.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish courts have a different approach, and the courts have found the publication of the photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "Journalists seem to be stepping on the line of danger when they publish photos and so on of suspects".
The Scottish court, which is in overall charge of the case, told reporters that no further details will be given, at least until the crime is reported.
The document is based on this information leak and relates to the border dispute, in which Palestine demands a border demarcation in accordance with the conditions before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other reported topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, as well as the issue of Jordan Valley.
Israel has called for a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the parliament has agreed to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters participating in the supplemental pest control experiment had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the experiment was supervised and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Working together with the NPWS and the NSW Shooting Sports Association, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Shooting Sports Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director of park and heritage conservation with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday at the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Martelli CEP in the last four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests were caused by the non-conduct of elections that were scheduled to be held in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 extreme warming events, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry in a reaction called Apple's delay in reporting "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 am local time (Friday 09:19 pm Greenwich time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no casualties were reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has kidnapped a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and taken Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers, were initially released.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Leggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began her career at the Auckland National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in her spare time.
Her research showed that if the hormone is prescribed, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lung.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight records from the black box on Wednesday.
The fellow pirates paid tribute to Luna as well.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night she was two months old. She was so beautiful and unique. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented: "Luna was as temperamental as I was... maybe more so than I was... I loved her but I left her... hopefully she'll be in a better situation".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister of the Transitional Government, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic after the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those polled want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29% of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia should never become a republic.
She was an Olympic gold medalist in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaint, there were doubts about her fitness at these competitions.
He has not been able to get the medication he needs to overcome his pain because it is banned.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are likely to be a source of water and organic materials that could make up proteins and life.
Scientists hope to learn how planets form, especially how Earth formed after a comet collision in ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage later this month.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and libel".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) claims that the NextGen system will enable aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology versus ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to track aircraft more accurately and gives pilots more precise information.
No additional vehicles are allowed to enter, and there will be no surface trains stopping at Wembley, and no parking and ride facilities for the playground.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that they might have to play the game behind closed doors and without team sponsors.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the evolution of a new species in just two generations, although it was believed that because of crossbreeding between a native Darwinian cactus, the medium terrestrial cactus, and a migratory cactus, the giant cactus, the process took much longer.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes. It can be made into very tiny rings.
It can be drawn on thin wire that can be twisted and woven together. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "The Alchemist".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The water of the closed cabbage changes the color of the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are derived (since hydrogen atoms are made up of only one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then squeeze them with dry, clean hands until they are ball-shaped.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels interesting, and forms a kind of shell.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro has a toilet equipped with a flash tank connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the cities of Minoan and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Iran, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would gather in mixed groups.
When you're communicating with someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite picks up the call in space and reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a large rocket over 100 feet high.
The evolution that the wheel has brought to the world is incredible. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is make transportation easier and faster.
The wheel has given us trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
Below this group are the more medium-bodied felines that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to mountain goats and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including lazy domestic cats) that eat large numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of kinam, the specific thing that each kitten does to keep it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the felines, and they live in large groups called herds.
The perids consist of one to three related adult males along with thirty females and pups.
Women are usually closely related and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion herd behaves very much like wolves or dogs, animals that behave remarkably like lions (but not other big cats), and are very deadly to their prey.
Like a six-legged athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, run long distances, and pull something with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is also grouped with the lion, leopard, and jaguar (genus Panthera). These four species are the only cats that can growl.
A tiger's roar is not the full sound of a lion's roar, but more like a phrase of roaring words.
Leopards like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the leopard hunts are much smaller than its body.
Scientists think that the American road leopard tracks animals by smell, finds prey, and follows their footprints on the ground by sniffing.
They can see well in the dark because of their night vision, and they move very quietly. To hunt prey, the ocelot first camouflages itself in the surroundings and then suddenly dives on to prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small community) separates from the main community to which it belongs (such as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different capabilities or adaptations to be considered a strong competitor, in addition to what they already needed.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need previous adaptations to the environment.
Over time, as the new population adapts to their new environment, they become less and less like other people.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can't be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which just means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit.
Plants photosynthesize their food from the sun. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaur was the greatest hunter of his era, so he feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that came its way.
We're not sure, but it may have had a tongue-in-cheek diet of turtles, big fish, and other predators, and it may have even been a homophobe.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus wouldn't make a difference.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange and unusual items, including wild boars, peacocks, snails and a species of rodent called the hibernating mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat at their tables and ate their meals, the rich men liked to have banquets together and have fun while they ate their meals together.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods brought in later centuries from the Americas and Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People were expected to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests were expected to try to meet the needs of the gods during ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and behind it an inner temple that only clergy could enter.
Sometimes pyramid towers were built in a specific shape, called a ziggurat, as part of a temple.
The top of the tower was God's own sanctuary.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home didn't matter much.
This Jewish family spent most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the backyard; stores were play counters that looked out onto the street; houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was gradually settled. In the Norse epic, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "Treasure Nation", you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears in reverse at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that this large calligraphic document was hung for safekeeping early in its life, measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches.
So, it's possible that the note was merely pasted as a label.
The landings of the day of the invasion and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French of the "Voix". These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and instead of fighting the invaders, collaborated with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture held by a very large group of people, a community, who live and work together.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city, and to some extent also defines the size of society.
Civilized culture refers to the transmission of knowledge across generations, a long cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
Microcultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and cannot be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government under the principles of the Confederacy - of which Congress was the sole constituent.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, because there was no national executive or judiciary, and it relied on government officials, who often did not cooperate, to carry out all its actions.
It also had no reference to the abolition of taxation and tariff laws between countries.
Before the amendment of these clauses, it was necessary to obtain the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states also had to obtain the positive opinion of their central government even in the absence of a representative.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world, after the German national team, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Common sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "island complex" in geographical terms.
The origins of Taiwan go back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a revolution in indigenous grain production operations and employing Chinese laborers to work on its sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of the western and northern areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the Qing government's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 to 1895), it signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main monuments, called the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the fringes of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, it borrows its image ratios from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Actually, the 35mm format is a little bit confusing, and it's 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (which we divide by 12 to get the simplest ratio with integers) is equal to 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family formats) have this aspect ratio or very close to it.
The very annoying and ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guide to creating dynamics while maintaining order in an image.
states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three vertical and horizontal images (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being monitored.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the monarch to the common man.
One of the core beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's treasury was created for exactly that reason.
The central power of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has served its purpose.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade violated all international laws that had been accepted by several international agreements over the past two centuries, it proved to be an effective strategy to cut off vital military and civilian resources.
The UK mines international waters and even threatens neutral shipping to prevent any vessel from entering entire sections of the ocean.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unconditional submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitude in most citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of war during World War I, nations resolved to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to New York City in the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with four pennies to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bechler (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each time period was a distinct dynasty from China or from each family that held power.
There was also an unstable era between each dynasty, with provinces being divided. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred over 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is considered one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying to gain the highest seat in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, including the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also, post-revolution jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing for more ambitious and successful people to succeed.
The same is true for the military, because instead of ranking the military, it was now ranked by ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to go to a cave called Hara in Mount Nur for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, gives a very clear idea of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knows that there is such a thing, it's not easy to find it.
Nothing is seen but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only surviving of the Seven Wonders still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of several large pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Pyramid Complex in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), and several smaller tombs, temples, and a large statue of Abul Hawl.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward" symbol is a V, and the "downward" symbol is a pendulum or a square without an end.
Top means you start at the top and pull the arches, and bottom means you start at the heel (which is where you grab the arches by hand) and pull the arches forward.
Usually, pulling the arch towards the violin's handle produces a softer sound, while the back movement is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to draw your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed Arschaean markings have a musical aspect to them, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified queen, Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
One member of the crowd is said to have shaken the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The cost of the US imperialist war in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay their taxes to the American colonial regime to pay off the bulk of the costs and profits of the Philippine government bonds through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extraordinary profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the fundamental achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that gave rise to this order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly called the Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages, ending by the Convention around 1500.
Technological algebra is a term that actually encompasses a range of ideas, from the pressure of technology or technological necessity to the precise meaning of the word as the fundamental logic of the laws of science and their emergence in technology govern human destiny.
Most interpretations of technological algebra share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn "influences" more native societies than conditioned societies.
For example, one might say that cars necessarily led to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership also leads to high road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new methods in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a huge element of cultural algebra, which originated with writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography shaped people, and over time, the customs and culture of that geography emerged, and these were in harmony with the position of society, which was better than the rules that were dictatorial.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of nobility began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its position was weakened as the Crusaders returned gifts such as silk and spices, which were worth more than the supply of the Eastern Roman market.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was mainly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, styles in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop fashion. One of the biggest developments of the time was the result of the Crusades, and people started using buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done in order to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the bioregions along with rotational cultivation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers made a living through subsistence agriculture, and this still exists in many developing countries.
Microcultures also bring together people who feel they are being ignored by society's standards and give them a sense of identity.
Microcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, place of residence and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these characteristics.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, ambience, and deliberate idiom.
One of the most common ways that is used to explain the importance of socialization is to help with the unfortunate cases of children who did not learn socialization during their development due to neglect, abuse, or intentional abuse by adults.
Some of these children are imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the release of the child is due to the parents' denial of the child's severe mental and physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or emotional trauma before the child left or ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (in the physical realm) that are almost animal-like, such as fear and indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more fun, scavenging goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that supports people who are getting a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Ladders can be virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of ladder, but the little paper handle in Microsoft Office is a ladder.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software and aims to question, provoke and explain ways that might be challenging for students to do on their own.
Children are placed in nursing homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that lacks nourishment, care and discipline, but it does happen.
We think of the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system strives to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, sustainable education and reliable health care.
Adoption requires that the adoptee's needs are met in the previous home from which he or she was taken.
The Internet combines elements of collective and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usability and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "sociability" are cited as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "persistent engagement" were also identified by Amy and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience response to websites.
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting small sentences, it is possible to detect that a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", showed how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess the sincerity of intentions.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior could be common in animals like domestic dogs.
20th-century research showed that there are two sources of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation and remove selection from the pool of expressed variation.
The separation and recombination of the difference between the two pools moves back and forth with each generation.
Outside the savannah, meeting the amino acid-based needs of available plant sources would have been difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system.
And the consequences of not doing so are serious: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant source of protein is in leaves and beans, but it's hard for mammals like us to digest, unless it's cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (eels, chickens, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep disorder is the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and falling back to sleep after a period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to keep you awake without waking you up completely.
If you find that you turn off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a particular diuretic) before bedtime, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calmness of a person is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and the soul of a person.
The less stress, the more positive the gift of life force. Every person has the ability to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, and it involves the Kandalini, yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Using Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga movements, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods. Through the incarnation of various gods, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, differences in system, process and culture led to the separation of these countries.
As the last two years of the war passed, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and to fight with proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places, in real time.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Spire.
But these plans were shattered almost overnight, when more than 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and, after invading eastern Poland, established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the Navy's job was to ensure that your country had the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One example that's worth mentioning is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans were trying to get people and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
Meanwhile, the German Navy was mainly using U-boats to try to stop the passage.
If Germany had defeated the Allies, maybe it could have defeated Britain because it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have first been domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds on hills or other grazing areas, and were often tended by goatherds, often children and teenagers, similar to the usual shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
The wagon line was built in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
The railway was introduced almost from the beginning to hold trains in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that if there was an iron bar on the railway track, the trains would be more efficient.
Although this became common, iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually wooden wheels replaced iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railways were introduced.
The first form of transportation was walking; humans started walking standing up two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors were Southerners who did not walk normally, as they were accustomed to.
Bipolar speciation was present in the Southern Copper fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although the Chadian people may have walked on two feet from seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become environmental activists to help mitigate some of the pain of the future.
This is exactly like many supportive therapies, however, if we're not just looking for a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and we need to deactivate it.
It is clear that the world has changed because of human advances in science and technology, and the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and the strange way of life of humans.
After it was passed by Congress on the Fourth of July, a written draft signed by John Hancock, the president of Congress, and Charles Thomson, the secretary, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were created, which is now known as "Dunlap Media".
John Nixon was the first to read the document in public on July 8 in the Independence Hall courtyard.
On July 6 a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10 a copy arrived in London.
The Dunlap 25 is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and they can fly, many people don't recognize them as dinosaurs.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a tiger.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and in computer jargon these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits.
Internal intoxication is not immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they cannot be detected immediately.
The best cause of internal poisoning may be the presence of an empty medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for the specific first aid instructions for that particular toxin.
Entomologists use the term "sausage" in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitism in humans.
Both bed bugs and bed bug killers are bed-dwellers, meaning they adapt to living in a nest or living in a host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is an important neurological disease in younger and older adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can arrange an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the parents terminate their parental rights to give custody to another couple.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not a stand-alone case, it is an experiment and an experiment that is necessary to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, as well as to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek scholarship declined, the West lost touch with its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
Many consider physiological and behavioral rhythms to be often seriously linked to the existence of the innate cycle and its production by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Oscillatory biological clocks are self-sustaining instruments that continue a period of a free-floating cycle in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first indications of the genetics of DNA.
Each and every one of them used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA inside the bacteria.
They did two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the phage with phosphoric light or the protein of the phage with sulfuric light.
Mutations can have very different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells involved are germline cells or not.
Only mutations in cells that are similar to the microbe can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-friendly tourism is the practice of attracting people to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery such as plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about the Angus Organza in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the city by car to go to work and are driven by others who are going to the same place they came from.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a transportation system based on personal cars.
Now science shows that this big carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, the state that has fueled and supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why are transportation systems causing such complaints, why do we see them fail every day? Is it because of the inefficiency of automotive engineers? Or is there a deeper reason?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of autonomous drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, because the behavior of a driver cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range, so traffic flows tend to have a reasonable structure, and this can be determined almost mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three characteristics are defined: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) acceleration.
These relationships help plan, design and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more easily.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This ability allows them to hide from predators in a wider range of small spaces.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are the firefly and the day-flying mosquito.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because on the ground, you don't feel like you're moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, reaching six miles wide in places.
The full 20 percent of the water that flows from the Earth's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River's main basin is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramid continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, there was never a pyramid that surpassed the Triple Pyramid in size and technical superiority.
The new kingdom of ancient Egypt was amazed to see the historic monuments of its predecessors, buildings that were more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and administrative communications.
Italian is also a daily language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these elements can be found in pure form in nature and are relatively easy to extract with basic tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that all things were made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they would change into new materials and form what we see.
Alloys are basically combinations of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain some nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in this universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit at the end of this sentence.
So, when the pencil came out, it became a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil is used less and less.
Today, people write their messages on a computer screen, and they never have to go near a sharpened pencil.
One can only wonder what the queue of the matrix will be like when nothing ever works out.
Nuclear fission is based on the principle that the collapse of a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons takes energy.
It's kind of like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus of an atom again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to collapse without a signal or with a small signal.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and soil. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km thick at the far side.
The seabed is thinner and the plateau is thicker.
As the crust becomes thinner, there may be more sediment on the near side, making it easier for the lava to rise and surface.
Content theories are based on what there are things that people are replicating or liking.
These theories suggest that individuals have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized during development and into adulthood.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want to do the things they do and what is in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors emerge: one at the top of the spectrum is trying to stay on, one of the guys.
This type of manager has trouble making unusual decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable person who feels that he has to change everything the team has done and do it himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often creates a rift between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their physical neighborhood.
They often have more autonomy than contracted team members because their teams can meet based on different time zones, but their local management may not be aware of these time zones.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The management team is the "invisible team" to which each member reports. This invisible team sets the specific standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to enter the process of establishing an educational organization?
When all available resources are used effectively in the operational units of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can occur.
As a result, the process of organizational collaboration to overcome barriers can lead to a new creative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the sequential approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the backbone of scientific research.
It's long been recognized that different types of brain injury, emotional trauma, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand how our minds work.
Although AI has strong implications for science fiction stories, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in the AI industry involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer problems and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as embedded in numerous home computers and video game software applications.
The teacher often likes to take his students to places that do not have the option of traveling by bus.
Technology provides a solution by enabling virtual science trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting next to their classmates in class.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, which is revised each year, but older versions are kept online for use as notebooks.
Blogs can also help to improve a student's writing skills. Although students often start their blogging with grammatical and spelling confusion, audience presence generally makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to avoid criticism in order to improve his writing.
Although blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them", the need to satisfy the interest of the student audience encourages awareness and curiosity (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; and through actively responding to online content, students can express their positions in the context of others' writings as well as their views on specific topics (O'Rourke, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming and bilingual capital, and has a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more highlight Ontario to outsiders as something that is truly Canadian.
Large areas in the more northerly regions are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
To give you a demographic comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans than Canadians in the United States.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and the only continent of its kind.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to these lands as well, and it took shape on a large scale in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is surrounded by the Sahara coast and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that female passengers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also beneficial to get a ring (not necessarily one that looks expensive.
Women need to recognize that cultural differences may lead to events that they find annoying and that they are unlikely to be followed and held by someone, and so on.
Be firm in discouraging men and resist without fear (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make the situation better!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port, calling it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and then rebuilt it as Casablanca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Dar al-Bijda, and Spanish merchants who established their trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive cities in Morocco for shopping.
Around the old city, you can find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as crockery, pottery, leather goods, quilts and a full range of prints, but all of these are for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east and near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Although security in Goma is handled responsibly, any visit outside Goma should be considered in order to understand the situation of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Mount Nyiragongo volcano, along which are the cheapest gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use motor taxis to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is about 500 CFA for a short ride.
The city of tymbokto, which was almost too inaccessible, has led to its name being used as a metaphor for strange and inaccessible lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it has a tourist attraction and an airport because of its antiquity.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
That stop was one of the main stops during the PBS special Louis Gates called "Wonders of the African World".
It is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African characteristics.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique and north along the border with Zimbabwe, with the southern boundary being the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different biogeographical territories, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, day-care and admission is charged.
It can be useful to purchase a game card that allows entry to a selection of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is a place where many tourists consider it as their main tourist focus.
The buildings that line Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glowing bar chart, revealed by their presence along the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across the mouth of the Kowloon Bay.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated along the northern coastline in reclaimed land.
This is the place where the British colonists took it for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest integrated belt of maple trees in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coast of Bangladesh and India to the inland regions.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested section located in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans Forest Park.
These forests are not just the Karnataka marshes - they are also home to some of the last remnants of the dense forests that once covered the Sindh and Ganges.
The Sundarbans area is about 3,850 square kilometers, and about a third of it is water/marsh.
The Sandarban has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer seen in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-regional station (by the river) throughout the day, but most of them depart especially for the east and Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-regional buses are often crowded, it is recommended to book a few days in advance.
Most areas are covered by the small Japanese sea buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are one of the quick and convenient ways to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oiapoque River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical distance under the tower is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be completed in September 2017, which is the expected completion date for the customs stations.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and subsisting on subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant State of the Indies", was born as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' encounter with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of its indigenous characteristics and personalities.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best squads and players in the world.
The biggest race of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas bullring.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed at other times of the year.
For news of the competition and where to buy tickets for the main competition, check out Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley and along the FIC West store, offers money exchange.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley and US dollar credit cards are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted in more remote islands, although UK and US currency is accepted; check with the owners in advance for the most acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures typically reach over 30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity work together to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "dry" and "wet" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, it is still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
As per the park's instructions, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from other wildlife!
The American buffalo, the deer, the reindeer, the bear, and almost all large animals, however tame they may seem, can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance. These are large, wild, and inherently dangerous animals, so don't go into their territory.
Also, note that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food from the bog and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port is famous for stopping a fleet attack in 1889, when seven German, US and British ships did not leave the port.
All but one British warship sank, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the township led to the killing of the chief of the Tupua Tamasese, Lealofi III.
Because of Auckland's location between two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor region) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Dunport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most of them have the shade of Putuokawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the popular towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes busy and have nice shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and fresh. Another local beer is called Manta.
There are plenty of French wines to consume, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better shipped.
Drinking local tap water is perfectly safe, but if you're afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, "Flat White" coffee is an alien idea. Black shorts are the same as "Espresso", cappuccino is served with plenty of cream (not just flour), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reefs are made throughout the year, and injuries caused by these factors are rare in the reefs.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow the signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box sea brides are found near the shores and near the mouths of rivers north of 1770 from October to April. They can occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and shy away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the comfort of knowing that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can probably find out about other types of accommodation, such as camping, through the travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation from/to the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also book an appointment for you if you need time to think about the offer or to prepare other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Therefore, any corrections or requests should be made through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, a large portion of the audience at music festivals choose to camp on-site, and most audiences consider this a key part of the program.
If you want to be close to the stage, you have to arrive early to be able to get to the campsite close to the age of the music performance.
Keep in mind that although the music may have ended in the main performance scenes, parts of the festival may continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location because there are some pretty scary noises for those who are most affected when crossing the ice.
A stay in St. Petersburg includes spending time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows and no clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests entertained and stay in place.
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages; however, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or high mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy roads, there is little friction, and you can't drive on bare asphalt.
In a storm, the snow can be so heavy in a moment that it can trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or falling snow or by the presence of ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic flows largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, attracting many visitors.
The term "safari" generally refers to a trip by land to observe the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to avoid cars, and standard equipment allows for proper inspection.
Lions, giraffes and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with a hunting camera.
A safari is a hike (also called a "hike on the branches and leaves", "hike on safari", or "hike") that involves walking for several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will run from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a terrible situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not continue until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket cost of around 7,000 yen.
Rinsing wet clothes can help dry them. In many hotels, it is possible to borrow a car and a table, even if it is not in the room.
If you do not have access to a car or do not want to wear socks, you can use a washing machine if you have access.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too hot (which can cause watering or, worse, burn).
There are various methods for water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, and in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're concerned about this, you should consider buying your drinking water in bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter species of pests that are unfamiliar to them in their native areas.
Pest animals spoil food, cause harassment or, worse, cause allergic reactions, spread their venom, or cause the transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with their power are not usually described as disasters.
Shopping at duty-free stores is an opportunity to buy goods without paying taxes and duties in some places.
Travel restrictions for countries with heavy taxes can sometimes result in significant savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between the Point Marion and Fairmont areas has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo Freeway, as it passes through scattered secluded woodlands to the globe.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are steep inclines, narrow bands and more sharp turns.
The speed limits installed are significantly less than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than in the other sections.
Surprisingly, cell phone service here is much stronger than other points along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German desserts are very good, and in Bavaria they are varied and rich, and more like what is cooked in the southern neighbor in Austria.
Fruit desserts are common. Apple desserts are baked all year round, and in summer cherries and apples are used for decoration.
Many German desserts have almonds, hazelnuts and other tree dried fruits. Popular cakes are often served with a thick cup of coffee.
If you want small but rich desserts, try something called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on where you are.
Curry is a food prepared with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid available, the work can be "dry" or "dry".
In the mid-northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in salads; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines across the nation, as Indonesia has a choice of 17,000 islands.
However, in the absence of further jurisdiction, the term originally means food and is derived from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese food, now widely available throughout the Algerian archipelago, contains a range of simple spicy dishes, the predominant Javanese flavorings being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The backrest is sometimes for the rider's foot, which is suspended on either side of the seat.
Although they provide greater stability for the rider, they can also raise safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse will be dragged to the ground if he runs away. To minimize this risk, many precautions can be taken.
First, most motorcyclists wear motorcycle boots that have a heel and a heel that is flat and perfectly narrow.
In a later stage, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the rider's skin to separate from the saddle in the event of a fall.
In Cochamó - the top climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, there are different types of granite walls and cliffs.
At the highest point, breathtaking views of the peaks can be seen. Climbers from all over the world continually discover new routes through the many trails and potential walls.
Winter hill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you ski on snow-covered slopes using a ski pole or snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity of travel, with many enthusiasts and is sometimes known as "skiing the circle", that is, planning the entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old -- cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5,000 BC.
The sport of skiing on hills dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first ski resort club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to but usually does not include ski touring or alpine-style mountaineering, the latter performed on steep terrain and requiring more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail the same way you think of a hiking trail.
In good weather conditions, you can cover much more distance than walking - but it's very rare to be able to ski cross-country at speed without carrying a heavy backpack on the regular trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling between multiple countries requires going through visa application and passport control processes several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a country in this sense.
As long as you are a resident of the area, you can generally cross the border without going through the passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you no longer need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for the antiquity of manufactured items. Some tax authorities consider goods older than 100 years to be antiquated.
This definition varies geographically, especially in parts like North America where the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Rearing reindeer is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the cultural exchange that surrounds the trade is also important for many other professions.
Although traditionally, not all Sami were involved in raising large deer, they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, and used deer mostly as service animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern business. Tourism is one of the important sources of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romans, the word κολί is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of the Roman people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to use advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
Warnings are merely a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, general, and very simple compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for a dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage and disrupt social life or cause loss of human life.
Dry weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Extreme winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires, as well as lightning, tornadoes, waterfalls, and monsoon storms are all forms and effects of extreme weather.
Extreme regional and seasonal weather events include hurricanes, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather conditions affecting their area, as these can affect travel plans.
Anyone who intends to visit a country that is considered a war zone must undergo vocational training.
An internet search for the term 'hostile environment' will likely reveal the address of a local company.
A training course usually covers all the issues raised here in much more detail and usually includes practical experience.
A training course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and involves role-playing and a high volume of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines on survival in the wild, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travellers who intend to undergo gender reassignment abroad must have valid documents for the return journey.
Governments' willingness to issue genderless passports (X) or to update documents to match the name and gender of the person in question varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to certify these documents varies widely.
The inspections at security checkpoints have also become much more intense in the post-9/11 period.
Transgender people should not expect to pass scans before surgery, while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the backflow of waves moving from the coast to the sea, often occurring on a rock or similar location.
The backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections due to the underwater topology, and rapid downward flow may occur there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, it won't be any harder to swim back to normal.
Try to target a place where you won't get trapped again, or, depending on your skills, whether you've been spotted or not, you can wait for a rescue.
Homecoming shock occurs earlier than culture shock (it is shorter than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily assimilated to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to return to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have become accustomed to a new culture and have lost some of your own customs from your home culture.
At the beginning of their foreign journey, people were probably patient and understanding, and they knew that travelers who arrived in a new country needed to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound of the pyramid and the light show are one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you can always hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx stands behind the scenes and narrates a long story.
These scenes are projected onto the pyramid, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many countries and have the most active base in the world, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the peninsula. Its largest island is King George, and its residential area is called Villa Las Estrellas (Village of the Stars).
Other islands include Livingstone and Deception, whose volcanic lake has provided a spectacular natural harbor atop an active volcano.
Elthoroth Land is an area in the south of the peninsula bounded by the Blingshausen Sea.
The peninsular mountains here merge with the plateau, then re-peak to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which has been cut in half by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which rises to an elevation of 4,892 m (16,029 ft) on Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell coverage, satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are not generally a replacement for mobile phones, as to make a phone call you need to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite.
These services are used globally by vessels, including leisure and tourist boats, which have remote data and audio requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular is for people who plan a year away and devote it to travel and learning.
It is especially popular with those who have just left school, and allows them to take a year off before university without risking their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of getting a higher education when you return to your homeland.
These courses usually require a fee.
Finland is a great boating destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal peninsulas.
You don't necessarily need a boat in this complex of islands and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and larger lakes are large enough for sailboats, small boats and even paddle boats offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a ratio of one boat for every seven or eight people.
The countries are similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but apart from that it's very unique (for example in the Netherlands it's one in forty).
A feature of many of the Baltic cruises is that they have a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend several full days visiting this historic city, while returning to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only take a cruise ship to the coast, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochure. But as you can see from the map above of Berlin, no part of the city is near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic accident.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fear and hatred of other things that exists in many people.
For some, understanding how airplanes work and what happens in flight may help overcome the fear of the unknown and the lack of control.
The delivery companies are paid well for the fast delivery of products. Usually, time is of the essence in sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for quick repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes, there was a problem for the smaller companies.
If they sent things by airmail, it could take days for air and customs to load on some routes.
The only way to get there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations would not allow them to send baggage without a passenger.
The most common way to fly first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for a ticket (or better yet, ask your airline to arrange it).
However, it doesn't come cheap: a general rule says you can expect to pay four times the normal rent for economy mode for business mode and eleven times that for first class!
In general, searching for discounts on business and first class seats on flights from point A to point B is useless.
Airlines are well aware that a group of air travelers with emergency conditions are willing to pay a lot of money to get the benefit of fast and convenient travel, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that suffers from ethnic and tribal conflict.
In 1994, this dispute led to the creation of the autonomous republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion of the Moldovan people is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city and second largest port in Turkey after Istanbul, with a population of about 3.7 million, and is one of the most important transportation hubs in the country.
Once upon a time, the ancient city of Smyrna, now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, was built around a huge bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls, with their traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century bazaar and old mosques and churches, are all visible, although the atmosphere is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Hadarsvik has a view of the island near Eysturoy and the church has an unusual octagonal cross.
In the courtyard of this church there are interesting marble statues of pigeons on some of the tombs.
It's worth a half-hour's stroll around this charming village.
In the north, in an easily accessible area, lies the romantic and charming city of Sintra, which became famous to foreigners after it was splendidly recorded by Lord Byron.
The 403 Scatterbus is a regular service to Sintra and stops at Kabodaruca.
Also visit the Great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a site known worldwide for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave site, and also a site that has almost incalculable meaning for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived here, and many others who had loved ones murdered there or worked so hard that they died, Jew or Gentile.
Please visit this place with all the dignity, honor and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the place by painting walls or engraving on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it is legally recognized as the first official language.
Despite this, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other places.
Regular notifications in the metro are only expressed in Catalan, but out-of-program malfunctions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are self-righteous, rude and arrogant.
While this is a misconception held by most people, it is still the best way to be friendly in Paris to be polite and behave like a bien élevé (well-behaved). This makes it considerably easier to get around.
If you show some basic manners, the seemingly unexpected behavior of Parisians will be immediately remedied.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has a rich forest cover and is mainly covered with varieties of rush, Christmas tree and spruce trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a significant wide diversity of plant communities due to the vastness of its micro-regions, diverse soils and varied elevation levels.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, black bear, wildcat and black wildcat can be found here along with many other common species.
While visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and shoulders should also be covered.
Most monasteries have appropriate coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your coverings, especially brightly colored ones, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun upon entering.
By the same token, men are also required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
It can also be borrowed from the pantry in the lobby, but the clothes are not washed by the user after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For all men, one size fits all!
Like similar regions in the Mediterranean, the cuisine of Mallorca is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil from beginning to end.
Pa amb Oli is a popular simple dinner, especially during the summer: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available seasonings such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All names, besides the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even if they come in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way of distinguishing between certain verbs and adjectives.
It also makes reading considerably easier, although writing is somewhat complex and requires knowing whether a verb or adjective is used correctly.
Pronunciation of Italian words is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are the c and the g, because their pronunciation differs based on the vowels that follow them.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
So, reading this grammar primer will help you to learn more about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know one of the Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, those who knew some Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is so close that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now generally abandoned and are now museums or educational centers.
Because light pollution was not a problem in the beginning but is now, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses and are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Watching the cherry blossoms has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where the chosen flower was the apple blossom.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom ceremony is held by the emperor and only for himself and members of the nobility close to the imperial court.
Plants are at their best when they're in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove just one sample.
If the visit to the garden is officially arranged, collecting the 'sample' without any discussion will result in your dismissal.
Singapore is generally very safe and easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But being in the "northern hemisphere", just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with the heat (always) and the intense sunlight (when the sky is clear and it's very rare).
Also, a few buses head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of great biblical leaders including Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Al Khalil and not just to the Jewish suburb of Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good choice for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or traveling to interesting places on the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also designate popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the anniversary of the birth of Jesus.
Many of the holiday's traditions have also been adopted by those in non-Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend the night of Easter in places that are exposed to the sun, to watch the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian religious justifications for this tradition, but it is safe to say that it may have been a pre-Christian celebration of spring and harvest.
Most traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter holidays, while the congregation often celebrates at midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands either came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals couldn't travel there, so the giant tortoise is the main animal that feeds in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced to the island, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the North or South Pole in winter, you'll see a polar night, meaning the sun never rises above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora, as the sky will be more or less dark during the daytime.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and often do not have light pollution, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The uniforms are standard work clothes, and co-workers call each other by their family name or by their job title.
Workplace compromise is critical, and it should emphasize team effort rather than individual success.
Workers must often gain the approval of their bosses for every decision they make, and they are expected to obey their bosses' instructions without a reason.
