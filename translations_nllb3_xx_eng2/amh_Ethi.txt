Martelli is sworn in as a member of the new nine-member Transitional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended early resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests have arisen from the lack of elections, some since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod overheating were reported, with a total of six fires resulting in four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says it has identified 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which Apple called "minor".
The minister responded by calling Apple's shifting of the reporting "really tragic".

No additional travel is being added and no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and no parking and pick-up facilities are available on the ground.
Fears of lack of transportation have increased the likelihood that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the appearance of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species was created in just two generations, despite the fact that it was expected to take longer due to the breeding between the Darwin's finch, Geospisa fortress, and the exotic cactus finch, Geospisa coniortris.
gold is melted into all kinds of shapes. it can be rolled into tiny rings.
It can be bent and bent into a thin wire. It can be twisted or rolled into a round shape.
it was made so thin and glued to other metal. it was so thin that it was used as a decoration in the hand-painted illustrations in the illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. Using red clover solution, they can make an index.
packaged cabbage juice changes color according to the chemical acidity or alkalinity.
The pH level in the test chemical indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (so hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
combine the two dry powders, and then with clean, wet hands, place them in a ball.
The moisture on your hands will conflict with the outer layers, which makes a funny feeling and a kind of fog.
The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-Daro had flush toilets in every house, equipped with an advanced sewage system.
The remains of the sewer system were found in houses in Crete and Santorini in Minoan, Greece.
In ancient egypt, persia, and china, toilets were also a feature of the public baths, where men and women sometimes shared the same bathroom.
they're using a satellite to call someone thousands of miles away.
the satellite in space will receive the call and instantly reflect it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Because the earth's atmosphere alters some of the light and views, researchers use space telescopes.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket more than 100 feet high is needed.
the wheel has changed the world dramatically. the greatest thing it has done for us is to make transportation so much easier and faster.
He has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
At their base are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals, from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including the larger pet cats) that eat a huge variety of small animals such as insects, mice, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the field theory, a unique task that prevents each cat from competing with the others.
lions are very social cats, living in large groups called herds.
a pride of lions consists of one to three young males, up to thirty females, and young.
The females are often closely related to each other, with many being families of sisters and daughters.
Lion's mane is as dangerous to wolves or dogs, to animals like lions (but not other big cats), and to their predators.
The tiger is a well-rounded athlete, able to climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
tiger belongs to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus pantra). only these four cats can roam.
The tiger's roar is not a full-voiced roar like a lion's, but more like a phrase of noise and roar words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots save are much smaller than they are.
Scientists find oselotes/desert cats following the animals they feed on by sniffing their way to their home on Earth.
They have excellent night vision and good mobility. They find prey by adapting to their environment.
Small organisms (small populations) often find themselves in a different environment from the one in which the main population originated (for example, if they have crossed a mountainous area or a river or travelled to a new island from which they cannot easily return).
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new species will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it has ever needed to be.
The original breed has never been modified, and they still require the same adaptations as before.
over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, their similarity to other peoples diminishes.
eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two peoples will be so different in appearance that they will no longer be considered the same species.
we call this process speciation, which means the making of new species. the making of new species is an inevitable result and an essential part of evolution.
plants make the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
plants use sunlight to prepare their food. they provide shade.
plants make our homes and our clothes. most of the food we eat is plant food. animals cannot live without plants.
the mosasaurus was the top predator of its day, so it feared nothing but the other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were armed with more than 70 razor-shaped teeth and held an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anyone who crossed the path.
We don't know for sure, but it had a forked tongue. Its diet included elk, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly its own offspring.
It would attack anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
Although we know most of their food, the Romans had exotic or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, shrimp, and dormouse
another difference is that the poor and women sit on benches and eat, while the rich eat their food, and they like to have a big party where they enjoy each other on the side.
ancient roman cuisine could not incorporate the foods that in later centuries were introduced to europe from america or asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey chicken.
the babylonians built a large temple to each of their gods, which was considered a house of their gods.
the people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to cater to the gods' needs through festivals and festivals.
each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
sometimes, the temples were joined by towers, called ziggurats, in the shape of special pyramids.
the top of the wall was a special sanctuary for his goddess.
In the warm middle eastern climate, the house was of little use.
most hebrew families lived outdoors.
women cooked in the courtyard, and stores had open counters facing the street. stone was used to build houses.
there were no large forests in the land of canaan, so wood was very expensive.
According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, on his journey westward, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
but whatever his findings, eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you saw the movie national treasure, you would think that a treasure map was written on the back of the declaration of independence.
However, that is not true. Despite what is written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
The words "The first day of the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776", appear on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is shown in italics at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, early in its life, the largest parchment document (293‚ÅÑ4 inches by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was folded to fit inside.
Therefore, the note may have been added as a token only.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south had still not been liberated.
It was run by the French of Jovici. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
within two weeks, the american and free french forces were liberating southern france and returning to germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a vast community of people living and working together.
The word civilization comes from civilis, which means civil, when combined with the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or municipal government, which in some sense describes the size of a community.
City-states are the predecessors of states. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any valuable historical evidence and are not recognized as a formal civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - meaning that Congress became the sole body - under the Articles of Confederation.
the council had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or court, it often relied on uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
nor did it have the authority to revoke tax laws and tariffs between provinces.
Before the articles were ratified, they required unanimous consent from all the regions, and their representatives were largely left behind because the regions did not properly take over the central government.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national team, is the most successful team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

With Italians competing at the World Games and the Olympics, winter sports are most popular in the northern regions.
japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is honsh≈´), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often called an "archipelago" in geographical terms because of its archipelago of islands
taiwan began in the 15th century when european sailors named the island ilha formosa, or beautiful island, when they passed through.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its foundation, inspiring a change in the grain management practices of the natives of southern Taiwan and hiring Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the first sino-japanese war (1894-1895), the qing government signed the treaty of shimonoskin, surrendering sovereignty over taiwan to japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
the machu picchu inthavatha consists of three main structures called the intihatana, the temple of the sun, and the three-mirrored chamber.
Most of the buildings on the campus have been reconstructed to give tourists a better understanding of how they first arrived.
By 1976, thirty percent of the Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today but its sharpness has been overtaken by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format was actually somewhat confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest overall ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS family of formats) have this aspect ratio equal to or very close to it.
The rule of thirds of the smile and laugh is a simple guideline for creating flexibility while maintaining a certain level of detail in the image.
The most effective place for the main case is to say that the image is at the intersection of the lines dividing the top and the diagonal into three (see illustration).
at this time in europe's history, the richest and most powerful catholic church came under scrutiny.
for more than a thousand years, christianity has united the great powers of europe despite their differences in language and culture.
its all-destroying power affects everything from the smallest to the greatest.
one of the main christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's treasury is specifically allocated to this cause.
the church's central authority was in rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money has led many to question whether its basic doctrinal beliefs were being fulfilled.
soon after the outbreak of hostilities, britain began to blockade the german navy.
Although the blockade violates generally accepted international law, codified in numerous international treaties over the past two centuries, the tactic has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain bombed international waterways to prevent any ships from passing through large areas of water, posing a danger even to neutral shipping.
Germany had the same expectation for unrestricted submarine warfare, as there was only one answer to the tactic.
in the 1920s, the dominant mood of many citizens and countries was antiwar and isolationism.
after witnessing the horrors and cruelty of war during world war i, the nations resolved to prevent such a situation from occurring again in the future.
In 1884, tesla moved to the united states to accept a job with the edison company in new york city.
He entered the U.S. with four coins, a book of poems, and a letter of thanks from Charles Bachler (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
ancient china had a unique way of representing the different periods of time, with each chinese rank or ruling family having a clearly identifiable dynasty.
the most famous of these was the three kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the han and jin dynasties.
in those times, there was a bitter war between many princes vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest period in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people fighting and dying for the top seat in the Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from realism to populism, nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
and after the revolution, the most coveted and successful careers were open to all male applicants.
the same is true for the military, because instead of being based on rank, the military rankings were now based on caliber.
the french revolution inspired the oppressed working class of many other countries to start their own revolts.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this ordinary life. He regularly went to meditate in a cave on Mount Jannur (Light) called Jirah.
The cave itself, which has survived its time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
resting on the top of a mountain north of mecca, the cave was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find someone even if you know they exist. Once you enter the cave, it is a total isolation.
The cave is a beautiful, clear, and beautiful place, and the view is spectacular. The cave is a beautiful, clear, and beautiful place, and the view is spectacular.
the great pyramid of giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that is still standing.
The great pyramid, built by the egyptians in the third century bce, is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains a number of pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
the great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh khulhu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and families of khulhu.

The distraught king louis xvi, his queen marie antoinette, their two young children (marie jesse, 11, and louis-charles, 4) and the king's sister, madame elisabeth, were forced to return to paris from versailles on october 6, 1789, by an angry mob of shopwomen.
They returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the king and queen.
A mob of rioters forced the windows of the king and queen's chariot to open wide.
on one occasion, a member of the procession was decapitating a royal guard who had been executed at versailles in front of the distraught queen.
US imperialism has paid the cost of the war to the Filipino people.
The Philippine government agrees to pay the U.S. government through Wall Street banks for the overhead and bond interest.
Indeed, the profiteers who exploited the vast Filipino population provide the US imperialism with fundamental benefits.
to understand the templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the formation of the religious group.
The period of time in which the events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries in European history (AD 10001300).
The high intermediate ages are preceded by the early intermediate ages and followed by the late intermediate ages, ending at the convention 1500.
Technology-obsessedness is a strong sense of the need for technology, or the need for technology, to think about the fate of humanity as derived from the fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and the revelation of technology.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has impacts on societies as they are created rather than social conditions.
For example, the motor car is said to necessarily lead to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network for small cars is not economically feasible, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Having more cars also increases the risk of accidents on the road, leading to the development of new technologies to repair damaged parts.
Romanticism was a large part of the cultural commitment of writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Sch√§gel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was better at shaping individuals and later geography-related cultures and societies into arbitrary rules that fit the place of the community.
just as paris was the fashion capital of the modern world, so constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal europe.
The reputation of being a luxury capital began in 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, it was less common for Christian warriors to return with gifts such as herbs and spices, which were valued more than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
early, the robe had a great influence on byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the deterioration of the communication routes, the lifestyles of the West may be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the middle ages, western europeans had begun to develop their own style of dress. one of the great developments of the war period was the introduction of the key to close clothes.
Sustainable agriculture means that the farmer has a crop that can only benefit him and his family.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple system of using simple, often organic, ecologically indigenous, stored seeds in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
historically, most farmers lived from hand to mouth, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel socially excluded and develop a sense of identity.
The internal cultures may differ according to the age, nationality, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be due to linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership in a unique and symbolic style of writing that incorporates fashion, etiquette, and slang.
One of the most common ways we explain the importance of social life is by looking at children who have grown up in poor conditions, injustice, or misery, and who have not learned to live with their foster parents.
Such children are called "ferals", or "scummies". Some children are shut out of the community (often by their own parents), in some cases because the parents do not accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Abandoned children may have suffered severe child abuse or emotional distress before they were attacked or fled.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, some said to have lived alone in the forest.
When non-human animals are fully developed, the feral will exhibit fully developed, unique insect-like traits (e.g., fear or indifference to humans).
While project-based learning needs to be made easy and interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support for individuals who are beginning a new learning process, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Summaries can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a way of summarizing, just as a small person would attach a sheet of paper to a Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended to ask, investigate and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse, and even theft.
No child should grow up in an environment that is careless, uncaring, and unteachable, but they will.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
foster care is supposed to provide all the essentials that were missing in the previous foster home.
The internet combines the features of the Internet and two-person communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet in terms of usage and satisfaction approach lead to additional dimensions.
For example, learning and socialization have been suggested as important drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
In addition, "personal engagement" and "continuous interaction" were identified as new motivational aspects in Igme and McCord (1998) 's study of audience responses to websites.
video recording has led to important breakthroughs in interpreting microseconds of facial expressions.
In particular, it is believed that by correctly interpreting the subtle-expressions, one can determine whether someone is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay, The President's Speech, shows how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can accurately assess sincerity.
He noted that these human-character skills could be shared by rodents, such as pet dogs.
twentieth century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the defined pool of variation.
The difference between the two pools with each generation of separation and reintegration controversy.
In the savannah, it is difficult for organisms with a human-like digestive system to meet the amino acid needs of the plant food sources found there.
Failure to do so also has serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources may have been proteins in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
in contrast, animal foods (worms, snails, eggs) are easily digestible and rich in protein, which includes all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in some way, much like the chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during a normal sleep period and then falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed across the room so that you can get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which may force a person to wake up for urination.
a person's inner peace is inversely related to the amount of stress in a person's body and spirit.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force will be. Everyone has the potential to achieve perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone has access to knowledge. The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan buddhism is based on the teachings of the buddha, but is extended by the mahayana way of love and many techniques from indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. Kundalini yoga involves immersion and an all-encompassing journey of love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (power of awareness) is activated through yoga postures, breathing movements, mantras, and visions.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Divine Yoga. Through the inspiration of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the light of knowledge is created in consciousness.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, forming an alliance between the USSR and the United States. By the end of the war, conflicts of order, process and culture had led the countries to collapse.
two years before the war ended, the cold war began, with former allies now enemies.
it would last for the next 40 years and would be the real battle on the battlefields from africa to asia, afghanistan, cuba and many other places.
On 17 september 1939, the polish defences had been broken and the only hope was to break through and reorganize the roman army.
But, these plans were foiled overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland's eastern regions to create the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Anti-Ballistic Treaty, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
shipping is the most efficient and effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The normal function of the navy is to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, and thereby disrupt the ability of your enemy to move people and goods.
One recent example of this worth writing about is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and goods across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly by using U-boats.
had the allies fallen, germany would have been able to take over the rest of europe, and perhaps britain.
goats were probably first domesticated in the zagros mountains of iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to expect milk, hair, meat and skins to be given to them easily.
Often the domestic goats were kept in herds roaming the mountains or other pastures, often as infants or adults, similar to the familiar shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
wagonways were built in england in the early 16th century.
although the carts only consisted of parallel tracks, they were pulled by horses to achieve greater speed and resulted in the towing of larger loads than on the slightly more difficult roads of the day.
The crusaders introduced the rails early on to keep them in place. gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more effective if they had iron over them.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the chariots.
In 1767 the first all-metal rails were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking, which began with the emergence of Homo erectus (a straight man) two million years ago.
the australopithecus, its predecessor, did not move straight.
Two-legged evolutions were found in the fossil body of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even advocate for some reduction of future suffering.
This is like symptomatic therapy in many cases. However, if we want only temporary solutions, then we have to find the root of the problems and destroy it.
It is well known that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the problems have increased due to the overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of humans.
After it passed the congress on july 4, a handwritten draft, signed by congressional president john hancock and secretary charles thompson, was sent to the printer, which then went through a few lines.
between 150 and 200 copies of what are now called the dunlap broad sides were made overnight.
The first public reading of the document was on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall at John Nixon.
One was sent to george washington on july 6, and he read it to his troops in new york on july 9. The copy arrived in london on august 10.
The 25 Danish highways that are known to exist are ancient copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many fossil researchers believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
but there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with teeth and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
today, almost all computers rely on the transmission of information encoded in binary code.

The symptoms, such as diarrhea, are general enough that they cannot be diagnosed quickly.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be an open medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the article for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
the term "mosquito" is the name commonly used by entomologists for a group of insects.

the couple may choose to plan for the adoption of their child.
In adoption, parents give up their parental rights to have their children raised by another couple.
the ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. this method actually leads to the most scientific research.
But not alone, experimentation, and testing is a test used to rule out one or more errors, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
naturalists and philosophers turned to classical texts, especially the latin bible.
Aristotle's views are accepted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
as greek knowledge declined, the west became alienated from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many processes observed in physiology and behavior are often largely determined by the existence of biological cycles and their productivity on biological clocks.
Seasonal convulsions that do not respond readily to external seasonal cues have been recorded for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, which maintain a free-spinning cycle time even in the absence of external signals.
the hersh and chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that dna was genetic material.
harshy and chase used either bacteria or viruses to insert their own dna into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling DNA phages with radioactive phosphorus or protein phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and the gene-line cells of the affected cells.
only mutations in cells of the germ line can be passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
nature based tourism is a form of tourism that involves people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the flora and fauna, including wildlife.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about its ecosystem.
An example is learning about, visiting and photographing Organychvans in Borneo.
people drive to work from small rural towns every morning and are passed by people who have left their workplaces.
In this dynamic transportation vessel, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this huge carbon economy has rejuvenated the biosphere from the stability that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Almost everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, sometimes the same complaints are heard about water quality and collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems bring such complaints, why do they fail every day? Does it mean that transportation engineers are not qualified enough? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a relatively consistent range, so traffic flows have a certain relative consistency and can be represented mathematically approximately.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections will help in the planning, design and execution of road utilities.
insects were the first animals to take to the air. their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies easily and to find food and a mate more efficiently.
most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward.
This gives them a wide range of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only creatures that cannot fold their wings back are water turtles and mayflies.
thousands of years ago, a man named aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
while some thought it was true, many believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because the earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The amazon river is the second longest and largest river on earth. it holds more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
the amazon is also the world's largest river, sometimes six miles wide.
the entire 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the amazon.
the main amazon river is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. it collects water from thousands of smaller active rivers.

the vatican city is almost entirely roman catholic.
Humans have known since ancient times about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, all of which can be found in nature and are easy to mine with ancient tools.
the philosopher aristotle theorized that all matter was composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
this is like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he proposed that they transform into new elements to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals, such as silver and gold.
and alloys may include non-carbon elements such as carbon steel.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
so when the pencil was released, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing styles emerged, the pencil was reduced to a small size and uses.
People now type messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a cameraman.
When something new comes along, one can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard.
The bomb works by gathering all the energy of protons and neutrons into a nucleus.
It recharges the nucleus and releases some of the energy.
some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to separate with little or no contact.
the moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
the rim is 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
The base of the marsh is thin and the base of the hill is thick.
There may be a lot of maryland nearby because the crust is porous. It was easy for the lava to rise.
current theories focus on finding what attracts people.
these theories suggest that as people grow into adulthood, they have certain needs and/or desires that are built into them.
These theories are about what makes certain people want to do certain things and what makes certain things in their environment do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the Maslow hierarchy of interest theory and the Hertzberg duality theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start managing their former peers, two things can happen: one is that they try to remain one of the men.
This type of supervisor has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making performance evaluations, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end, one turns to an anonymous individual who feels they have to change everything the group has been doing and do it on their own.
in any case, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
this behavior often causes friction between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are equipped with the same advanced levels as conventional groups, but with subtle differences.
virtual team members serve as a point of contact for their close physical team.
They are more often self-managed than normal group members and meet in different time zones that local managers may not understand.
The existence of a real occult group (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinctive feature of the virtual group.
The invisible team is a management team with each member reporting to it. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? It is a creative approach to putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice.
If all available resources are used properly in the functional units of the organization, innovation and intelligence will stand out.
As a result, an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovation process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization becomes innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the continuum approach that the institutional approach has been used to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive testing. It thus narrows the scope of research and makes it more accurate.
The link between psychiatric research and behavior helps researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, trauma and internal inflammation affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes in ways never before seen.
This gives us a wealth of data and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Despite the strong observation of the science fiction, AI is an important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate systems, which are focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are integrated into many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, her teacher will take her students to places where buses are not available.
Technology provides the solution from a virtual field trip. Students can appreciate fine art by viewing museum artifacts, visiting their aquarium, or sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences for future lessons.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year, but existing versions are kept online for reference.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with slurred grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to work on improving the articles to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to learn more about the world around them". The importance of catering to the audience's needs motivates students to be creative and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to do well academically beyond the normal school day.
The proper use of blogs "encourages students to be critical and critical, and by actively responding to online educational materials, students can express their views on other publications and express their own views on certain issues (ORAVEC 2002).
