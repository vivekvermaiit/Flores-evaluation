Although an experimental vaccine has been found that can reduce the death rate from Ebola, no drug has yet been shown to be effective in treating an existing infection.
The ZMapp antibody cocktail initially showed promising results in this area, but official studies have shown it to have less of a benefit in preventing death than previously expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control level, meaning that the researchers used it as a baseline and compared it to three other treatment options.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely held theory, but it also provides details that are not normally obtained from fossil remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brownish-brown on top and pale or carotenoid-pigmented on the underside.
The find also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rod called a rachis, but still have other distinctive features - beards and whiskers - researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved later by the evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display, and the researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen represents adult plumage rather than the plumage of a chick.
The researchers hypothesized that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, this specimen has the plumage of an adult rather than the plumage of a chick.
A car bomb was detonated outside the Gaziantep police headquarters in Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The sum of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the Rossby number of the star associated with the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the inversions of the magnetic field.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, much of the dark matter around the galaxy is arranged in a halo and is made up of a large number of small particles.

In a study conducted in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa , Dr. Tony Moll discovered XDR-TB , a disease that is extremely resistant to drugs .
In an interview, he said that the new strain "is of very great concern because it leads to a very high mortality rate".
Some of the patients could have been infected in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were health care workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multidrug-resistant TB in the entire TB population still seems low; 6,000 of the 330,000 people infected at this particular time in South Africa.

In France, voting is traditionally done with low-tech methods: the voter closes in a booth and puts a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law is quite rigorous in its systematization of procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes have been added to them other than those of people who have been allowed to vote and whose votes have been properly counted.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision in accordance with a special procedure.

Although there were three people inside the building when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adecco was subsequently charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and a trial, but any testimony could be distorted as her popularity has been widely used by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of the photos potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be really on the edge of their seats when they publish photos and other information about suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until the indictment is issued.
The document, according to the leak, will address the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the start of the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly touched upon include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters who took part in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was supervised and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Through a partnership between NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage conservation for the Wildlife and National Park Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Martei brought to the oath a new Provisional Electoral Council (VEC), consisting of nine members.
This is Marteias fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There were about 60 cases of faulty iPod overheating, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 radiations associated with these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In response, the ministry called the delay in Apple's report "very regrettable".
At 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday) an earthquake occurred in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are presumed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman as she went to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Liggins worked at the hospital, in his spare time, he began investigating cases of preterm birth.
His research showed that if the hormone is injected, it increases the maturation of the baby's lungs during fetal development.
State investigators found two onboard typewriters, or "black boxes", on Wednesday, Xinhua reports.
The wrestling team also paid tribute to Luna.
Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "Moona became the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. She passed away on the night of the two moons. It's a unique event, just like she is. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "The moon was as plague-ridden as I am... perhaps even more plague-ridden... and I love it and I'll miss it... and I hope it's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The poll showed that 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness is now in doubt.
He was unable to take the medication necessary to relieve the pain, as it is prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been the source of water that was brought to Earth, as well as the source of organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, because comets have been colliding with Earth for a very long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen  is a system that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite technology instead of the old technology based on ground-based radar, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
There is no additional transport to Wembley, no overground trains will stop there, and there are no surface parking and intercepting parking.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have led to speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that because of the mating of the endemic Darwin's hedgehog (Geospiza fortes) with the migratory cactus hedgehog (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, and it can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be braided and plated, and it can be beaten or rolled into rolls.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, called "face-painting".
This is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make an indicator with the juice of the red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of hydrogen ion saturation (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
Hydrogen ions  are protons that have electrons separated from them (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders in a container to make a new mixture, and then with clean, wet hands, mold the balls from the mixture.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which is unusual, and then a shell-like structure will form.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
Fragments of sewerage systems have been found in houses in Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere is distorting our light and our view to some degree.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed our world in incredible ways, and the most important thing it has done for us is it has given us a much easier and faster way to get around.
It has given us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them are more medium-sized cats, which eat small prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including stray domestic cats) eat and hunt many smaller animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job that each cat species does that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride consists of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behave very much like wolf or dog packs - animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behaviour and are also very dangerous to their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like the shouting of sentences of unreadable words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they have the opportunity, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track animals and find prey by scent, tracking its movement on the ground by means of their sense of smell.
They have excellent night vision and can move almost unnoticed, so they track their prey, blend in with their surroundings, and then attack.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from the ones it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all -- it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that you can't say they're the same species.
We call this process species formation, the emergence of new species, and species formation is a necessary consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants feed off the sun by photosynthesizing, and they also cast shadows.
We build our homes and we make our clothes from plants, and most of our food comes from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared no one but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus an extra row of teeth in its beak, so that those who came in its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue, and it ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus would not have been able to match it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did have their own strange and unusual dishes served at feasts, such as boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called the solea.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate sitting down on chairs, the rich enjoyed a communal feast, during which they ate lying on their sides.
Ancient Romans could not have included in their diet the foods that would have been introduced to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main shrine to each god, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to please the gods by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, as elements of the temple, special towers in the form of pyramids called "zikkurati" were built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was of little consequence.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open shelves facing the street; and stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so the wood was extremely expensive.
The Norse sagas tell of Erik the Red being banished from Iceland for murder, and moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it a name.
But regardless of its discovery, the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "Treasure of the Nation", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map.
Although it says something on the back, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads, "This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence this large parchment document (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was folded for convenient storage.
So it's likely that the entry was added as a mere footnote.
Operation Neptune and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
It was run by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of opposing them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion that became known as Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, Free French and American forces had liberated southern France and moved toward Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture, the bearers of which are a sufficiently large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning "civil" and is a cognate of the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also expresses in a certain way the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a continuous cultural presence and a continuous spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, formed a weak central government for the first time, with Congress as the sole organ.
Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the power of the states, which often refused to cooperate and to enforce all its acts.
He also had no authority to override state tax laws and tariffs.
Amendments to the Articles require the unanimous approval of all the states, but the states have been so irresponsible to the central government that their representatives have often been absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with Germany, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
Taiwan's history goes back many years, to the 15th century, when European navigators passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of aboriginal grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Rooms.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still photographs in the world is 35mm, and this was the dominant film size at the dawn of the analog era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the size of digital camera images.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio with small integers) is therefore taken as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The all-too-common and often-ridiculated rule of thirds  is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain amount of order in the image.
It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, as it grew rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European nations despite differences in language and traditions.
Her all-pervasive power touched everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist for that very purpose.
The church's center of power had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this doctrine had been observed.
Soon after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade has violated universally accepted international laws, as set out in several international treaties over the past two hundred years.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the reaction to this tactic was muted, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unimpeded underwater warfare.
Among most citizens and peoples in the 1920s, such sentiments as pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
After learning about the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America, and accepted an offer to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who was his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used a unique way of marking time periods; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce military actions between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for a place on the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the work opportunities opened up to all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true in the military, because ranks are now based on merit, not origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressive working-class representatives in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in subjects outside of this world, and he often visited the cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light) for meditation.
And the cave, which has survived to this day, gives us a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on a mountain top north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's very difficult to detect, even for someone who knows it exists, and in a cave, you're completely isolated.
You can see nothing but a clear, beautiful sky above you and the many mountains around you, and from deep inside the cave, you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid of Giza being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and relatives.
The upward movement of the arrow is represented by a V, and the downward movement of the arrow by a , which is represented by a bracket or a square without a bottom.
"Up" means you should start at the tip and bring the bow forward, and "down" means you should start where your hand is holding the bow and bring it back.
Moving the bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while moving the bow downwards  is stronger and more forceful.
You can draw your own bar, but remember that the bar is printed for musical reasons, and it's usually the one to follow.
On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, 11 and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military costs of American imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for much of the cost and interest on the bond loans that were being moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.
Of course, the super-profits brought by the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led them to form the Order.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term covering a wide range of practical ideas, from technical progress or technological imperative to the strict view that human destinies are driven by a fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technology development is virtually uninfluenced by cultural or political influences and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties, not by society.
For example, you could say that the automobile is the necessary cause of the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically disadvantageous to only a small group of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars is also leading to an increase in road accidents, which is leading to the invention of new treatments for injuries in health care.
Romanticism largely incorporated cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, it shaped customs and culture that were better suited to the place of residence of a society than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began about 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, valued higher than those offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this point that the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25-30 years.
The style developed in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages, and one of the great achievements of the time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Natural agriculture  is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often organic, farming system that uses seeds from plants growing in a given ecosystem, along with the use of crop rotation and other relatively simple methods to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have been farmers for a living, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel they've been pushed around by society's standards, and allow those people to define who they are.
Differences between subcultures may be due to the age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people who make up the subculture.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a particular subculture often declare their belonging through the idiosyncratic and symbolic use of style, including through fashion, mannerism, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several regrettable cases where children, due to lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse, have not had contact with adults during their adulthood.
Some of these children were isolated by humans (usually their own parents), and in some cases, this was the result of parents' rejection of their child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Street children may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before they fled or were abandoned.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he is raised entirely by animals instead of humans, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of physical limitations) that are virtually identical to the particular animal that raised him - for example, his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be easier and more fun, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding  is not a method of learning, but rather a form of helping those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the Microsoft Office Snippet.
The virtual learning scaffolding is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that a learner might find too difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never grow up in an environment where they are not provided with nurturing, care and education, but they do grow up.
We believe foster care is safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Patronal upbringing should provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scale in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, it has been suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "long-term contacts" were also named by Amy and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions  facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their micro-expressions.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks described how people who have brain damage and are unable to understand speech can still correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
He hypothesized that animals, such as domestic dogs, might have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of variations that are present.
Segregation and recombination with each generation blur the variations between the two pools.
In the savannah, primates with a digestive system like ours have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs with available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences, such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and beans, but they're poorly digested by primates like us if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, egg) are not only easily digestible but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
So, with all of this in mind, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (such as water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which causes the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force within you, and every human being has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
The kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods, which is a way of purifying energy channels, activating chakras, and achieving enlightenment of consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war, the contradictions regarding the system, process and culture led to strife between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, fighting in the real world, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places around the world.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian beachhead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight when some 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after capturing eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across oceans.
The job of a sailor has traditionally been to ensure that a country can move its people and goods, and at the same time prevent the enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Company during World War II, where the Americans were trying to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly its submarines, tried to stop the movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for themselves to have milk, wool, meat and skin on hand.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by a goat herd, usually children or adolescents, similar to the more common activity of a shepherd.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the paved roads were just parallel timber logs, they allowed horses to carry larger loads at higher speeds than the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Slabs were used for a long time to hold rails in place, but it was later found that the tracks were more efficient with an iron track on top.
This became the accepted practice, but the iron caused the wooden wagon wheels to wear out more.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans began walking as early as two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
For their ancestors, the Australopithecus, uprightness was not so common.
Bipedal specialization is found in the Australopithecus fossil from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally conscious lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate some of the suffering that's still going on.
It's usually like treating the symptoms, but if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically as a result of man's scientific and technological advances, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles have added to the problems.
After Congress passed it on July 4, the manuscript draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent several blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
150 to 200 copies were made overnight, now known as the "Dunlap leaflets".
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read before his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and survived to our day, and we call them birds.
They're often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's a lot more to be said about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a T. Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits"  or "bits" if you use computer jargon.
It can be difficult to detect oral poisoning at first, as symptoms such as vomiting are too common to diagnose quickly.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be an open container of a medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
The term comes from the bed bug, an insect that has been known since ancient times to parasitize humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species, adapted to living in the nest or the home of their host.
There are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making MS the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method, which is actually the basis of most scientific research.
Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to autonomously cycle over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into the bacterium using phages, which are viruses.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus and the radioactive grey of the phage protein.
Mutations can produce a large number of different outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is for those who like to go out into nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to work, and those whose workplace is in the place they just left pass by.
In this active transport movement, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the personal car-based transport system.
Now science is showing that this huge hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems, and virtually everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do we get so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they fail every day, are transportation engineers just incompetent, or is there a more fundamental reason?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of traffic flows.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study the intensity of traffic because you can't predict the behavior of a driver with a 100% probability.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some systematicity and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the transport flow, the relationships between three main quantities were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them evade predators, find food and mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This gives them more places to hide from predators.
The dragonfly and the hoverfly are the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Many believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes measuring six miles across.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans flows from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
In the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments created by their predecessors over a thousand years ago.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
People have known since ancient times about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as they are all found in nature in pure form and relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that they would change to a new state to produce what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil lost its status and became less useful.
Now people are typing messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard as more new technologies come along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to have many protons and neutrons in one nucleus.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, so the fission of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km  under the continents.
It's thinner under the moonlit seas and thicker under the hills.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible side because the crust is thinner there, and the lava was easier to get to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what makes people act or what might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate internally as they grow up.
These theories address what makes particular people want to do what they do and what makes their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are the Maslow's pyramid of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation.
There are two types of behavior that can occur when managers start managing people who are previously their equals: One extreme of the spectrum is trying to remain "their guy" (or "their girl").
Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to impose discipline, to evaluate work results, to allocate responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels like he has to change everything the team has done and take it for himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of skill as regular teams, but there are some slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to be more autonomous than employees on traditional teams, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each participant reports. The invisible team sets the norms for each participant.
Why would organizations go through the time-consuming process of creating a self-learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently across all functional units of the organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
Ultimately, the organization's collective efforts to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that is in the best interest of the customer.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and experience building.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
The data from neuroscience provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, and so it narrows the field of study, and it becomes much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors in the brain affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of data and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, looking at machine behavior and learning and "implementing" intelligence into them.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples of what we can do: monitoring, scheduling and scheduling, responding to client diagnoses and questions, and recognizing faces, handwriting and voice.
These questions are divided into separate disciplines, which aim to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
Currently, AI systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
School field trips are very important for any classroom, and very often teachers want to take their students to places that can't be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can visit a museum, an aquarium, or a beautiful piece of art while sitting in a classroom.
Putting the excursion online for everyone to see is also a great way to refresh the memory of the excursion and share what you learned with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year, this website is updated, but the old versions are still accessible -- they serve as a memory album.
Blogging can also improve students' writing skills, and although students often start their blogs using sloppy grammar and spelling, this tends to change due to audience participation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, by blogging, "students begin to understand the world around them better". Students are inspired to be smart and interesting by attracting the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that motivates students to extend their learning beyond the traditional classroom.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online materials, students can define their own position in the context of other people's work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful bilingual capital, with a wealth of art galleries and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muscoque and the surrounding areas.
All of these and more make Ontario truly Canadian to foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are virtually uninhabited.
An amazing demographic comparison: There are more African Americans in the United States than citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the others and is a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered a route across the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: All tourists are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not too expensive in appearance).
Women should be aware that because of cultural differences, they may feel that they are being harassed, that women are often persecuted, that they are being held by the hand, and so on.
Be firm in your rejection of men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Ed-Dar-el-Beyda, and Spanish merchants who established trading bases there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as crockery, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but all for tourists.
Goma  is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a safe place, it is important to check in advance about any travel outside Goma to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
It is also the starting point for the climb of Nyiragongo volcano, and one of the cheapest rates in Africa to see mountain gorillas in the wild.
You can travel around Goma by "bota-bota" (mototaxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic far-off land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger posed by desert sands.
One of the most important stops on the Henry Louis Gates PBS program "Wonders of the African World" was made here.
The city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by the Arab color rather than the African one.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of  19,500 km2; it has 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be the leading national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for visiting and guarding this park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows you to visit some or all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after the island of Hong Kong, a place that many tourists consider the main focus of their attention.
The chain of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering column diagram, highlighted by the waters of Victoria Bay.
To see the most beautiful sights of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head for the coast of the Julong Peninsula, which is opposite.
The largest urban development areas of Hong Kong Island are concentrated on the land on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, stretching from the coast 80 km (50 mi) inland in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres, of which about a third is covered by water or marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer now live in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable, and reliable Japanese Coaster buses.
The  route is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 knots) and Punakha (200 knots).
The Oiapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapok River and connects the cities of Oiapok in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapok in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.5 meters wide.
The height of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaran√≠ were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to various indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "vast province of the East Indies", was founded by Spanish conquistadors who clashed with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Ca√±itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched at other times of the year.
To find out about the news and where to buy tickets, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British Pound Sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the Falkland Islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures above +30¬∞C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb the animals.
The park's warning is to stay within 100 yards of bears and wolves and 25 yards of any other wildlife!
No matter how tame they appear, buffalo, moose, bear, and virtually any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please respect their privacy.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All but one British cruiser sank, and about 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of Tupua chief Tamseese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is situated on the shores of two harbours, and the most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbor area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and many are shaded by trees such as the pohu-tukava.
In central Oakland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers are located in the bay of Waitemata, the beaches of Tamaki Drive are spread out.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", which has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste.
There are many French wines that you can drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better transported.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still apprehensive, bottled water is not hard to find.
Australians don't understand the concept of flat white. Little black is an espresso, cappuccino is served with a high layer of whipped cream (not with foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and the fruit juices, although expensive, are of excellent quality.
There are a lot of trips to the reef all year round, and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the instructions of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cuckoo is found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April, though occasionally they may be encountered outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Crested crocodiles are not active in the ocean, and their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows the traveler to avoid worrying about where to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination package that includes a flight and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for the destination (e.g. visas).
Any changes or requests should be made first to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants stay overnight on the festival grounds, and most of them consider this a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be near the stage, you have to arrive early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be some areas of the festival where the music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin layout, as crossing the ice creates a rather eerie noise that can disturb the sleep of the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city tours, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (please specify conditions).
Usually, casinos make every effort to keep visitors as much time and money as possible, with no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to keep them in the hotel.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but drunkenness is mind-boggling, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive in a high-latitude area or over a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive like you would on normal asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get stuck can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall, blizzards, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice are normal in many countries, and traffic is almost continuous year round.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a staple for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday usage refers to a land journey to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants or giraffes, often get close to cars, so even with normal equipment, you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you'll see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush exploration, hiking safari, or walking safari) is a hike lasting from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympic Games twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you have booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a difficult situation.
The rules for cancelling orders may vary, but as of the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
A damp cloth ironing helps dry her out, and many hotels provide ironing boards and irons for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron or you're not thrilled with the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a fan if one is available.
Do not expose the fabric to too high a temperature (which may cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if in doubt, consider buying water from a trusted bottle and trusted company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they have not seen in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, secrete toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases in themselves or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods at certain points without taxes or excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on such goods as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fermon has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated, arid and wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on the alert: steep slopes, narrow alleys, and sharp turns are common.
The established speed limits are significantly lower than on the previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than the others.
However, oddly enough, the cell phone service here is much better than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria it is very plentiful and varied, and similar to that of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is widespread, apple pastry is available all year round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts are often used in German baking, and popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but filling flour confections, try what, depending on the region, are called pancakes or doughnuts with filling.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior of Pakistan and Northern India, yogurt is used extensively in curry, while coconut milk is commonly used in Southern India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catchall term used to refer to the huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without further specification, the term most often refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the greatest preference given to flavor additives such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle legs are the supports for the rider's legs, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there can be safety concerns, as there is a possibility of the foot getting stuck.
If a horse throws a rider off but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, the running horse may pull him back. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heeled heel, which have a smooth and fairly thin sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bows that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
At the top, you can enjoy the stunning mountain scenery, and rock climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its vast potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending on snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to feet.
Skiing is the main tourist destination for many ski lovers (sometimes called "ski bumpers") who plan their vacation around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings of skiers date back to as early as 5000 B.C.E.!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism is also known as backcountry, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related to, but usually does not include, hiking to the summit and then descending unprepared slopes, as skiing on the plain requires harder skis and boots.
Imagine that a ski trail is a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover a few more distances than walking, but you can only reach that speed on a cross-country ski in the rare case that you don't have a heavy backpack and have a ski rack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would require a visa application and multiple passport checks.
But the Schengen area is functioning as one country in this respect.
When you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through the passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, which saves you time and money and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are antiques, and some tax authorities define goods that are 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations, where the age limit in places like North America may be smaller than in Europe.
Craft items can be defined as antiques, despite the fact that they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important for many other professions.
Although this is the tradition, not all Saami were engaged in the mass reindeer breeding; they lived by fishing, hunting and other similar trades, using deer mainly as beasts of burden.
Today, many Sami people are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Gypsies, it is often considered offensive due to associations associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are going to visit has a travel advice, this may affect your health insurance during your trip or your cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult other governments besides your own, but their recommendations are directed at their citizens.
Here's one example: U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face situations that Europeans or Arabs cannot handle.
News reports only briefly describe the political situation in one country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, vague, and oversimplified in comparison with more detailed information that is widely available.
Adverse weather conditions (AMC) is a general term for any dangerous weather event that can cause damage, serious social upheaval, or human casualties.
Adverse weather conditions occur all over the world, and they come in different forms that depend on geography, terrain and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and forest fires are manifestations and effects of severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, water tornadoes, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal hazards include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to take into account any risks associated with severe weather in their area, as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo training.
A search on the Internet for the phrase "hostile environment safety course" might yield the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the topics covered in much more detail, often with practical training.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes rehearsal situations, a large amount of first aid information and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications on the battlefield.
People planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure that they have valid documents with them for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue gender-neutral passports (X) or documents updated with the desired name and gender varies from place to place.
The willingness of foreign governments to meet their obligations under these documents is also very different.
Surveillance at checkpoints also became much more rigorous after the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who are preparing for surgery should not be expected to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
A rip current is a current created by waves crashing against a shore, or sometimes a reef or something similar.
The backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas where a fast current can form, going to a greater depth, due to a similar underwater topology.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue while trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back won't be any harder than it usually is.
Try to go somewhere where you can't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning to one's home country is earlier than the culture shock (a shorter romantic period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who are able to adapt to a new culture can sometimes find it especially difficult to adjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your native culture's habits.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
It may be surprising to people that patience and understanding are also needed with travelers who have returned home.
The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most exciting activities in this area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in the silence before the show.
The history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres from the peninsula, the largest island is named after King George with the settlement of Villa-las-Estrelyas.
Others include Livingston Island and Decepcion, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano forms an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula merge with the plateau here, and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountain System, divided into two parts by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, the Sentinel Range, are Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Range, whose highest point is 4,892 m (12,980 ft) and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote areas outside of cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside in direct line of sight to a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including cruise and fast-moving vessels, where there is a need for remote data and voice communications.
You can usually get more information about how to connect to the service from your local telephone company.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take an academic year is to travel and study.
It's especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during your academic leave can actually improve your chances of gaining admission to higher education in your home country.
The cost of these courses is usually a tuition fee.
Finland is a great place for boating.The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You can do without a yacht when exploring the archipelago or visiting the lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and large lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks leave a very different impression.
Boating is a national form of leisure in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands it is between one and forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can spend several full days in this historic city and spend the night on the way back to the ship.
If you only go ashore as a boat tour, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany, as you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be intimidating for people of all ages and social backgrounds, especially if it's their first time flying or if they've had a traumatic experience in the past.
There's no shame in that, it's no different than the personal dislike and fear of other things that so many people have.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens in flight can help you overcome the fear that comes from the unknown or the inability to control the process.
Delivery services are well paid for their fast delivery times, and often the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs is critical.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies this was a problem.
If they were shipping something as air cargo, on some routes, unloading and clearing customs could take days.
The only way to get it out of the way faster is to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so we need your input.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for the privilege (or better yet, to get your company to pay for you).
However, it is not cheap - in our experience, you will pay four times more for business class than for economy class and eleven times more for first class!
Usually, there's no point in even looking for business or first-class discounts for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a hefty sum for the privilege of getting anywhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge a corresponding fee.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the victim of ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of about 3.7 million, the largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.

Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves.
Do not desecrate this place by scratching or placing graffiti on objects in the vicinity.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other public places.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians sound self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although it is often a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave in the best way possible as a "bien √©lev√©" (well-educated) person, which will make it much easier to adapt in this city.
The unwelcoming appearance of Parisians will evaporate if you show a little basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, fir and spruce, and is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the combination of microclimates, different soils and altitude differences, it presents a particularly wide diversity of plant communities.
The area is rich with a huge variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and deer, as well as many other common species, can be found here.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and with shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give clothes to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also bring them with you when you come in, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may feel uncomfortable in these skirts.
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread and meat (especially pork), with olive oil being used extensively.
A simple and popular lunch dish, especially in summer, is Pa-amb-oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available filling such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, meaning you, are always capitalized even in the middle of a sentence.
It's important to distinguish between verbs and adjectives.
This also probably makes it easier to read, while writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You should be especially careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.

However, people with a little knowledge of Spanish may be quick to conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it cannot be learned separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered obsolete today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses that are easier to access than those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of the sakura flower, called hanami, entered Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where the plum was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first celebrations of sakura blossoming were arranged by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.

It's a tradition to spend the Easter night, staying up, in some open place, to watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with parishioners usually beginning at midnight to celebrate Christ's Resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to these islands came here by swimming, flying, or being carried by the current.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not get there, making the giant tortoise the main herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans, many mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you'll know what a polar night is, when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be more or less dark all day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and as a result, light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or by position.
