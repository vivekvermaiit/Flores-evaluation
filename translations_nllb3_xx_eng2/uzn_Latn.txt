Not only does this support an already popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had hair, but it also provides details that fossils usually can't, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's upper legs were brownish-brown, and its lower legs were pale or carathenoid.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed feathery structure called a rachis, but other features of feathers - beards and feathers - led researchers to conclude that rachis was probably an evolutionary development that came later than other features.
The structure of the feet suggests that they were used for temperature control or reconnaissance, not for flight.The researchers believe that although this is a young dinosaur's foot, the specimen shows the adult's hair, not the chick's foot.
Researchers believe that although this is the remains of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an older species, not the feathers of a chick.

Most of the work was theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations in the Milky Way.
The effect the team is looking for is caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon affects the Earth by gravity, creating tides, the Milky Way affects the Milky Way by gravity.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is contained in a chamber around the galaxy, and is made up of many tiny particles.

Voting in France is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a statue, place a pre-printed piece of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
French electoral law codifies these processes much more rigidly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes were present at the beginning and that no envelopes were added except for those of voters appropriately numbered and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process, and at night, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following special rules.

Although there were three people inside the house at the time of the car crash, none of them were injured.
But the driver had a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed when emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of his son.
He will be held in custody pending indictment and trial, but any evidence from witnesses could be misleading, as his picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of the photos to be controversial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said that "it seems like journalists are really on a dangerous path when they're publishing photos of suspects and stuff".
The Crown Office, which is the prosecution's lead prosecutor, said it would not comment further to the press, at least until the indictment is complete.
According to the leaked documents, the document refers to a Palestinian-desired border dispute based on borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
The future land of Jerusalem, considered sacred by both nations, and the Jordan Valley are said to be involved.
Israel demands that it maintain regular troops in the valley for ten years after the treaty is signed, while the PA agrees to keep such troops for only five years.
Due to the monitoring of the test and the evaluation of its effectiveness, the shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by guards.
NPWS and the Sports Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. have partnered with the Sports Shooting Association to recruit skilled volunteers for the sport's shooting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage with the NPWS, the four mercenaries selected for the initial firing practice had undergone extensive safety and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday before the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a series of measures designed to steer the state toward new elections.
Martelli responded with a commission to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
In some cases, the strongest protests have been caused by the failure of elections, some of which had been due since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod hot flashes, causing a total of six fires and four minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which Apple called "not serious".
The minister responded that it was "really unfortunate" that Apple had delayed the report.
The quake struck at 07:19 local time (TO) on Friday 09:19 GMT in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of any casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, Philippines, and held them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the hikers with his M16.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, like the Filipino hostages.
And the old lady needed to go to the bathroom, so the cartoons took over.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the medical field.
She trained as an acupuncturist and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone is injected, it accelerates fetal lung maturation.
According to Xinhua, government investigators recovered two "black boxes" of flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Her fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Drimer says, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on a rare two-month night just like her.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as desperate as I was...maybe more so than I was...I love her and I miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
In the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic rose from 1,400 in a survey to 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed said they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The most striking of the poll's findings was that 29% of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle events and three Commonwealth Games relay races, but her health was in doubt due to her complaints.
He couldn't take the pain medication he needed because it was banned in the game.
Mathematician Curtis Cooper, a professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever on January 25.
In early February, several people using various hardware and software confirmed the discovery, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply to Earth, along with organic matter that could produce proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth formed, because comets have collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.
He calls gossip "political philosophy and ignorance", .
In 2016, he is expected to run for president.
The FAA claims that NextGen  is a system that allows aircraft to fly short distances and save millions of gallons of fuel and carbon emissions every year.
It uses a technology based on satellite, unlike older radar technologies, to allow air traffic controllers to better identify aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no additional transportation, and the subway trains don't stop at Wembley Station, and there are no parking lots or parking spaces.
The fear of transportation shortages made it more likely that the team would be forced to play the game behind closed doors, without fans.
Thursday's edition of Science reported the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, but it was believed that this process would take much longer due to cross-breeding between Geospiza fortes, an endemic Darwin's bat, and Geospiza conirostris, an immigrant cactus bat.
You can give gold any kind of shape, you can give it a very small shape.
You can pull it into a thin wire that can be twisted and folded, you can beat it with a claw, or you can turn it into sheets.
It could be made so thin that it could be glued onto another metal, so thin that it could be used to decorate the hand-drawn pictures in books called "decorated manuscripts".
This chemical is called pH, and you can use red cabbage juice to create an indicator.
The color of the carrot juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH (potential hydrogen) level is represented by the amount of hydrogen ions in the test chemical (pH is the hydrogen H in the potential hydrogen).
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball with a clean, wet hand.
It's strange how the moisture in your hand reacts with the outer layers to form a shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro has a flush toilet connected to a perfect sewerage system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, located in Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese had toilets, but in Roman civilization, they were part of a public bathroom, where men and women sometimes shared a bath.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite phone.
The satellite in space receives the call and then returns it almost instantly.
Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere can obscure some of the light and our vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket that's over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in ways that have never been seen before.
This has brought us the train, the car, and many other modes of transportation.
These include medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And of course, there are many other small felines (including domestic cats) that eat sweet prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of space - the special training that each cat has that keeps it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called packs.
A pride typically consists of one to three adult male lions, and more than thirty lionesses and cubs.
The progenitors are usually sisters or daughters of a large family, and are closely related to each other.
While lion packs behave much like wolf packs or packs of dogs, the animals (but not other big cats) are remarkably similar to lions in their behavior and also in their predation.
A versatile athlete, the tiger is capable of toe-climbing (though not very well), swimming, jumping great distances, and pulling with five times the force of a human.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera), and these four are the only cats that can swim.
A tiger's roar is not a full-blown lion's roar, but more like a phrase of words spoken in a roaring, high-pitched voice.
Ocelots love to eat small animals, and when they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all of the animals that they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that oselots track and find prey by sniffing out where the prey is going.
Night vision allows them to see very well in the dark, and they can move silently, so they adapt to their environment while hunting, and then they chase and capture their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they move up a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily reproduce), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so they will need different characteristics or adaptations to be more competitive with the new population than was previously required.
The indigenous population has not changed much, and they still need to adapt as much as they did before.
As a population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can't be considered to be the same species.
And this process, which we call speciation, which is just the formation of new species, is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that they exhale (that is, when we exhale).
Plants make their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is from plants, and without plants, life cannot survive.
The mosasaurus was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
It has over 70 sharp, dagger-like teeth in its long jaws, plus an extra set at the top of its mouth, which means there's no escape for anything that gets in its way.
We're not sure, but it's possible that he had a language, his diet included turtles, big fish, other small animals, and he may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that fell into the water, even giant dinosaurs like T. rex.
Most of their food was familiar to us, but had nothing to do with the peculiar or unusual elements of a Roman banquet, including pigs, doves, quail, and a type of rodent called the sonia.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on the tables, the rich men liked to have banquets, where they sat on the side while they ate.
Ancient Roman cuisine cannot include the foods that were introduced to Europe in later centuries from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had never eaten corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, a central temple that was considered the house of the god.
People sacrificed to gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods by ceremonies and festivals.
Each synagogue had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Special pyramidal towers, sometimes called zikkuras, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home was not that important.
The Hebrew family spent most of its life out in the open.
Women cooked in their backyards; shops were just open shelves facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not extensively forested, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated, and in Norwegian folklore, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled from Iceland for murder and to have encountered Greenland while traveling west and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes at that time.
Although all of these countries are "Scandinavian countries", Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had many differences in their people, their kings, their customs and their history.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map on the back.
It's not a treasure map, although it says something on the back.
The Declaration of Independence has the words "Original copy of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" written on the back, which can be seen in reverse at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, early in its life, a large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for storage.
So it's possible that this was just added as a tag.
While the D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, the south was still not free.
It was run by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and marched toward Germany.
A civilization is a much larger group of people living and working together, a society with a common single culture.
The word civilization is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and in some cases the size of a society, and is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning citizenship.
City-states are the predecessors of countries, and civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, the preservation of long-lasting cultural traces, and the fair-weather preservation of the past.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, of which Congress was part, under the terms of the Confederacy.
Congress lacked the power to tax and had no national executive or judicial power, so it relied on largely uncooperative state agencies to enforce all its laws.
However, it did not have the authority to override interstate tax laws and tariffs.
Amendments to the Articles required unanimous consent from all the states, and the states took the central government so lightly that they often had no representatives at all.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national football team, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 auto racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the Nordic regions, among Italians competing in the Olympic Games and international games.
Japan (the largest is Honshu) has nearly 7,000 islands, making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often called an archipelago, geographically speaking, because of its cluster of islands.
The origins of Taiwan go back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by wrote the island's name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in local grain production practices and recruiting Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (16441912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (18941895), the government of China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three structures called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Houses.
Many of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of how they originally came to be.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common film format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue photographic film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit of a mix-up, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (the simplest integer ratio, divided by twelve) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or much closer to these aspect ratios.
The oft-insulted and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating excitement while maintaining the order of the image.
It says that the most efficient place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had attained wealth and power, came under intense scrutiny.
Christianity has bound European nations together for thousands of years despite differences in language and customs.
Its vast power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth is needed to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are used for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and resources has led many to question whether or not this rule is being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began blockading Germany at sea.
Although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international treaties of the past two centuries, the strategy was effective, as it disconnected vital military and civilian supplies.
The British even threatened small ships by laying mines in international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire sections of the ocean.
With a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a response that resembled its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing mood among many citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
During World War I, the people who saw the horrors and atrocities of war were determined to prevent similar events from happening again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
She came to the United States with a 4-cent bill in her name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family belonged to a specific dynasty.
There were also periods of provinces in the interregnum between each dynasty, the most famous of which is the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred between the Han and the Xin dynasties over a period of 60 years.
During this period, there were violent clashes between nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the throne in the lavish palace that sits in the city of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
This was also true for the military, because the ranking of the army was no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life, and he often went to the cave known as Hiro on the mountain of "Light" to meditate.
The cave itself, which has been preserved over the centuries, provides a vivid picture of the spiritual tendencies that Muhammad experienced.
Located on a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knew it existed, it's not easy to find.
There's nothing to see but a clear, beautiful sky at the top and many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Cemetery", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and other family members.
The "upper crossbow" looks like a V, and the "lower crossbow" looks like a square or a cube with the lower side omitted.
Up means you have to start at the end and pull the nut, and down means you have to start at the arrowhead and pull the nut.
A higher pitch usually produces a softer sound, while a lower pitch produces a louder, more intense sound.
Feel free to draw your own characters in pencil, but remember that the arrowheads are written for musical purposes, so they should generally be considered.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, along with a mob of people shouting and screaming threats against the king and the queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their chariots wide.
Once, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles in front of the Queen, who was in a terrible mood.
The cost of the war of the US imperialism in the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To cover the bulk of the cost and the interest on the bonds placed in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses, they were forced to pay tax payments to the US colonial regime.
And it is clear that the enormous profits from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people are the main source of income for US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The time period covered is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c. 10001300), in European history, collectively known as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages are followed by the Early Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages, which terminate, tentatively, around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological impulse or technological necessity to the rigid notion that human destiny is governed by scientific laws and the underlying logic associated with their inverse in technology.
Most definitions of technological determinism encapsulate two general ideas: that technological development itself is largely outside the realm of political or cultural influence, and that technology, in turn, is not socially conditioned, but rather has "impacts" in societies that are specific.
So we can say that a motorized car can correspondingly improve the roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also led to an increase in road accidents, which led to the invention of new ways to repair damaged bodies in health care.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, which was left over from writers like Goethe, Fixte, and Schlegel.
Romanticism held that geography shaped individuals, and that over time, geography shaped customs and cultures that were better suited to their place in society than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its popularity as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, largely because the Seljuks returned with more gifts than the Byzantine market could offer, such as silk and spices.
It was at this time that the fashion capital title was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
But because of the slow pace of communication, the Western style may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, as Western Europe began to develop its own style, one of the great developments of the time that resulted from the lateral movement was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
A natural farm is one that is only farmed to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsidiary agriculture  is a simple, often organic system that increases yields by using seeds that have been preserved in an ecological area or other relatively simple techniques, along with replacement sowing.
Historically, many farmers have been subsistence farmers, and in many developing countries, they still are.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms and who are able to develop a sense of self.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, geography, and/or gender of members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashions, behavior, and jargon.
Citing a small number of unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults as they grew up, through neglect, accident, or intentional violence, is a common way to demonstrate the importance of socialization.
Some of the wildest children are those who have been restrained by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of a child has been caused by the parents' disregard for the child's severe mental or physical impairment.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human creatures, a feral child will exhibit behavior (within physical limits) that is almost exactly the behavior of a pet, such as fear or indifference to humans.
When project-based learning makes learning easier and more fun, support extends beyond the boundaries.
The pool is not a method of teaching, but rather a support system for people who are experiencing a new experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The pools can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is the shape of a pools, but so is the little humanoid paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are built into the software and they're designed to ask questions, to help, to explain things that might be difficult for a student to do on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up without any kind of discipline, care, or education, but they do.
We think of the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, sustainable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care system should provide all the essentials that they might not have in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet embodies elements of public and interpersonal communication.
The peculiarities of the Internet lead to additional dimensions of its use and its approach to satisfaction.
For example, "education" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In their study of audience attitudes toward websites, "personal engagement" and "persistent engagement" were also identified as novel motivational aspects by Emey and McCord (1998).
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in interpreting micro-expressions and facial expressions over a period of several million years.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting small expressions, it is possible to tell whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately assess sincerity.
He even speculated that such abilities to interpret human behavior might have been adopted by domesticated animals such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and openly expressed pools.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and removes it from the pool of variation that selection has accelerated.
Segregation and recombination blend the variations between the two currencies with each generation.
Outside of the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human to meet its amino acid needs from existing plant sources.
And failure to do so can lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
Proteins in leaves and legumes would be the easiest plant sources to grow, but they're hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, creature foods (ant, termite, egg) are not only easy digestibles, but they also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problems" in much the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of spontaneously waking up from your usual sleep time and falling asleep after a short time (10×60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a clock that is a little quieter to keep you comfortable without waking you up completely.
If you're turning off the clock while you're asleep, you might want to put it in the other corner of the room, where you'd have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a urine driver) before bedtime, which will force you to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of physical and mental stress a person is undergoing.
The lower the intensity, the more positive the life force is, and the more each person can achieve total peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of enlightenment is our own tendency to become nervous and negative.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the many styles of Indian yoga.
In fact, Tibetan Buddhism is very cool, it's based on Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga is the practice of awakening the Kundalini Kshati (power of enlightenment) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The centerpiece of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, where visualizing various deities cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and creates an enlightened consciousness.
Germany was the common enemy that was the cause of the collaboration between the USSR and the USA in World War II.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the real fight was to be waged by proxy armies on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, from Afghanistan to Cuba and many others.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian Plattardom.
But when the Soviet Union's Red Army of over 800,000 troops invaded and created fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral treaties, these plans became obsolete almost overnight.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The role of the Navy is, traditionally, to maintain your nation's ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously impeding your opponent's ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic operations of World War II, when the Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this transport movement, mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies had not won, Germany would have invaded Britain, as it would have invaded the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them for their milk, wool, meat and skins, for easy access.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that grazed on hillsides or other pastures, often tended by goats that resembled the better known shepherds to the public, and were often children or adolescents, and these methods of husbandry are still used today.
Wagon tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were simply parallel wooden planks, they allowed the draft horses to achieve greater speed and to pull larger loads than the slightly uneven tracks of those days.
Railroad tracks were invented early, but it took time for people to realize that railroads were more useful if they had iron on them.
This became a common practice, but it also led to more wear on the wooden-washed wheels of the iron carriages.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first complete iron rails were produced.
The earliest known transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not typically move vertically.
Although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs seven million years ago, the specialization of bipedalism is found in the Australopithecus fossil of 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be proactive in reducing some of the suffering in the future.
It's often like symptomatic therapy, but if we don't want to just have a temporary fix, we need to find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is well known that the world has undergone great changes due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and that problems have been exacerbated by the overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles of mankind.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a copy of the manuscript, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was later sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are now called "Danlep Side Zambarak".
On July 8, the document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, read to the troops in New York on July 9th, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap Posters, which are still known to exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, most paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are still many dinosaur-like features associated with birds.
They have hair and nails on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
All computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called bits or binary numbers for use in computer jargon.
Symptoms such as vomiting are common symptoms that may not be immediately diagnosable.
A good example of internal poisoning is a drug or toxic chemical that is used in the home and left in an open container.
Check the special first aid instruction label for this specific toxin.
The term rabbit is used by ethnomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient familiarity with the glands that are so well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer whales and bed bugs are bad-mouthed, having adapted to live in their siblings' or owners' homes.
There are approximately 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the leading neurological disorder among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve fibers.
The study found that women were twice as likely to get MS.
A couple may decide that having children is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their children.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the parents end their parental rights, after which the other couple can become parents to the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which in fact has led to many other scientific discoveries.
But it's not just experiments, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to make an example, and to make observations that can also serve as a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers turned their attention to the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, are accepted.
As knowledge in Greece declined, the West became disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific foundations.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are due in large part to the existence of endogenous cycles and their regulation by the body clock.
Periodic rhythms that are not simply responses to external periodic signals have been documented for many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is an automatic generator that keeps the cycle running autonomously even in the absence of external signals.
The idea that DNA is the genetic material was one of the key assumptions of the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transfer their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, identifying both the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus and the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Mutations in only the germ cells can pass to the children, mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy nature, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
One example is to visit Borneo and photograph and study orangutans.
Every morning, as people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, they cross paths with people who have businesses where they just left.
In this dynamic transportation route, each person is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on their personal car.
Now science shows that this huge carbon economy has robbed the biosphere of one of its most stable states that has supported human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Almost everyone has complained about the transportation system, and I think that's a good thing.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints like this about the quality of drinking water or about broken bridges.
Why do transportation systems make such a fuss, why do they make mistakes every day?
Traffic flow  is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because it's impossible to predict the behavior of a driver with 100 percent accuracy.
Well, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be expressed mathematically approximately.
To better represent the directional flow, the following relationships were established between the three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help plan, design, and exploit the roadway.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to evade predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to spread their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a much wider range of small areas to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are dragonflies and mosquitoes.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think that's true, but most people believe the opposite, that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars) revolves around the earth.
It's perfectly reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching six miles wide in some places.
The Amazon River is responsible for 20 percent of all the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never surpassed by the Pyramids of Giza in terms of their size and technical advantages in construction.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors that were over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800 people, is the smallest independent state and the least populated country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by the majority of people in public office.
The Vatican City is all Catholic.
Because these are all naturally occurring elements in nature and relatively easy to mine with hand tools, people have known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things were made up of one or more of the four elements, which he identified as earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter, in that order: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they could change into new substances to make what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Matter is the basis of everything in the universe, and it's made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So, when the pencil first came out, it was a good friend for most people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing techniques, the pencil fell into a lower status and less common use.
People are now writing on computer screens, without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine what a keyboard would look like if something new was created.
A fission bomb works by using energy to assemble a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
And when you split the nucleus, you release some of that energy, and you release some of that energy back into the nucleus.
Some atoms have a non-static nucleus, which means they tend to decay with or without a small spark.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the shell is 70 kilometers on the side of the moon as seen from Earth, and 100 kilometers on the back side.
This Moon is shallower under the sea and thicker in the highlands.
There may be more magma nearby, because the crust is thinner, and it's easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what attracts or engages people's attention.
These theories suggest that by the time people reach adulthood, they have certain intrinsic needs and/or desires.
These theories look at what motivates certain people to do the things they want to do and what factors in their environment influence them to do or not do certain things.
The two most popular theories of interest in content are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Gersberg's two-factor theory.
There are two behaviors that can occur when managers in general start leading their former colleagues: one end of the spectrum is trying to be "one of the guys" (or "one of the girls").
They have trouble making bad decisions, disciplining, assessing performance, assigning tasks, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes a mysterious individual who thinks that the community should change everything that it has done and make it their own.
And ultimately, the leadership team is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
In many cases, this behavior causes friction between managers and other team members.
Virtual communities follow the same standards of excellence as real communities, but with subtle differences.
Virtual group members often act as a point of contact for their physical group.
Because their communities can meet in different time zones that their local governing system may not understand, they often have more autonomy than traditional communities.
The existence of a real "invisible community" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a distinctive component of a virtual community.
The invisible team is the management team, where each member is accountable to the other, and the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an educational organization want to go through a process that takes so long to organize?
Creativity and innovation can emerge when all available resources in the functional departments of an organization are used effectively.
As a result, an organizational process that works together to overcome a barrier can trigger new innovative processes that serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must establish a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational training.
Angell (2006) explains the contiguous environments approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neuroinformatics provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and therefore narrows the field of study and makes it more specific.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is supported by research from scientists who have studied the brain.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, lesions, diseases, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions.
The development of new technologies has allowed us to see and study the structure and functioning of the brain in ways that had never been observed before.
This provides us with a wealth of data and material to use to create simulation models that can help us understand the workings of our minds.
While AI has strong science fiction connotations, it is a very important area of computer science that deals with behavior, machine learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research is about creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to control, plan and schedule, respond to client diagnoses and questions, and recognize handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
Things like this that are focused on solving real-life problems have become separate sciences.
AI is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in many home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are a big part of any class, and very often, a teacher wants to take their students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours of the site, where students can sit in their classroom and view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or engage in a piece of fine art.
Sharing virtual excursions is a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their annual trips to the state capital, which is remodeled annually, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills, and while students often begin their blogging experience with a sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger will try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "encourages students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them".[22] The need to satisfy curiosity in the classroom inspires students to be more observant and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool to inspire collaboration and motivate students to expand their knowledge beyond the traditional day of school.
Proper use of blogs "enables students to become better analytical and critical thinkers; by actively responding to online materials, students are able to establish their own position in the context of others' writings, as well as articulate their own point of view on specific issues". (Oravek, 2002)
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, home to a number of art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's history and present.
And then there's Niagara Falls to the south, and Muskoka to the north, and beyond that, untouched natural beauty.
All of these and more emphasize that Ontario is seen by foreigners as typically Canadian.
The vast areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited deserts.
When you compare the populations, it surprises most people that there are more African-Americans than Canadians living in the United States.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of the African continent.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most distinctive isolated continent when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are associated with independent states or France, and they are popular as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam with them, and it was very influential in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female tourists, regardless of marital status, are advised to state that they are married.
It's also useful to wear a ring (just to make it look less expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to things that they perceive as harassment, and that being watched, being held by the hand, is not an uncommon occurrence.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for what you say (whether there are cultural differences or not doesn't make it a commonplace!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the 10th century AD and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meranids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the Old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as crowns, ceramics, leather goods, rugs, and various decorations, but they're all for tourists.
Goma  is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption, which turned the streets of the city, especially the downtown, into ash.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma should be explored to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.
The city is also a base for hiking to the Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla viewing in Africa.
You can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.The usual (local) price for short trips is  ~500 Congolese francs.
Despite its relative lack of accessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for distant, exotic lands.
Today, despite its reputation and the fact that it has an airport, Timbuktu is a poor town.
Due to the danger of sand dunes, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
This was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Guest's PBS special, "The Wonders of the African World".
It's a city that is very different from the rest of the country because it's more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Timsoh River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Scientists are working on a reactor that can produce energy in this way.
Buying a Wild Card that gives you access to select parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks can be helpful.
Hong Kong Island is the main attraction for many tourists, and it lends its name to the Hong Kong region.
The chain of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is likened to a grid with a bright streak, which is clearly visible due to the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, head off the island to the opposite side of the island, to the Kowloon beach.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated in the densely developed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonists claimed to be, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The largest coastline in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the Sandarban coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India, is a mangrove swamp.
Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The Indian part of the forest is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But forests are not just mangrove swamps -- they also contain the last remaining trees of the mighty mangroves that once covered the plain of Hindgang.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about one-third of which is covered by water/swampland.
Since 1966, Sandarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 mountain deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus stop (across the river) during the day, but most depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumtang.
Since the intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and robust Japanese cabotage buses.
Escort taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to places not too far away, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punaha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oyapock, Brazil, and Saint-Georges-de-Oyapock, French Guiana.
The twin towers are 83 meters high, with two aisles 378 meters long and 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 meters underneath the bridge.Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when construction of the Brazilian Customs Checkpoints is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the lands of what is now eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaykuru and the Payagua, who subsist on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indians", Paraguay was founded in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadors who clashed with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that would last three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams in the world and for having the best players.
In December, the biggest polo tournament of the year will be held in the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches are held here.
For updates on where to buy tickets for polo games and tournaments, contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the  Falklands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to one British Pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located across from the FIC West store in Stanley.
The British pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and Stanley credit cards and the United States dollar are also widely accepted.
While British and US currency is accepted, credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands; check with the owners in advance to see what payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so make sure to exchange the money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; it is not uncommon for temperatures to exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but combined wind and humidity can feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no separate "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild is definitely wild and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Buffalo, elk, moose, bear, and almost any large animal can be aggressive no matter how tame it may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals can be huge, wild, and dangerous, so leave them their territory.
Ivory also attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking spicy food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the harbor was the scene of a fierce naval confrontation when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and about 200 Americans and Germans were lost.
A peaceful demonstration in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement led to the assassination of Tupua's supreme leader, Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has a large number of beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas, because it surrounds two ports.
The North Shore beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devenport in the south.
They are almost entirely sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and many are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour in central Auckland, on the prestigious outskirts of the cities of Mission Bay and St. Heliers.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a row of shops lined up along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex profile beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are lots of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines might go better on the road.
Local tap water is perfectly safe, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're nervous.
The idea of a "light white" coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. "Espresso" is called black coffee, cappuccino is filled with cream (not with foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian, and the fruit juices are good, even though they're expensive.
Most trips to the reef are year-round, and injuries are rare on the reef for any of these reasons.
However, follow the advice of government authorities, follow all signs and take safety warnings seriously.
The red-bellied jellyfish is found in the north from October to April 1770, near the banks and the mouths of rivers, although it is occasionally seen at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are rare in the ocean, and their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give the traveler peace of mind by ensuring that they have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent, travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even flight and hotel services.
If you need time to present or obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can also order them for you.
All changes and requests should be sent through the travel agent first, not directly to the hotels.
For some festivals, a large percentage of music festival attendees decide to camp out on the grounds, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to get a camping spot next to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there may be parts of the festival where the music continues until midnight.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're going to cross the North Baltic in winter, pay attention to the cabin layout, because crossing through the ice can make a very loud noise, and it can affect some people.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city.Participants of the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos typically do a lot to maximize time and money spent by guests, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and it's difficult to find an exit.
They often offer special food, drinks, and entertainment programs to help keep guests entertained and entertained inside.
Some venues will serve alcohol on the premises, but intoxication can impair decision-making, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying alert.
Anyone who wants to drive a car on high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the temperature of snow, ice, or freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, you have a lower exercise rate and you can't move as easily as on normal asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall to be packed in a very short time.
Vision can also be limited by snow or a thunderstorm, or by condensation or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in most countries, and traffic is almost continuous year-round.
Safari is perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the most popular destination for many visitors.
The familiar term safari refers to a trip across the continent to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to be close to cars, and standard equipment provides good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better through binoculars.
A "walking tour" (also called a "walking tour", "walking tour", or "walking tour") is a walking tour of several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events also taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, making it the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you have booked flights and hotels for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation procedures vary, but the coronavirus-based cancellation procedures in late March meant that the Olympic Games would not last until July 2020, when they were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a standard ticket price of around ¥7,000.
Many hotels rent a crochet and ironing board, even if they don't have one in the room.
If you don't have a lace or don't like wearing lace socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you do.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are many different ways to purify water, some of which are considered to be more effective against certain hazards.
In some places, it takes a minute for the water to boil, in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their efficiency, so if you're worried, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter animal parasites that are unknown in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or cause infections.
Dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans either by their own contagious diseases or by force are generally not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain areas.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can save a lot of money in some cases, especially on items like alcohol and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont is often the most inhospitable to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, with the route often passing through desolate terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, beware: there are a lot of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and steep slopes.
The speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections  usually 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and adherence to them is more important than the others.
And what's interesting is that cell phone service is much better here than in many other areas, like the Pennsylvania Wild.
German pastry is very good, and Bavaria is much richer and more varied than its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apple pies available year-round, and cherry and flax pies available in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, watermelons, and other nuts, and popular dishes often go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries with milk, sugar, and fat, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a meat or vegetable-based food, along with herbs and spices.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of local dishes found throughout the country, due to the fact that there are 17,000 islands to choose from.
However, the term without additional definitions tends to refer to a dish that originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now common throughout the archipelago, consists of simple dishes with spices, the main spices that Javanese people love are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially the sugar derived from the Javanese coconut) and various aromatic spices.
The two horses are suspended on either side of the donkey, and the legs of the rider are supported by long supports.
They provide the rider with a more secure mounting, but can raise safety concerns due to the risk of the rider's feet being stuck to them.
If a rider is caught in a slippery slope and his foot is caught in the slippery slope, he may be dragged off the horse in the event of a run-off.
First, most riders wear a flat, narrow-brimmed equestrian boot with a low heel.
Also, some eels, especially the English eels, have a safety harness that allows their long skin to fall off the collar if they are pulled back by a falling rider.
The Coamo Valley  is the main climbing destination in Chile for the Yosemite of South America, a large wall of various granite and rock formations.
The peaks provide spectacular views from the highest points, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes through the endless possibilities of its walls.
Alpine skiing, which combines skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves surfing on snow-covered ground with a snowboard or snowboard attached to the foot.
