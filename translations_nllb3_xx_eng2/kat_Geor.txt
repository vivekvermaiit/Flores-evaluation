Although one experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the death rate from Ebola, so far, no drug has been clearly considered suitable to treat the current infection.
One antibody blend, Zmapp, initially looked promising in the field, but official studies have shown it to be less effective than expected in preventing death.
ZMapp was a control in the PALM trial, which meant that the scientists used it as a standard criterion against which to compare the other three treatments.
The United States Olympic Committee letter supports the United States in its efforts to end the practice of gymnastics and to endorse the Olympic family's categorical demand that all athletes be provided with a safe environment.
We agree with the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee that the interests of our clubs and athletes, and their sport, can be better served by making substantial changes within our organization, not by withdrawing certification.
The US weightlifting community supports an independent investigation that sheds light on the fact that, with so many victims of Larry Nassar's sexual abuse, the fact that this has gone unnoticed for so long, will result in all the necessary and appropriate changes.

This not only confirms the existing theory that some dinosaurs had a hump, but it also gives us details like color and information about three-dimensional arrangement that we don't get from fossils.
Scientists believe that this creature was reddish-brown on the upper surface and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery also provides a good way to study the evolution of the bumblebee in birds.
Since dinosaur blubber beetles don't have a well-developed jaw, or spine, but they do have other features of a blubber, such as a jaw and a tail, researchers suggest that the spine may have developed later than these other features.
The structure of the bulb suggests that it was used not for flight but for temperature control or as a gauge. Although the researchers assume that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen is an adult, not a winged, bulb.
Although this is a younger dinosaur tail, researchers believe that the bumblebee is more mature than the lizard.
Two police officers were killed and more than 20 others were injured in a car bombing at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, early yesterday.

It warns that no one can guarantee that no action in Iraq will stop the fanatical warfare, the escalating violence or the drive for chaos.
The report begins by calling for a debate and a consensus in the United States on Middle East policy.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the executive branch's current policy toward Iraq, and it calls for an immediate change of direction.
By the end of this year, a new diplomatic initiative to protect Iraq's borders from enemy attack and restore diplomatic ties with neighboring countries should be implemented, the first of 78 recommendations.

Public outcry has led to the development of sexual content policies for websites that host millions of openly licensed media.
Although the program was written to simulate observations of the Milky Way, the work performed was largely theoretical.
The interaction the team was looking for must be caused by kinetic forces between the invisible matter of the galaxy and the invisible matter of the Milky Way.
The Milky Way affects the dwarf galaxy in the same way that the moon's gravitational pull on the Earth causes the waves to form.
Scientists have finally concluded that dark matter, like ordinary matter, affects other dark matter.
The theory is that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is a kind of halo wrapped around the galaxy, and it's made up of many small particles.

In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, Dr. Tony Moll has discovered a form of tuberculosis that is highly resistant to drugs (XDR-TB).
"It is very worrying and alarming because of its high mortality rate", he said in an interview about the new strain.
Some of the patients, Dr. Mollie believes, were infected with infectious diseases in the hospital, and at least two of them are hospital employees.
An infected person can infect 10 to 15 people a year from close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire TB population is still low, with about 6,000 of 330,000 people in South Africa infected at any given time.

The government has also pledged several million doses of the encephalitis vaccine to help health organizations prepare for next year.
Plans to vaccinate the historically worst-hit areas have been delayed this year due to low priorities for measles and other diseases.

Infrared imaging shows that the temperature fluctuates day to day, and that these are probably caverns.
They're cooler to their environment during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not like the large caverns on Earth, which maintain a completely constant temperature but are stable because they are deep in the ground", said Glenn Cushing, a member of the USGS astrogeology team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Traditionally, the low-tech experience in France has been voting: Voters are isolated in a voting booth and put a pre-printed ballot paper, with their chosen candidate's name on it, in an envelope.
Once the official representatives have identified the voter, the voter will place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter list.
The French electoral law is quite strict on the procedures.
Since 1988, it was decided that the ballot box should be transparent so that voters and observers have the opportunity to make sure for themselves that there was no envelope in the box at the beginning of the voting and that no extra envelopes were added to it, except for those envelopes of those who were counted correctly and entitled to vote.
Candidates can send their representatives to observe all parts of the process. At night, under strict monitoring and following specific procedures, volunteers count the votes.

Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampram Kanjar, Gasa Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
Until the emergency services were able to remove the driver from the red Audi TT, the road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After this, he worked at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, accused of murdering his son, was then in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
He is in custody pending an indictment and trial, although any testimony from witnesses could be considered bad faith evidence after his identity was revealed.
In the UK, this is common practice, but in Scotland, the law is different, and the courts will consider the publication of the photos potentially harmful.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said that "journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which will handle the prosecution in its entirety, told reporters it would not comment, at least until charges were brought.
According to leaked information, the document concerns a dispute over the borders that Palestine wanted, within the borders that it owned before the 1967 war in the East.
The future state of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, a sacred place for both nations, are the next subjects of the report.
After the signing of the treaty, Israel demanded the deployment of troops in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to deploy for only five years.
In addition to the pest control test, the shooters had to be under the supervision of the Rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness had to be evaluated.
In partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first shot received full safety and training instruction.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday as a member of the new nine-member Council for Electoral Prevention (CEP).
This is the fifth temporary election board for Martell in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martel's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October was a commission.
Some of the violent protests were caused by the fact that elections have not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overcharging have been reported, of which 6 cases resulted in fire and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents involving the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Entrepreneurship said that Apple had notified it of 34 more payment incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
In response, the Ministry called Apple's delay in submitting the report "really regrettable".
The quake in Mariana occurred at 07:19 local time (Friday, 21:19 GMT).
No injuries were reported in the country, according to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency.
In addition, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, no signs of a tsunami were detected.
In the past, a Filipino policeman has kidnapped Hong Kong tourists, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been released and at least six people are confirmed dead.
The Filipino photographers were soon released, as were six hostages, including children and the elderly.
Since the old woman needed to use the bathroom, the photographers took her place.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She worked her way up to the position of midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of the lungs in the placenta of a baby was accelerated by the introduction of the hormone.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two black boxes containing flight information on Wednesday.
Luna's honor was honored by her fellow wrestlers.
Luna, the queen of extreme, was my first manager. Luna died on the night of the second moon, on a day as unique as hers.
Dustin Goldstein Runnels: "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe more so... I love her and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
In a poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the sitting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic after the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II.
The view that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch of Australia is held by 34 percent of those polled.
In extreme cases, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to the chicken pox, her fitness was in doubt.
He couldn't take his own pain medication because it's forbidden to use it in the games.
On January 25, mathematician and computer science professor Kurtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri announced the discovery of the largest prime number.
Using various techniques and software, several people confirmed the discovery in early February, after which the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water and organic matter that could have formed proteins and supported life on Earth.
Scientists hope to uncover how planets formed, and especially Earth, after being hit by comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed the same-sex marriage bill into law last month.
He called gossip "political hubris and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
As the Federal Aviation Administration says, NextGen is a system that allows planes to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions every year.
Unlike older ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology that allows air traffic controllers to more accurately determine aircraft movements and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no additional transportation, no trains stop at Wembley, and no parking is available in the area.
The fear of the lack of transportation led to the possibility that the game would be forced to be held behind closed doors without support.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Uppsala University in Sweden and Princeton University in the United States claimed that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process took too long, as it was a cross between the endemic Darwin's mound, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus-like mound, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape, and it can be worked into even smaller shapes.
It can be made into thin wire that can be twisted and bent, and it can be cut or rolled into sheets.
It can be highly thinned and bonded to other metals, and it can be thinned to such a degree that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books, so-called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make an indicator out of red compost juice.
The color of the juice changes depending on the acidity or the impurity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen (H) ions in the test chemical (pH).
Hydrogen ions are electron-paired protons (since a hydrogen atom is composed of one electron and one proton).
Mix two dry powders together and hold them in your hand and shape them into a ball with your clean, wet hands.
The skin reacts to the outer layers on your hands, which creates a fun feel and a certain texture.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mojenjo-daro had a laundry unit connected to a complex sewer system.
In Greece, in the cities of Crete and Santorini, Minos, the remains of sewers have been found in residential areas.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese also had baths. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths, shared by men and women.
You use a satellite to call people thousands of miles away.
A satellite in space picks up the signal and reflects it back almost immediately.
An artificial satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It carries a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in a way you can't imagine, and the best thing that the wheel has done for humanity is to make transportation much easier and faster.
He has given us many means of transportation, such as trains, cars, and so forth.
Below them are the medium-sized prey, ranging from ducks to antelopes to mammals, the medium-sized cat eaters.
Finally, there are many small feline family members (including domestic cats) that feed on much larger amounts of small crops, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche, which implies that each cat has its own special job, which prevents them from competing with each other, is the secret of their success.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats, and they live in families called prairies.
The pride consists of one to three adult male deer and up to thirty females and males.
The lion is closely related to the other and lives in a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pride behaves very similarly to the wolves or dogs, animals that also resemble lions remarkably in their manner of behaviour (but not other big cats) and are also highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger, a well-rounded athlete, can jump (not very well, apparently), swim, jump long distances, and swim with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (the panther family) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can bark.
A tiger's mouth sounds more like a sentence of words uttered in a roar than a lion's mouth sounds in full voice.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, reptiles, and birds, which are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the ocelot is a ground-dwelling animal that tracks and sniffs for prey.
With night vision, they see perfectly in the dark and move silently. The ocelots adapt to their environment and then attack their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is isolated from the main population (for example, if a small population crosses a mountain peak or a river, or settles on a new island and cannot easily return), it is often in a different environment than it has been in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need to develop new traits or adapt to become stronger competitors than the old.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As new populations begin to adapt to new environments over time, they become less and less like different populations.
Eventually, these two populations in a thousand or even a million years will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, and it's just the formation of new species. The formation of species is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (or exhale).
Plants get their food from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also produce shade.
We use plants to build our homes, we use plants to make our clothes, most of the food we eat is plant-based, and animals could not exist without plants.
The Mozazazaur was a predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mozazaur.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 incisors, and the upper part of its mouth had an extra set of teeth, meaning that anyone who tried to attack it would not be able to escape.
It may have had a tongue like a snail, but we don't know for sure, and it probably fed on crabs, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that went into the water, and it couldn't even compete with a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus rex.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had a number of strange or unusual dishes on the nadim, such as tahini, farshvangi, loquins, and one species of lizard called the silguda.
Another difference was that poor men and women ate their meals sitting on benches, while rich men preferred to eat together when they were pushed to the side of the table.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the foods that would be introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and Indian food were not available to any ancient Roman.
For each of these gods, the Babylonians built a central temple, which was considered the home of the gods.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' demands by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner altar reserved for the priests only.
Sometimes, ziggurats, or towers with a distinctive pyramid shape, were built as part of temples.
The tower's column was a special throne for the god.
The house was not so important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The Jewish family spent most of its life in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were open plan stalls right across the street, and houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan, timber was very expensive because there were no large forests.
Greenland was inhabited by hunters, and Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, as the Norman sagas say, and it was on his journey west that he discovered Greenland and gave it its present name.
But despite its discovery, the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Despite the Scandinavian nature of each nation, the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
In the case of the National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it's not. Although, there's something written on the back of the document, but it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence had the words: "Mother of the Declaration of Independence, Date: July 4, 1776". The text is in italics, at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows who actually wrote it, it is known that early in its creation a large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was prepared for preservation.
So it's likely that the record was just added as a joke.
The landings and subsequent fighting liberated the north of France, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, the French people who had given up in 1940 to work with the Germans instead of fighting the invaders.
The Allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940, an invasion operation called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a very large group of people, of people who live and work in cooperation, that's what society is.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means citizen, and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "city", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", which in some ways define the size of a society.
The ancestors of nations are the city-states. The culture of a civilization involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the preservation of a cultural footprint, and the equitable distribution of knowledge.
Many small cultures disappear without leaving a proper historical trace and without being recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, for the first time, the Thirteen States created a weak central government - Congress was its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on government agencies that often did not cooperate with others to enforce its acts.
It also had no corresponding power over interstate tax laws and tariffs.
Amendments to the Articles of Confederation required unanimous consent from all the states, and the states had such a dismissive attitude toward the central government that their representatives often did not attend the deliberations.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world. They won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey on ice skates, and F1 motor racing are among the popular sports.
In the northern regions, winter sports are most popular. Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), Japan is the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands, geographically Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century when European sailors sailed to the island and named it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan in 1624, initiating changes in aboriginal grain production and hiring Chinese laborers for rice and sugar plantations.
Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885 after the armed forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern coastal districts of Taiwan in 1683.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimoneseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was ruled by Japan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the  Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the banks of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
30% of Machu Picchu was restored in 1976 and is still being restored today.
For example, the most widely used still image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most common plate size at the end of the analogue plate era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio of the screen is derived from the image converter format of a digital camera.
The 35mm format, 36mm wide by 24mm high, can be more or less misleading.
The ratio of this format (which is divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore, as mentioned, 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format group) are equal to or close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often overlooked and ignored, is a simple guide to creating dynamics that maintain the order of the couples in the images.
It seems to be the most effective line intersection of the main subject, dividing the image into thirds, vertically and horizontally (see example).
The enriched and empowered Catholic Church became the subject of intense debate during this period of European history.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity united European nations for more than a thousand years.
His unlimited power, from the king to the common people, was the most effective.
The idea that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church collects money for this purpose, is a central Christian principle.
For a thousand years, Rome had the central authority of the church, and this concentration of power and money raised questions about how well this principle was being fulfilled.
Britain had placed a naval blockade on Germany as soon as the war began.
The strategy has proven effective, halting the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies. However, the blockade has also violated generally accepted principles of international law, embedded in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain had sealed off international waters to prevent ships from entering full sections of the ocean, which threatened neutral shipping.
Since this tactic had limited response, Germany expected a similar response in underwater warfare, which was not prohibited for it.
In the 1920's, the prevailing position among most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelty of war during World War I, nations wanted to prevent a repeat of that situation.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 and began working for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with a 4-cent bill, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a distinctive way of representing different periods; all periods of China and all families in power were part of a particular dynasty.
Also, there was a period of instability between each dynasty's rule, with provinces being divided. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At this time, fierce fighting was taking place between many of the nobles vying for the throne.
In ancient Chinese history, the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods, with thousands of people sacrificed to take the throne of the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the transition from absolutism to republicanism, the use of the metric system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, all male candidates were allowed to run for office, which allowed the most ambitious and successful people to advance.
Since military ranks, which were previously based on class, are now based on merit, this applies to soldiers as well.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in various countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life, and he frequently went to meditate in the caves of the mountain of Nur (Light) in Hira.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
It rests on a mountain ridge in the north of Mexico, where the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knew it existed, it's not that easy to find. Once you're in the cave, it's completely isolated.
You can't see anything above except the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and very little of the universe can be seen or heard from the depths of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to the present day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. to honor a deceased Pharaoh, is among the largest pyramids in the world.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a small tomb, a temple, and a large statue of a sphinx.
Pharaoh built a large pyramid to honor Khufu and many smaller pyramids, altars, and temples for Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper ascending sign looks like a V, and the lower descending sign looks like a stapler or a rectangle with the bottom side missing.
Up means you have to start at the base of the tree and go straight up, and down means you have to start at the base of the tree, where you hold the tree in your hand, and go straight up.
Bending the stem upwards usually produces a softer sound, while bending the stem downwards produces a stronger and more durable sound.
You can make your own notes with the keyboard, but remember that the printed notes have a musical meaning, so you have to be careful with them.
On October 6, 1789, the deposed King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and Madame Elisabeth, the King's sister, were forcibly returned from Versailles to Paris by a ring of surrounding market ladies.
They rode back to Paris in a chariot, surrounded by a crowd of people who were calling out threatening noises against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and the dauphin to open wide the windows of their chariots.
A member of the mob that attacked the king's bodyguard at Versailles at one point bowed to the frightened queen.
It was the Filipinos who financed the war of the United States of America's imperialism to conquer the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover the bulk of the cost and interest of the bonds they held in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking branches.
The main achievement of US imperialism is undoubtedly the income from the massive exploitation of the Filipinos.
In order to get to the Templars, we need to understand the circumstances that led to the Order's creation.
The period of time in which these events took place, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.), is called the High Middle Ages.
The Early Middle Ages preceded the Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, starting with the drive for technology or technological necessity and ending with the strict idea that human destiny is determined by the logic that scientific laws and their implementation in technology are based on.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: one that technology develops on its own in a way that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and the other that technology in turn "influences" immanent rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one might say that the development of roads is inevitably caused by the automobile.
However, the country's road network is not economically viable for small numbers of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
One of the reasons for the increase in road accidents, which may in turn be the basis for new technologies to repair damaged bodies, is the massive increase in car ownership.
An important component of cultural determinism was Romanticism, which came from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic view, geography shaped individuals and over time geography shaped customs and culture that were more in harmony with the location of the socium than arbitrary laws.
Constantinople, like Paris, known as the modern fashion capital of the world, was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
After the return of the Crusaders in the 12th century, when they brought gifts such as silk and spices, its status declined, as these gifts were worth more than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
It was during this period that the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
In the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries, Gothic reached its zenith.
For the first time, Byzantine culture had a major influence on clothing in the East.
However, Western-style species may be 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication sources.
The refinement of individual styles began in Western Europe in the late Middle Ages. One of the major developments of this time, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of the use of hooks to fasten clothes.
Organic farming means producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses stored seeds from plants in the local ecoregion and uses seeding or other relatively simple technologies to increase yields.
Most farmers have historically been farmers for a living, and that's still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who are not bound by social norms and allow them to form a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The qualities that define a subculture as an independent culture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often communicate their membership in a distinctive and symbolic style that includes dress, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways that has been used to illustrate the importance of socialization is through a few unfortunate cases involving children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional violence, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some feral children were isolated from the public (often their own parents); in some cases, the parents abandoned the child because they did not accept that the child had a serious mental or physical disability.
Abandoned children may have suffered abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived independently in the wild.
After being raised by fully feral animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (with limited physical capabilities) that are almost identical to those of its adult animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Scaffolding is a step ahead of project-based learning, which is supposed to make learning easier and more fun.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a supporting tool for individuals who are acquiring new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The matrix can be virtual and it can be real, in other words, the teacher is the form of the matrix, but the matrix is also the little paper man in Microsoft Office.
The purpose of the virtual guesses built into the software is to ask questions, give directions, and explain procedures that might be difficult for a student to do on their own.
Children are placed in shelters for many different reasons, ranging from violence to neglect to bullying.
A child should not grow up in an environment that feels less cared for, less warned, less educated, although it often does.
We believe that the safe zone for these children is the adoption system.
Our obligation to shelters is to provide loving parents, a stable education, safe homes and reliable health care.
Shelters should provide for the needs of children who have been removed from their home.
Both mass and interpersonal communication elements are contained in the Internet.
The distinctive features of the Internet give rise to additional options in terms of the use of the graphics approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socializing' are important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
When they studied audience reactions to web pages, "personal engagement" and "continuous interaction" by Egham and McCord (1998) were also identified as new motivational aspects.
Using video recordings has allowed us to make important breakthroughs in the understanding of microchemicals, facial movements that only last for a few milliseconds.
More specifically, they claim that whether or not a person is lying can be determined by correctly interpreting microimages.
In his book, "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks shows how people who have lost their ability to understand speech due to brain damage can accurately perceive sincerity.
This ability to interpret human behavior, he speculated, might also have been shared by animals, such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century has revealed two forms of hereditary variability: hidden and expressed.
A mutation creates a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination go back and forth between the two forms of hereditary variability for each generation.
In the savannah, primates with human-like digestive systems have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs with the plant resources available.
The failure to do so can also have serious consequences, including severe depression, eating disorders, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resource is the protein that leaves and leafy plants contain, but if they're not prepared, they're hard for primates like us to digest.
However, animal foods - such as ants, termites, and eggs - are not only difficult to digest, but they also contain a high amount of protein, which contains essential amino acids.
It shouldn't surprise us, given all this, that our ancestors solved the "laughing problem" much like the chimpanzees did on the savannah.
Sleep deprivation is the process of intentionally waking up during a period of normal sleep and falling asleep within a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a quiet wake-up to keep you awake instead of waking you up.
If you wear a watch while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to set it.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea) before bedtime, which may cause a person to wake up in a rush.
How calm you are inside is inversely correlated with how tense you are in your mind and body.
As stress decreases, the positive force of life increases in manifestation.
The only thing that's holding us back is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, and was spread by the love of Mahayana and the many methods of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, in its essence, is very simple, and it includes meditation, Kundalini yoga, and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga is practiced by awakening the Kundalini energy (the energy of radiation) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Divine yoga is the center of Tibetan meditation, clearing energy channels, activating chakras, and creating enlightened consciousness through visualization of various deities.
During World War II, the common enemy was Germany, which led the USSR and the United States to cooperate. After the war, differences of opinion over the system, process, and culture led to disagreements between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the Cold War began, and former allies became enemies.
It would continue for the next 40 years from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places on the battlefield.
Polish defences were breached by 17 September 1939, and the only hope was to fall back and reorganize with the Romanian bridgehead fortification.
However, these plans lost momentum overnight when, after the occupation of Poland's eastern regions, more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and opened the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way, especially for transporting large numbers of passengers and goods across the ocean.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to keep a country moving people and goods, while preventing an enemy from moving its own people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II is the most prominent recent example of this, with the Americans attempting to transport troops and supplies across the Atlantic to aid the British.
The German navy, using submarines as its main means of transport, tried to intercept the shipments.
In the event of an Allied collapse, Germany would have been able to invade Britain in much the same way that it had done with the rest of Europe.
The first domestication of goats seems to have occurred about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easier access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in enclosures that grazed on hillsides or other pastures, and were often controlled by children or adults, goat herders, more like the better known ordinary herders. These methods of herding are still used today.
In England, the first food roads were built in the 16th century.
However, the railway track was only made of parallel wooden tracks, and to achieve greater speed and carry more cargo than other rough roads of the day, horses were used to ride on them.
Rail spokes had been invented much earlier to keep the linkages firmly in place, but it was soon realized that the linkages would be more effective if they were struck from above.
This became common practice, but the iron was more likely to cause the wagons to cut through the wooden wheels.
Gradually, iron wheels replaced wooden ones, and in 1767 the first all-metal construction appeared.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means "straight-walking man".
The Australopithecus, their ancestors, could not walk normally.
Adaptation to walking on two legs is found in the Australopithecus fossil, between 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus probably moved on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can join the environmental movement to be more environmentally conscious, and we can even become activists to prevent some kind of future damage.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if our goal is more than just a temporary solution, then we need to find the source of the problem and address it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically as a result of man's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been compounded by overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, the manuscript draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to the John Dunlap Stamp a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and they are now known as the Dunlap plates.
On July 8, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, John Nixon delivered the first public reading of the document.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and the copy arrived in London on August 10.
The oldest extant copy of the document is the 25 Dunlap Tablets. The original manuscript has not survived.
Some paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Because they had a hump and could fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
Birds have many features that make you think of dinosaurs.
They have slender, bulbous legs, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
All computers in use today are based on the virtual processing of binary-coded information.
Only one of the two values can be a binary number, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits in computer jargon - or bits.
Internal toxicity may not be detected immediately, and sensations such as nausea are so common that diagnosis is not possible immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or a toxic chemical in the home.
Check the label for the specific first aid instructions for the particular treatment facility.
For this group of insects, entomologists erroneously use the term "insect".
The term comes from the well-known garden gnome, a species of insect adapted to transmit parasites to humans.
Like the killer parakeet, the bed parakeet is born helpless and adapted to its train's box or habitat.
There are about 400,000 reported cases of MS in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples have the opportunity to plan for adoption.
Adoption terminates the custody of the biological parents so that another couple can have custody of the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the universe works using the scientific method, and in fact, most scientific research is guided by this method.
It's not just an experiment, it's a test that's used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and observing also helps scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on many subjects, including psychology, were accepted.
The West became alienated from the roots of Greek philosophy and science, along with a declining knowledge of Greek.
Many of the rhythms that we often observe in behavior and physiology are critically dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely outwardly periodic instructions, are fixed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-regulating oscillator that follows a period of free cycling even in the absence of external signals.
That DNA is genetic material was one of the key ideas in the Hershey and Chase experiment.
To insert their DNA into bacteria, Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments, either inserting DNA into radioactive phosphorus phages or a phage protein with radioactive starch.
A mutation may have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material being affected, and whether the affected cells are cells of the basal lineage.
Only the germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, otherwise the mutation can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is attracting the attention of people who are interested in visiting natural places to observe landscapes, including plants and wildlife.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting reserves and learning about the ecosystem are examples of activities that can be done here.
Examples of this are visiting Borneo, taking photos, and studying orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns to drive to work, and they're passed by people coming in the opposite direction, whose jobs are in the same places they just left.
In this dynamic transportation morphology, everyone is somehow connected, and it supports a transportation system based on personal cars.
The massive farming of carbon has changed the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years, as science now suggests.
Everyone participates in society, and everyone uses transportation systems, and almost everyone has a claim to transportation systems.
This type of complaint about water quality and collapsing bridges is not common in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints, why do they fail so many times a day? Is it just that transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
The study of the movement of specific drivers and vehicles from two points in distance and their interaction is called traffic flow.
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to study traffic flow, because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100 percent accuracy.
Drivers operate happily within a range of reasonable sequence; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable sequence and can be represented mathematically roughly.
The relationship was established between three main characteristics to better understand the traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) intensity, and (3) speed.
These interconnections help plan, design, and operate highway maintenance.
The first animals to fly were insects, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily, find food, and organize themselves more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of smaller-sized places to hide from predators.
Today, only the insects called the hemipterids and the unicorns can't fold their wings back.
A man named Aristarchus thousands of years ago said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
While some thought that he was right, many believed that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because you don't feel the Earth moving at all, do you?
The Amazon River is the second-longest river on earth, and it is eight times as dense as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
The Amazon provides a full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
The pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical perfection, but the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in official communication and legislation.
Italian is also the everyday language used by those employed in governmental structures, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, because with primitive tools, they could easily extract and extract all of these in their natural form in nature.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Although it resembled the four more aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, he also speculated that they were being transformed into new substances to form what we perceive.
A alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, the periodic table of the elements combines many elements.
Metals include elements like calcium and potassium, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You might also have some compounds that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, and a trillion atoms could fall into the end of this sentence.
So the dagger has been a good and trusted friend to many people since its arrival in the world.
Sadly, however, with the advent of new writing methods, the writing of the alphabet lost much of its prestige and importance.
And since people are now typing messages on computer screens, they don't even have to look at the mirror.
You might wonder why you change the keyboard every time something new comes out.
The way the atomic bomb works is by the energy it takes to make a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like you're standing on a very heavy uranium mountain, and the nucleus is still splitting, and then it's releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they can be broken apart with little or no contact.
The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust, and the surface is covered with rocks and dust.
The near side of the crust is about 45 miles [70 km] deep, and the far side is about 60 miles [100 km] deep.
It's thinner at sea, and thicker in the mountains.
And because the crust is thinner on this side, there may be more lunar striations on the side that's closer, and the lava could have been more easily eroded.
What drives people and what attracts them, I study theories of content.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are satisfied as they enter adulthood.
These theories explore what it is about some people that makes them want things, what factors in their environment make them do or not do things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are the two most common content theories.
When managers start to get tired of their former peers, there are generally two types of behavior that can occur. One of these behaviors involves being the "one guy"
Making unpopular decisions, disciplining, evaluating performance, distributing responsibility and accountability to people are not characteristics of this type of manager.
The stranger becomes a figure at the other end of the spectrum who feels that they have to change everything and make it their business, which is what the team has been doing.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Most of the time, this kind of behavior creates a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed according to the same advanced standards as a real team, with some minor differences.
Virtual team members are often the contact persons of the physical team.
They often have more autonomy than the average team member, as their team may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is the existence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109).
A team of three is a management team to which all members are accountable. The team of three sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the laborious process of creating an organizational learning environment? Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional units of the organization, creativity and inventiveness emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome barriers can result in a new innovative process to meet customer demands.
Leadership, before an organization becomes innovative, must establish a culture of both innovation and knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains a method for organizations to achieve higher levels of efficiency using the  continuum approach.
The physical evidence for the theoretical approach to consciousness is the neurobiological data, so it narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is helping scientists to do research.
It has long been known that certain brain injuries, trauma, pathological changes and cancers affect human behavior and also cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
It provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build a simulation model that helps us understand the processes that go on in our minds.
Although closely associated with science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science concerned with the adaptation of behavior, learning, and intelligence in machines.
The study of artificial intelligence involves the development of mechanisms to automate tasks that require intelligence skills.
Control, scheduling and scheduling, responding to customer diagnostics and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition are examples of this.
It has become a separate discipline that focuses on how to solve real-life problems.
Today, AI systems are widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are integrated into home computers and some video game software.
Excursions are an important part of any learning process, and often a teacher wants to take his students to places where they cannot get to by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, where students can spend time with their classmates, exploring museum exhibits, visiting an aquarium, or enjoying fine art.
A virtual tour is a great way for prospective students to reflect on their journey and share their experiences.
For example, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is updated annually, but older versions are kept online as a memoir.
Student writing can also be facilitated by blogs, whereas students begin their blogging experience with raw grammar and spelling, having an audience changes all that.
Since the most critical audience is the students, the blogger tries to refine her writing style to reduce criticism.
Blogging also forces students to "take in the world around them". The need to satisfy the interests of the audience drives students to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool to inspire students to work together and to motivate them to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
By using blogs in the right way, students can be motivated to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their own positions and perspectives on specific issues in the context of other students' work (Oravisi, 2002).
In Canada's charming bilingual capital, Ottawa, you can visit renowned galleries and a variety of museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and further north is Muskoka and the unspoiled beauty of nature beyond.
All of these and more underscore the perception of Ontario as essentially Canadian by foreigners.
The northern areas are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited deserts.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are located off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Of these, Madagascar is the largest, and it may be said to be a continent in itself because of the variety of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands, known as rich coastal resorts, are either independent or associated with France.
The Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
When the Portuguese explorers Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope, European influence and colonization began in the 15th century.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler, regardless of actual marital status, state that she is married.
It is best to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can be perceived as gender oppression and that it is common for someone to approach a woman, put their hand on her arm and throw up.
Say no firmly to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences are not a reason to judge!).
In the 10th century BC, the modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen, it was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinese.
The Portuguese razed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, and it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Darou-l-Badia and it was named by the Spanish merchants who founded the Casablanca trade routes.
Casablanca is the least attractive place to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold and where you can buy tajine, crockery, leather goods, chili and a whole range of soups, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed the city of Goma, leaving most of the streets, especially the city center, covered in lava.
Any travel outside Goma, even though it is reasonably safe to travel in Goma, should be explored in advance to study the fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also used as a base for hiking on the Nyiragongo volcano and is one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). Usually (locally), a short-distance ride costs about 500 Congolese francs.
Due to its inaccessibility, Timbuctoo is used as a metaphor for exotic distant lands.
Despite its tourist attractions, reputation, and airport, Timbuktu is still a poor city.
It was added to the World Heritage List in 1990, as it was threatened by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops in the public broadcasting of Henry Louis Gates' book The Wonders of the African World.
The city is markedly different from the rest of the country because it has more of an Arab than African niche.
Kruger National Park (Kep) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Zimbabwe to the north, Mozambique to the east, and the Yangtze River border to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which contains a variety of wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is considered the best example of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, it has a daily nature reserve and an entrance fee.
Buying a Wild Card, which gives you access to a part of a South African park or to the entire South African National Park, can also be lucrative.
The district of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, a place of great interest to many tourists.
The water of the buildings that form the Hong Kong contour resembles the polished column diagram that is prominently displayed on the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head for the Kowloon coastline on the opposite side.
Along the northern coast, in the arid land, much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is overcrowded.
This is the area that the British colonists took over and made their own territory, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans, the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretches for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast of Bangladesh and the Indian mountain range.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Indian part of the forest is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, but also the surviving remnants of the once mighty jungle that once stretched across the Ganges.
Sundarbans is 3,850 km2 (1,850 sq mi) in area, of which about one-third is covered by water.
Sundarbans has been a sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 herons in the area.
From the intercity bus station (River Pass), buses, especially those that depart between 06:30 and 07:30, travel east and towards Jakarta/Bumnungsari, running throughout the day.
Since inter-city buses are often crowded, it is recommended that you buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Comfortable and durable small Japanese buses serve most of the neighborhoods.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get around nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punaha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge over the Oiapoque River, connecting Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in the south of France.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters and is followed by two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical gauge is 15 metres (49 ft) below the bridge. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to road traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be put into operation in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian Customs posts will be completed.
The most important indigenous group was the Guaraní, who live in eastern Paraguay now, and are semi-nomadic hunters while also engaged in family farming.
The Chaco region was home to aboriginal tribes like the Guaycuru and the Paigua, who made their living by hunting, fishing and gathering.
In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors and local aboriginal groups combined to form what was formerly known as the Giant Province of India.
The Spanish began a colonization that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to preserve many of its original characteristics and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is known worldwide for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, it is also possible to watch less important tournaments and matches.
For tournament news and information on where to buy tickets to polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falklands, with a rate of exchange equal to one British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the island, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store, is where you can transfer money.
In general, British pounds are accepted anywhere in the islands, and in many cases, Stanley credit cards and US dollars are accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted in remote islands, but they do accept British and U.S. currency; consult the owners in advance to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
Try to exchange the currency before leaving the islands, as it is almost impossible to exchange the official Falkland currency outside the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and summer in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; temperatures of +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: Although temperatures rarely fall below freezing, the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no defined "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animal is still wild and does not need to be fed or cared for.
The park's management recommends a minimum of 100 yards [100 m] with bears and wolves, and 25 yards [25 m] with other wildlife.
Almost all large animals, including bison, wasps, horses, and bears, no matter how docile they may appear, can attack.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year, and that's because they don't keep their distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so you have to have some space with them.
Also, bear in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted to odors, so avoid carrying or preparing smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu. It has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a naval confrontation that came to trial in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except the British cruiser were sunk, with about 200 Americans and Germans dead.
A peaceful rally in the city ended with the death of the first ruler, Tupua Tamase Lealof III, in a struggle for independence organized by the Mous movement.
Because of the many ports that connect Auckland, there are many beaches, with three of the most popular being the three areas.
The Pacific Ocean is home to the Northern Beaches (North Harbor Region), which stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost everywhere is a sandy beach, where you can swim safely and take shade from the Pohutucaua trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in the Waitemata Harbour, a prestigious suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
There are occasional family beaches with a wide selection of shops lining the beach.
Number One is a local spirit beer that is not complex but has a pleasant and refreshing aroma. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are a lot of French wines, but it's better to ship New Zealand and Australian wines.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are careful, bottled water can easily be spilled.
The idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. They call a little black coffee an espresso, a cappuccino has a high layer of cream (not coffee), and tea is served without milk.
The Belgian standard is perfectly matched by hot chocolate, and the fruit juices, though expensive, have a delicious flavor.
Many travelers visit the reef throughout the year, although damage from any of these causes is rare.
Follow the instructions of the authorities, observe all signs and safety warnings, and pay close attention to them, no matter what.
From October to April 1770, cubomeduos appeared near the coast and in river estuaries. They were found again and again after this period.
Deer do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most humans are afraid of and shy away from humans.
The saltwater crocodiles' main habitat is the rivers north of Rockhampton, but they are passive in the ocean.
Advance booking gives travelers peace of mind because they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often arrange deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as holiday accommodation, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast and transportation to/from the airport or a combination of flight and hotel.
In case you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents (e.g. visa) for your destination, they will save you money.
First of all, any type of change or request should be communicated to the travel agency and not directly through the hotel.
Especially at music festivals, the absolute majority of the audience at some festivals camp on the spot, which is an essential part of the experience for most.
If you want to be close to the activity you're planning to take you have to get there early to be able to set up the tents in the camp close to the music.
Remember that if the music on the main stage has finished, there may be sections of the festival where the music is played late.
Some festivals have a special camping area for families with young children.
If you're visiting the northern Baltic in winter, since snowmobiling is so noisy for those most affected, check the location of the snowplow.
Saint Petersburg cruises include a tour of the city. Visa requirements (see conditions) do not apply to cruise passengers.
Usually, casinos do whatever they can to increase the amount of time and money spent by visitors. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and it is also difficult to find an exit.
To keep guests in good spirits and out of the building, they usually provide special food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and a good player knows the importance of staying alert.
If you are planning to drive on a high slope or over a cliff, you should be aware of the possibility of snow, frost, or subzero temperatures.
The carpet is less powerful on icy and snowy roads, and you can't drive on the same way on bare asphalt.
In a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to keep you in one place.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or sleet, condensation on car windows, or ice cover.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries and do not disrupt traffic all year round.
In Africa, the safari is perhaps the most popular sight and attraction for many visitors.
The term safari in popular contexts refers to overland travel in the wilds of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals tend to get close to machines, like elephants and giraffes, and with standard equipment, they're easy to see.
Sometimes lions, tigers, monkeys, and leopards are very shy, and you can only see them with binoculars.
A footpath (also called a "belly walk", "footpath", or "walk") is a path that can take several hours or days to complete.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with several events taking place in different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the first Games in 1964.
If you book your flights and accommodations for 2020 before they're rescheduled, you might be in trouble.
The restrictions vary from case to case, but the latest news in March was that most of the coronavirus restrictions would not be lifted until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets to attend the event will be priced between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets priced between 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a bathroom and a dining table for temporary assistance when he is not in the room.
If you have a wart or don't like to wear unwanted underwear, you may want to try using a hair dryer if you can.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, to chafe).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you don't like something, then buy bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unknown in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections to others.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can use force to harm or kill humans are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free trade is the ability to purchase goods in specific locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duty.
Travelers who plan to visit countries with high tax obligations, sometimes especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, can save a considerable amount of money.
The section between Foyn Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated cavernous forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, take control of your mind: The steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are quite different.
The posted speed limits are lower than on the previous and following sections  generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict observance is even more mandatory.
It's strange, but unlike other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Canal, the cell phone connection is much better here.
German confectionery is quite good, and in Bavaria, as in their southern neighbor Austria, it is quite varied and different.
Fruit pies are very popular. Apple buns are baked all year round, and the inside of the apple and the cloves are added in the summer.
Most German breads contain nuts, onions, and other nuts, and their popular cakes are made with a particularly strong coffee.
If you want to taste a more delicious confection, try a Berliner, a Pankochen, or a Krapf, as they are called in the region.
Curry is a dish of vegetables and spices, often served with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be either "dry" or "thin".
Machi is often used in curry dishes in the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, while coconut milk is often used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term for the food that is prepared on 17,000 islands and that combines the diverse regional cuisines from all over the country.
But without further specification, the term refers to foods originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is common throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of dishes rich in scents, with the predominant flavor for Javanese being ground chilies, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The rider's legs are supported by a saddle on either side of the rider.
They offer more reliability to the rider, but there is a safety risk that the rider may trip his foot on them.
