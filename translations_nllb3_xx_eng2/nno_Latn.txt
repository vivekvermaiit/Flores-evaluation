This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that this animal's feathered coat was chestnut brown on the upper part with a bleached or carotenoid-colored underparts.
The findings also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathered dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other features of feathers  barbs and barbules , the researchers assumed that the rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure of the feathers indicated that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display, and the researchers noted that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimens show the adult feathered and not the tail of a young bird.
The researchers noted that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show the adult feathered and not the down of a bird.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and enclose a pre-printed paper ballot indicating their choice of candidate in a convoluted envelope.
After the official verifies the voter's identity, the voter places the convoluted ballot in the voting box and signs the voting form.
French civil law codifies the treatment relatively strictly.
Since 1988, voting boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of the voting process and that no envelopes are added except those of accurately selected and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to follow each part of the process, and in the evening, votes are tallied by volunteers under close observation and following specific procedures.

Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five persons who assaulted the Swiss woman and have found her portable computer and mobile phone".
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver of the car suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the raucous Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of his son in Edinburgh's lensmannsrett.
She is being held in custody awaiting trial, but eyewitness evidence is suspected to be manipulated as her photographs have been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system operates differently and the court has deemed the publication of the images to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "Journalists seem to be taking a dangerous direction in publishing photos and similar material of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has the sole responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made in any case until the prosecution is brought to justice.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, which Pakistan wants based on the pre-1967 borders.
Other topics covered, according to reports, include the future of the state of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the conflict over the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian authorities are the only ones in such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were to be monitored thoroughly by weighers while the effect of the trial was assessed and monitored.
In a partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sports Shooter Organization of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited to the Sports Shooter Organization's hunting program.
According to the current director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service's Park Protection and Heritage, the first four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional election in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former provisional election council's departure as part of a package of measures to guide the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to a widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
The occasional violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some dating back to 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods being overheated have been reported, leading to a total of six fires and four people suffering minor injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, the Ministry of Trade and Industry announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more cases of "very serious" overheating.
The Department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "particularly regrettable".
The quake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Agency, there were no reports of damage to the Commonwealth.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza used an M16 rifle to shoot the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, the children and the eldest, were released at an early stage, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it could induce the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that government investigators had found the two "black boxes" containing the plane's audio recordings.
Other athletes also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin Goldsmith Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as I am...maybe even more so...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those who took part in the poll shared this view and wish that Queen Elizabeth would be Australia's last monarch.
At most, 29 percent of those questioned thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have been questioned.
He has not been able to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as they are illegal in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Thursday.
Comets may have been a source of water supplies to Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets take shape, especially how the Earth took shape since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this month and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumors as "political talk and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the U.S. Air Transportation Safety Board claims allows aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional services have been provided and no trains will stop at Wembley, in addition to parking and transportation not being available at the venue.
Fears of a lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the fight will go on behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new bird species evolved after only two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, as a result of the endemic Darwin's finch, the mid-earth spur, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostis.
Gold can be worked into any shape, or rolled into very small shapes.
It can be spun into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, or it can be hammered and rolled out to form sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, and sometimes it can be used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using the juice of red cabbage.
The candle changes color depending on the acidity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogenions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogenions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo had a spyle toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of the sewerage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were present together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite that's in space, receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost circumnavigating.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists using space telescopes believe that the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and sight.
It takes a large rocket that is over 100 feet too high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster means of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other transportation units.
Among them are medium-sized cats as a medium-sized prey, ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat a much more varied selection of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special job each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called packs.
Flocks are made up of one to three adult male lions, along with as many as thirty female lions and their young.
The Lovinids are usually related to each other, and are a large family with sisters and daughters.
Løveflokkar (wolf packs) are very similar to wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a highly flexible sportsman, the tiger can climb (albeit not so well), swim, run long distances and draw with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is a member of the genus Panthera, along with lions, leopards, and jaguars, and is the only cat that roars.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as that of a lion, but more like a sentence of growling, roaring words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals, and they like to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can.
Researchers believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (bytte) by smell, sniffing their way to wherever they have been on the ground.
They have excellent night vision, and are very agile in their movements, hunting by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings while lurking for their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (such as if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that it is difficult for them to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one from which they originated.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors which means that the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a strong competitor than those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they need to continue the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population has begun to adapt to their new environment, which causes them to become more and more different from the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process species formation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (in other words, outgassing).
Plants make their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was a top consumer in its day, so it feared nothing  except other mosasaurs.
The long-jawed males were surrounded by more than seventy sharp teeth, and with an extra set in the jaw. In other words, there was no way out for those who crossed the road.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, it may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that landed in the water  even giant dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus rex, were no object to him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did add some unusual dishes to their feasts, including wild boar, peafowl, snails and a type of rodent called the sea-eaters.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their meals sitting, the rich men liked to have banquets together while lying on their sides when they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods brought to Europe or America from Asia in later centuries.
They had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, for example, and no Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered their home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and an inner sanctuary to which only priests had access.
Occasionally, distinctive pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple complex.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked on the courtyard; the shops were open disks facing the street, and the stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled, and the Norse sagas relate that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he travelled further west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Although he made this discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at this time.
Although each of the countries was skandinaviske there were major differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The National Treasure you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
This is however not true, even though there is something written on the back, there is no tax map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words original declaration of independence dated July 4, 1776, which appear on the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one can say for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up early in its life for storage.
So it's likely that the notation was simply added as a notation.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part remained unfreed.
It was ruled by the French Vichy regime, which had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and independent French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is basically a culture shared by a group of people of a significant size who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, and in some ways also defines the size of society.
A civilization is the continuous transmission of knowledge across generations, a lingering cultural imprint and a fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government with the Congress as its only component during the secession from the Confederacy.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and as it had no executive or judicial function, it relied on state authorities, who were then often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The enactments required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, are the two most successful football teams in the world, and were FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in the international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
As a consequence of its clusters of islands, Japan is often referred to, from a geological perspective, as an  archipelago.
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European seafarers passing by recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the native peoples' grain-producing practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coast, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the country until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and the rebuilding process continues today.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, a little confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest full-length ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats for example) are similar to, or approximately the same as, this page ratio.
It greatly criticized and often derided the rule that thirds are a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order.
It states that the most effective placement for headers is at the intersection of the lines, which divide images into vertical and horizontal segments (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had bound European states together, despite differences in language and customs.
It had an all-encompassing power that affected everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money of the church is there for precisely this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade broke generally accepted international laws, codified by several small international agreements over the past two decades.
The UK laid mines in international waters to prevent all ships from sailing into the entire sea area and inflicted damage on neutral ships themselves.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
Through the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most of the residents were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the hardships and heartbreak of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and an attest from Charles Batchelor (his former manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time; each stage of China and each family in power became a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces, the best known of these periods being the Three Kingdoms epoch which occurred in 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was frequent warfare between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were also opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the military, whose rankings were now based on completeness rather than class, as they had been before.
The French Revolution inspired many other people, from the oppressed working classes of other countries, to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters outside of his everyday life, often using a mine known as Hira on the mountain Noor (light) for his grubling.
The cave itself, which survived through the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual decline.
The cave sits on top of the mountains north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists, because once you're inside the mine, you're completely isolated.
All that is visible is a clear, beautiful cloud overhead, and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the mine.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, and is one of many pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-arch mark looks like a V and the down-arch mark like a stift or square missing from the bottom.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-blow usually produces a softer sound, while a down-blow is stronger and more definite.
Make your own markings, but remember that the markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The surviving King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a member of the mob beheaded a royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the American imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of their expenses, and the interest on their bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking system.
The super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would, of course, constitute the fundamental achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that facilitated the formation of the order.
The period of these events is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a broad range of ideas, from technological progress or the technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the very development of technology goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on the society at large, rather than social conditioning.
One could say, for example, that the motor car will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network is not economically viable to serve only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Public car ownership also increases the incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the discovery of new techniques for treating injured people by the healthcare system.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geography was shaped by the individual, and over time the customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 and lasted until about 1100.
This status was diminished during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital, from Constantinople to Paris, was transferred.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
Due to slow communication channels, western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was as a result of the Crusaders, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture for subsistence is agriculture practiced for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Life-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses stored seeds from the eco-region combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for subsistence and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals, who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through their distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some of these children have been abandoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children as a result of their parents' rejection of a child's serious, intellectual or physical disabilities.
They may have experienced child abuse or trauma, before being abandoned or run away.
Others have been claimed to have been raised by animals; some have been thought to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by non-human animals, children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of their caregivers, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Whereas project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, constructivist design takes learning a step further.
Constructive design is not a learning method, but rather a tool that supports individuals in pursuing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A tutor can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of tutor, but so is the little binders-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stillas are internalised in the software and are meant to set the question mark by guiding, and clarifying procedures that might have been too demanding for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We're looking at the Child Welfare Act as a safety net for these kids.
Our Child Protection Act is meant to provide safe homes, loving caregivers and stable education, as well as reliable health care.
Foster homes were meant to cover all the needs of the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet led to multiple dimensions in its approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for networking (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuing relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
It is especially claimed that a person's lying can be detected by interpreting the micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech as a result of brain damage, are nevertheless able to assess frequency correctly.
He even suggests that such a capacity to interpret human behavior may be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two sources of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the realm of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move the variation back and forth between the two fortresses with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its need for amino acids from available plant resources.
And failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most available panter resources would have been the proteins available in leaves and berries, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, not only are animal foods (mice, termites, eggs) digestible, but they make a high amount of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
Given all this, it shouldn't be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a silent alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you reset the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known water-driving liquids) before sleep, which will force one to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person feels when he is in a room is the opposite of the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force.
Anyone can access it. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the Maha-Dha-Dha Way of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
The Tibetan Buddhist tradition is very simple in principle, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of the Kundalini energy through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the god-yoga, where the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is created through the visualization of various gods.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and at the end of the war, the conflicting systems, processes, and cultures of the two countries did not go hand in hand.
Two years after the end of the war, the two allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and was fought in real life, by proxy forces, on battlefields from America to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along Romanian bridgeheads.
However, these plans were delayed overnight, as over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is clearly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the seas.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, impeding your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent examples that is worth noting of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly by means of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The animal husbandry was initiated in ancient cultures to provide easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were normally kept in flocks grazing on fields in the hills or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or young - a form of herding goat, and these methods of herding are still used today.
Wooden railway decks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these tracks were made up of parallel wooden planks, they enabled the horses that pulled the carts to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
Sviller was introduced relatively early to hold the skins in place, but it was soon realized that the skins became more effective if they were to be pierced with a little iron.
This became common, but the iron caused greater wear on the three-wheeled carriages.
Eventually, the three-wheeled vehicle was replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first rails made exclusively of iron were introduced.
The first known form of transportation is walking, which is the first known human walking activity.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, were not regularly uplifted.
Two-legged specialisations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the future burden to some degree.
This is in many cases the same as treating symptoms but if we don't want just an interim solution, we need to find the root of the problems and in that way solve them.
It's obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humans and problems have been made bigger by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of humans.
After the convention adopted the declaration on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by the president of the convention, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, sent some quarters farther away to John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in front of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read the document to the troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, a copy reached London.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document, although the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But the birds have a lot in common with the dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs just like a T-Rex.
So basically all the computers that are in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits  or bits, for the sake of common data jargon.
The symptoms of internal poisoning are not always easy to detect, and may be so diffuse that it is not possible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning is an open pillbox or toxic household chemicals in front of you.
Read the label to find out what kind of first aid you should give for the drug in question.
In formal usage, entomologists use the term insekt for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient knowledge of the wall geese, which are insects that are very well adapted to be parasites on humans.
Both predators and wall animals are nidicolae, adapted to live in nests or in the house of the host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, and that includes the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerves.
According to research, women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple might decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of the child.
These couples can choose to adopt the baby.
By adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works, through the scientific method, which serves as the guideline for most scientific research.
But not only that, experimentation is also used an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible, in Latin.
Aristotle's view of all things scientific was accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West was torn away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and the production of these through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, are documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-contained oscillating generators that will continue periods of free cycling, even when there are no external signals present.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading theories that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they either marked the DNA in the phosphorus or the protein in the sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are kimbane cells.
Only mutations in kimbane cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to see the beautiful landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people take their cars and leave small suburbs to go to work, while others pass them on their way to work at the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
The research now suggests that this massive CO2 economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about the quality of water or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, and why do they fail every day? are transportation engineers simply incompetent? or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and their vehicles between two points and the interchange between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because one cannot predict driving behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range, and traffic flows are thus often reasonably stable and can be represented roughly mathematically.
A relationship has been established between the three main characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are useful when planning, designing and using road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to do so made it easier for them to avoid enemies and to find food and mates.
The advantage of most insects is that they can extend their wings backward along their body.
This gives them a choice of several small hiding places to hide from predators.
The only insects that do not have the ability to break in are the eye-biters and the day-flyers.
Many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some believed it, but many believed the opposite, that it was the solar system that moved around the earth, including the sun (and all other stars).
It's not so strange, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It has more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, at some points being 9.5 km wide.
A full 20 percent of all the water that flows out of all the rivers of the world into the ocean comes from the Amazon basin.
The main channel of the Amazon River is 6387 km long, draining thousands of small rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever succeeded in surpassing the Giza pyramids in size and technical prowess.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City State has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of the day for most of the state's workers, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All of the inhabitants of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
The basic chemical elements of gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, as they are all naturally occurring and relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that all things were made of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also created a theory that they change into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals, and they are the elements that are found in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals and of course there are also the metals silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that are made up of small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so extremely small that there's room for many trillions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend to many when it was invented.
Unfortunately, it has been downgraded to a lower status and is less used as newer writing methods are introduced.
People now type messages on computer screens and never need a pencil tip.
After all, we can only wonder what's going to happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, and then when you split the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they are separated from each other by little or no influence.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The corpuscles are about 70 km thick at the nearest side and 100 km thick at the farthest side.
It is thinner under the dark areas and thicker under the light areas.
There may be more mares on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around figuring out what motivates people, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as we grow up.
The theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want, and what it is about their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of behavior that can occur when leaders start hiring people who were previously on their level. At one end of the spectrum, you have the leader who is trying to stay "one of the pack".
This type of leader has trouble making unpopular decisions, correcting employees, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
And at the other end of the spectrum, you have the leader who becomes a stranger, and who feels that he or she has to change everything that the group has been involved with, and make it their own.
It is, after all, the leader who is responsible for both the ups and downs of the group.
This behavior often results in conflict between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups hold the same superior standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often serve as the point of contact for the nearest physical group.
They often govern themselves more independently than conventional group members because their groups often meet at varying times, which may not be met with understanding by the local leadership.
The fact that the group is truly usyn (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109), is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The invisible group is the leadership group to which each member reports, and sets the standards for each individual member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process as establishing a learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can flourish.
One result of this process of an organization working together to address an obstacle is that it leads to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must establish a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
The neuroscience data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and the research area is thereby narrowed and much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to look and examine brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that can help us understand the processes in the brain.
Although science fiction makes strong associations with artificial intelligence (AI), AI is a very important part of computer science in terms of the way machines are managed, learning and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from customers as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The KI system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military and is incorporated into many PC apps and video game apps.
Excursions are a big part of any teaching, and it's quite common for a teacher to take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's largest city, and every year they rebuild the website, but keep old versions on the web as a sort of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills, and although students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they gain an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve her writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also encourages students to understand the world around them better, and the need to satisfy the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn something outside of the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical, by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of other people's texts as well as sketch their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part houses the unused and naturally beautiful Muskoka.
All of this and more highlights Ontario as the most typically Canadian place for foreigners.
Large areas further north have fairly scattered settlements, and some areas are near-open wilderness.
Here's a comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are people in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the world's largest and most diverse continent in terms of plant and animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are connected to France, and are known as luxury resorts with beautiful beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it had a great influence on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of actual civil status.
It also helps to wear a ring (don't touch one that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, taken in the arm, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, it doesn't matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 9th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Meranids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, there are traditional Moroccan stalls selling tagine, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of fjas, but all are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located far to the east of the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the city streets, especially in the center, were covered by lava.
It's relatively safe in Goma, but if you're going to travel outside of Goma, you have to do a lot of research to find out what the situation is in the province of North Kivu in light of the ongoing conflict there.
It is also the base camp for those who want to climb to the top of the Nyiragongo volcano, and the starting point for those who want to take one of the most affordable hikes in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
The most common (local) fare for a short trip is ~500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative difficulty of access, Timbuktu is often used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city of poverty, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the big stops in Henry Louis Gates's program, Wonders of the African World, which ran on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country, being more Arabic than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each with different animal and plant life.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park has a nature management fee and an entrance fee.
You can also purchase a Wild Card, which gives you free entry to either selected national parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the destination for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering pedestal that is revealed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best view of Hong Kong is if you leave the island and take the Kowloon Beach Line on the other side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on volcanoes along the northern coastline.
This was the place that the British colonizers took as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest marshy area in the world, extending 80 km inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is located in the Indian territory of the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, but some of the last remaining stocks of the enormous jungles that once covered the Ganges.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, approximately one third of which is covered by water/myr area.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife and plant sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30 000 Akshashorts in the area.
Buses run from the bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those with eastbound and Jakar/Bumthang routes, run between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since these buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most of the districts have small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and solid.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two arches that are 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 metres, and construction was completed in August 2011 and the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian toll controls are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important group of people inhabiting what is now called Eastern Paraguay, where they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also subsisted on agriculture.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous groups such as the guaycurú and the payaguá survived by hunting, trapping and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native tribes.
The Spanish began a three-hundred-year colonization period.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has managed to preserve much of the distinctiveness and identity of its indigenous people.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held on the December polobane in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, tournaments and matches are held on a smaller scale.
Contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo to find out more about tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) with a fixed exchange rate to the British Pound (GBP).
You can change money in the only bank on the islands, in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland pound outside the islands, so you should do this before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and in the summer months temperatures are typically above +30 °C.
Winters can be miserably cold, with temperatures rarely below freezing, but the combination of wind and high humidity makes it appear colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special rainy or dry seasons, but there is about the same amount of rainfall throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is nonetheless wild, and the animals should not be fed or disturbed.
The park service asks you to stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how compassionate they may seem, bison, deer, elk, bear and most other large animals can attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them the space they need.
In addition, you should be aware that odors attract bears and other animals, so you should avoid bringing or cooking food that smells, and the clay must be kept clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889 a special situation arose at the port, as seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave.
All ships sank except one British warship, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of its leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland stretches between two harbours, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Harbour district's northern coastline is on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe conditions for swimming, and most of them also have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coastline.
The local beer is called Number One and is not a complex beer, but is good and refreshing.
There are many French wines to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines would probably be a better choice.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to get if you want to be on the safe side.
A flat white would be a long way from an Australian, a small black coffee is espresso, a cappuccino is served with a lot of cream puffs (no milk froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of a Belgian standard, and the fruit juices are expensive but good.
Many tours are held throughout the year, and damage to the reef is rare.
However, it is wise to follow the advice of the authorities and to follow all signs and warnings.
Cubic metres are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the small town of 1770 and occasionally at other times of the year.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, but their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers can be assured that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, for example on a camping site, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package tours that include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and occasionally combined airline and hotel packages.
It is also possible to keep the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or arrange other documents for the destination (e.g. visas).
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants choose to camp at the festival, and most participants consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be up close to what's happening, you have to get there early to get a tent near the music.
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stage has ended, there may be other places on the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have their own camping areas for families with small children.
If you're going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, because some people hear it especially well when the ship is passing through the ice.
A cruise to St. Petersburg will give you some time in the city, and cruise passengers do not require a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos make sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible there, and windows and clocks are usually missing, and it can be difficult to find your way out.
Special prices are often offered for food, drinks and entertainment to keep the mood up.
Some places offer free drinks with alcohol, but intoxication is known to impair judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone who is going to drive on higher latitudes or over mountain passes must be aware that snow, ice or cold can be encountered.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that you could get stuck.
Visibility may also be impaired by falling or blown snow on the route, or by the formation of ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to trips on land to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to walk near the cars, and standard equipment will provide good views.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes a little shy, and you'll see them better with a mirror.
A bush walk (also called a bush walk, bush hiking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walking safari, bush walk safari, bush walk safari, bush walk safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush safari, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush, bush
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the Games were postponed, it might get difficult.
The rules for cancellation vary, but from the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related cancellation rules will not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2500 JPY and 130 000 JPY, with the most common tickets costing around 7000 JPY.
Wet clothes can be made drier if you iron them. Many hotels have ironing boards and ironing irons for loan, although you won't always find these in the room.
If you can't borrow an iron, or if you don't want to wear straightened socks, you might want to try using a hair dryer.
Be careful not to overheat the material (which can cause it to shrink or, in the worst case, cause it to swell).
There are many different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water lasts for a minute, while in others it must be boiled for several minutes.
Filter efficiency varies, and if you don't feel completely confident, you might consider buying bottled water with a seal from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit infections.

The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont begins on the extremely challenging Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often driving through open woodlands.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you must keep your head cool when encountering steep inclines, narrow lanes and sharp turns, which are typical of this stretch.
The speed limits are significantly lower than earlier and later road sections, usually 5664 km/h (3540 mph), and it is even more important than otherwise to follow these.
Interestingly, the mobile coverage is much better here than on many other stretches of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakeries are quite good, and in Bayern they are quite powerful and varied, as in their southern neighbour, Austria.
Baked goods with fruit are common, with apples added year round, while cherries and plums are used in summer.

The stigbølar supports the rider's feet, which hang down on each side of the hall.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but this can be a safety hazard, as the feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse, but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged after the horse has jumped off the horse.
First, most riders use riding boots with a heeled sole and a smooth and quite narrow sole.
Some sails, especially English sails, also have a safety mechanism that allows a saddle to be released from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a rider who is about to fall off.

Outdoor sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which a person skims down snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to their feet.
Skiing is a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as skibomsar, who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing/ski driving is very old, with cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
Slalom as a sport dates back to the 1600s, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Australians.
Skiing: This is also called wilderness skiing, cross-country skiing, or mountain skiing.
The activity is related to, but does not normally involve, randonee skis on high mountains or top tours in steep terrain, which require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the trail you're going to walk as a long hike.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than if you walk, but only very rarely do you go as fast as on cross-country in prepared runners without a heavy bag on your back.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states, and usually when traveling through several countries, one must go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
But the Schengen area functions almost like one country in this context.
As long as you're in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through multiple passport checks.
If you have a Schengen visa, it works the same way, you don't have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antiques, although some tax authorities define antiques as being goods older than 100 years.

Household products are classified as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindrift is an important way of life for the Sami, and the culture of the industry is also important to many other professions.
Traditionally, not all Saami have been involved in reindeer herding on a large scale, but live off fishing, hunting and the like, and have mostly used reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Samis work in modern industries, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, i.e. Sameland.

Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A web search for "Hostile environment course" or "conflict management course" will likely find the address of a local company.
One course normally covers the situations discussed here in more detail, usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts 25 days and involves role-playing, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines on how to survive in the wilderness, but few publications on war sons.

Outgoing streams are streams of water from waves that have broken against the shore, and which withdraw, often at reefs and the like.
Due to its subsea topology, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper corridors, where a rapid current can form outward toward deeper water.
Most of them die of exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it's no more difficult to swim back than it normally would be.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught in the current again. alternatively, depending on what you can handle, and if someone has caught sight of you, you might want to wait for someone to rescue you.
Conversely, a culture shock may come faster than a culture shock (fertile wheat bread days), and this may last longer and be more powerful.
Those who have been traveling and have had an easy time adapting to a new culture may have found it extra difficult to adapt to their own culture again.
When they come home after living abroad, they have adapted to the new culture and lost some of their old habits.
When they went abroad, people were probably patient and accommodating at the start, since it takes some time for newcomers to adjust to a new country.
Not everyone is as patient and welcoming when travelers return home, but this is so important.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most exciting in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the still before the show starts.

The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas, located 120 km north of the peninsula.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the overflowing caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular and natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on this side of the peninsula melt together in the plateau, but reappear later to form a 360 km long chain of mountains in the form of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.

Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat to every seventh or eighth person.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. the number in the Netherlands is from one to forty).
Most cruises in the Baltics have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
So that means you can visit the historic city for two full days, but you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore when you are part of excursions arranged on the tour, you do not need a visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin in Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not in the vicinity of the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be scary for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced something traumatic.

The cost of delivering goods quickly is high for the company, and time is of great importance when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, the major airlines have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies this was a problem.
If they were to send things by air, it could have taken several days of loading and tolling on some routes.
The only thing that worked to get them through faster was to send the check-in baggage -- the airline regulations didn't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
It's just a matter of paying for a bunch of seats (or at least getting your company to do it for you) if you want to fly first class or business class.
It's not cheap, and as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the usual economy class fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class.

Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide have adopted many of the traditions of the holiday.
It is a tradition to be awake at Easter and watch the sunrise outdoors.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may as well be a spring and fertility ritual with pre-Christian roots.
Many traditional churches often hold a Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter holidays, with the congregation often breaking into the midnight celebration to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that came to the islands originally came swimming, flying or floating.
