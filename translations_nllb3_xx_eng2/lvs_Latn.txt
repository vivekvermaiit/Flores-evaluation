Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that was already widely accepted, but it also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's coloration was chestnut brown on the upper side and yellow carotenoid on the lower side.
This discovery also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed feature called a plume but had the other features of feathers, such as stripes and spines, the researchers concluded that the plume likely evolved later than these features.
The structure of the color patterns suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers noted that although this is a young dinosaur wing, the pattern shows the coloration of an adult bird rather than that of a baby dragon.
The researchers suggested that although this was a new dinosaur wing, the specimen showed adult discolouration rather than a baby dragon.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, early yesterday, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for could be caused by the forces of attraction between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon affects the Earth, causing tidal changes, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is contained in a kind of halo around the galaxy, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, elections have never been very technological: voters enter the polling booth, place a printed page with the candidate they want in the envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The French electoral law provides for fairly strict rules on the procedure for the withdrawal of a candidate.
Since the 1988 elections, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that they are free of envelopes at the start of the elections and that no envelopes are attached to them except those of duly registered and authorised voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each stage of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following the established procedures.

Four female skiers did not finish their runs and 45 of the 117 skiers did not finish on the leaderboard.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Aria said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused came to the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services pulled the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Adderbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been remanded in custody by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony is likely to be futile because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and courts have considered the publication of the photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists seem to be playing on the plan by publishing photos and other information of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for the prosecution as a whole, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the time of the indictment.
According to the leaked document, it will address the border dispute that Palestine wants, based on the border situation before the 1967 Middle East war.
The two leaders also discussed Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, the future of Jerusalem, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of the agreement, but PI agrees to such a presence for only five years.
The forests had to be carefully managed by the shooters participating in the additional pest control trial, as this trial was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
The NPWS and NSW partnership and the NSW Hunting Programme have recruited qualified volunteers.
According to information provided by Mika O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Cultural Heritage at the National Park and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation underwent comprehensive safety briefing and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday by the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martell's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission encouraged CEP's earlier resignation as part of a package of measures designed to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was in Martelly in response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Occasionally, violent protests have led to the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating, resulting in a total of six fires, in which four people suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reports that it is aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI said that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-essential".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The quake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been released so far, but at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers, were quickly released.
The photographer later replaced an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Ligin followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligin began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research shows that after the hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also respected by other chickens, who were her fellow prisoners.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night the two moons were visible. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Rannell, known as "Goldust", commented that "Luna was as weird as I am...maybe even weirder...I loved her and I miss her...I think she's in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This is the view of 34 percent of those surveyed who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The survey's conflicting results show that 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have cast doubt on his fitness.
He was not allowed to take pain medication because it is a banned anti-inflammatory in these games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever found.
By early February, the discovery had been verified by several people using various hardware and software, and was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets brought water to Earth along with organic matter that can make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because cometary collisions with the Earth happened a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is believed to be a candidate in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow the aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of pilots with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional vehicles are planned, the tram will not stop at Wembley Stadium and parking and sleeping and walking facilities will not be available at the site.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University (U.S.A.) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer, given the interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's frog (Geospiza fortes) and the migratory cactus frog (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be used in all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very fine shapes.
It can be stretched out like a small thread, and then it can be folded and sewn together, or it can be rolled up or shaped into sheets.
It can be made very flat and attached to another metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red clover juice.
The color of the capsicum juice changes according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen (H in the compound pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been separated by electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then with clean, wet hands, squeeze them into the beaker.
The moisture in your hand will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
The remains of sewage systems have been found in homes in the town of Minoas, Crete, and on the island of Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths, where men and women would go together in mixed society.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
In space, a satellite receives a call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere has blocked some of our light and vision.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, a giant rocket must be launched more than 100 feet into the air.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing that the wheel has done for us is make transportation much easier and faster.
This has given us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Then there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and turtles.
Finally, there are many small cats (including the house cat) that eat much more of a variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche - a specific task that each cat performs that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called herds.
The litter consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and their young.
Mothers are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion cubs behave similarly to wolves or dogs  both of these animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats)  and are just as deadly to their victims.
The athletic tiger can crawl (though not very well), swim, leap, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can bark.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's full voice, but more like a sentence of a clanging, slurred word.
Ocelots love to eat small animals, and when given the chance, they will catch monkeys, pigs, rodents, and birds - almost all of the animals they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent, using tracks left on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and are also very nimble, so they hunt their prey by moving around and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if they move down a mountain slope or river or move to a new island so that they cannot move back so easily), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to compete more strongly than they should have before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, they become less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered one species.
We call this process speciation, which just means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain their nutrients from the sun by means of photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the largest predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws contained over 70 sharp teeth, with additional teeth in the mouth, and no one who came across it had a chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but it probably had a tongue like a dagger, and it probably fed on armadillos, big fish, other molasses, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, which a giant dinosaur like a T. rex couldn't handle.
While most of the Roman food is familiar to us, they also had some strange and unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and rodents called squirrels.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, whereas the rich men enjoyed communal banquets, at which they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine certainly did not include foods that were imported into Europe from the Americas or Asia only in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate the flesh of a turtle.
The Babylonians built a temple to serve as a principal dwelling place for each of their gods.
The people brought offerings to the gods, but the priests tried to supply the gods' needs by holding ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then the inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
Most Jewish families lived outdoors.
Women cooked in the backyard; shops were simple, empty sheds facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so the wood was very expensive.
The Old Norse sagas tell that Erik Rudi was banished from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, discovered a land he called Greenland.
But despite his discovery, a tribe of Eskimos was already living there.
Although each was a "Scandinavian" country, the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed greatly.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a label on the back, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words: "In the original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is visible in the lower part of the document, inverted.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after it was written.
So the note is probably just attached as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was run by the "Overseas French", the French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of going to war with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture made up of an extremely large group of people who live and work in cooperation with one another, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also defines the size of a society.
The city-states are the ancestors of nations.Culture of civilization means the transmission of knowledge across generations, the influence of culture and its steady spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence behind, and they are not recognized as fully-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States, based on the Articles of Confederation, established for the first time a weak central government, whose only component was the Congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and in the absence of any national executive or judicial power, it relied on government agencies, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all the laws it passed.
It also did not have the power to repeal tax legislation and tariffs between countries.
The amendment of the articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, but the states were so lax with the central government that their representatives often did not appear.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, having also won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, rowing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in both international and Olympic games.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan is often called an archipelago because of its many islands
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors spelling the island's name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island, arrived.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the local people's grain-growing practices and employing Chinese laborers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereign control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intuit, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally came to be.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most common size of photographic film in the era of analogue photographic film.
It's still being made, but more importantly, its image proportions are now being used in the image formats of digital camera sensors.
The 35mm format is actually, slightly confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the ratio of the edges of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format set) conform to these edge relationships or are very similar to them.
The much-distorted and often-dismissed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining the order of the image.
It states that the most efficient location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, fell into disrepute.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite their differences in language and tradition.
Its all-pervasive power affected everyone, from the king down to the common people.
One of the central doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are designed to do just that.
The centralization of power and money in the church of Rome over a thousand years ago has led many to question whether this principle has been observed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began blockading the German fleet.
The strategy proved effective in cutting vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering any part of the ocean that threatened even neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the majority of the population and the nation considered pacifism and isolationism to be the most important.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a repeat of that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to begin work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his previous employer) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each stage of China's development or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
There was also a period of unstable provincial division between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Yin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought bitterly for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the top spot in the Great Wall of China.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to one ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, all male candidates were allowed to apply, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true in the military field, for military ranks were now awarded on the basis of merit rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in the affairs of the world, and he often went to the cave that became known as Hira ala Nora (the mountain of light) to make his request.
The very beer that has survived the ravages of time is a shining example of Muhammad's spiritual appetite.
Located on a mountain ridge north of Mecca, it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
Nothing more than clear, beautiful skies above and many mountains all around is visible.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many giant pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, is made up of several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Heops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor Heops' wives and family members.
the upper box shall look like a V and the lower box shall look like a rectangle or a square with no lower edges.
Up means you should start from the stern and press down on the bow, down means you should start at the handle (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull down on the bow.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, whereas the downward movement is stronger and more convincing.
You may mark your own notes, but remember that the printed notes are for the benefit of the music, so they should generally be followed.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by the market wives.
With the cavalry in tow, they returned to Paris, spreading threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the floats wide.
At one point, a member of the gang was dragging the head of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles before the frightened queen.
The cost of the US imperialist war in the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds on behalf of the Philippine government flowed through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines, the people of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the environment that inspired the order.
The period in which the events occurred is commonly called the Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and the Middle Ages were followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice covers a wide range of ideas, from the trend of technology or technological imperative to the strict understanding that human destiny is guided by underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their expression in technologies.
In most interpretations of technological determinism, two main ideas are distinguished: the development of technology itself largely occurs outside of cultural or political influence, and technology itself creates an "impact" on societies, and this impact is induced rather than socially conditioned.
For example, the car certainly contributes to the development of roads.
However, the public road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, and new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs associated with the use of cars.
The large number of private cars also means a higher rate of accidents, leading to new methods of repair in health care.
Romanticism had a lot of cultural determinism, which came from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Sch√§chel.
In the Romantic context, geography influenced people, and over time, there was a culture and a vision associated with the geographical region that was superior to arbitrary laws imposed because it was in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris is now considered the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known as a center of luxury goods from about 400 C.E. to about 1100.
Its status diminished in the 12th century, as the crusaders returned with gifts of jewelry and spices that were valued above those available in Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that Constantinople lost its title of fashion capital, but Paris gained it.
The Gothic style gained popularity in the 10th-11th centuries and later in the 14th century.
Early clothing was largely influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication channels, fashion in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great developments of that time was the use of the bagpipes as a means of reinforcing clothing, as a result of the Crusades.
A subsistence farming is a farming that is carried out to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds harvested in an ecoregion together with manure or other comparatively simple methods to maximise yields.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient, as is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of participants.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often emphasise their ownership by using a distinctive and symbolic style, including fashions, manners and slang.
One of the most common techniques used to illustrate the importance of socialization is the failed case of children whose parents did not provide socialization for them while they were growing up because of neglect, difficulty, or malice.
Some of the wild children have been confined by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, this child's abandonment was due to the parents rejecting the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have suffered serious violence or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised with animals, a feral child exhibits nearly the same behaviors (with physical limitations) as the animal in question, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, but it is a step forward.
The voting approach is not a learning method but rather a support tool for people learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Voting can be done both virtually and in real life, in other words, as a teacher can be a support, but just as well a little human being in Microsoft Office.
Virtual meetings are internalised in software and are designed to ask, explain and explain procedures that might be difficult for a student to solve on their own.
Children are put into foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even eviction.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and educational, yet it is happening.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
The widows must be provided with all the necessities that were missing in the homes from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet create additional dimensions in terms of approaches to use and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are cited as important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In studying the target audience's reaction to sites, Immy and McCord (1998) also identified 'personal engagement' and 'persistent relationships' as new motivating aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions - facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions on the face.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are still able to determine precisely how much of it is true.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have such a capacity to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, but selection removes it from the set of variations expressed.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shifted the variation back and forth between these two sets.
Primates with digestive systems like humans have difficulty obtaining the necessary amino acids from the plant resources available in the savanna.
Moreover, it can have serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins found in the leaves and the stems, but it's hard for primates like us to digest them unless they're prepared.
In contrast, animal foods (eels, termites, oysters) are not only easily digested but also rich in protein, containing essential amino acids.
With all of this in mind, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors also solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally falling asleep during normal sleep, followed by a brief period of falling back asleep (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet stimulus so that you are aware but not fully aroused.
If you switch the clock during sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, causing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known to be diuretic) before bedtime to get you up and go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace a person has is the inverse of the amount of stress in his body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive life force there is, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that's keeping us from achieving it is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has expanded on the Mahayana path of love and many of the yoga practices of India.
The basic structure of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it involves Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to all-encompassing love.
During the practice of Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini (Enlightenment) energy is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Divine Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and this led to the establishment of cooperation between the USSR and the United States, and after the war, because of the different systems, processes and cultures, these countries became hostile again.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and with the help of newly trained armies, real warfare was conducted on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenders had been beaten, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans were morally obsolete in a matter of days, when more than 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers arrived and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships to transport goods remains the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods while impeding the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
Meanwhile, the German fleet, using submarines as its main means of transport, tried to stop the flow of traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would have probably invaded Britain along with all the other European countries.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient peoples and tribes began to cultivate them for their milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and were tended by goat herders, often children or adults, similar to the more common sheep herders, and these herding methods are still used today.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse railway consisted of only parallel wooden rails, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than the gravel roads of the time.
The use of the ladders was initially to keep the tracks stationary, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be even more efficient if they had a metal roof on top.
This became the usual practice, but the iron caused a greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of movement was walking, and humans began to walk upright about two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Two-legged individuals have been found in the fossil record of the Australopithecus superfamily from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although members of the Sahelanthropidae family may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want to just have a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of man's scientific and technological advances, and problems have been made more serious by human overpopulation and extravagant living.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, the draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies of what are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" (Declaration of Independence) were produced during the night.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Palace on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 The "Dunlap Broadsides", known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet, birds still have many features that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have legs with hooks and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or  in computer language, for bits.
Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general to require no immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open drug or toxic household chemistry containers.
Read the first aid instructions for the particular container on the label.
The term "vaboul" is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient association with bed bugs, which are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predatory and blood fleas are parasitic pests that have adapted to live in the environment or have invaded other bodies.
With an estimated 400,000 cases of MS reported in the United States, it is considered the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
The couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents lose parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works by using the scientific method, and in fact, this method is the driving force behind most scientific research.
There's also experimentation, and an experiment is a test that's used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted by all the sciences, including psychology.
As Greek became less and less widely known, the Western world was alienated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The variability of endogenous cycles and their formation process, in terms of the biological clock, often has a decisive influence on many observed rhythms in psychology and behaviour.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been confirmed for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate freely even without external triggers.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material unit and whether the affected cells are stem cell line cells.
Only mutations in the stem cell line can be passed on to children, but mutations in other cells can cause cell damage or cancer.
Nature tourism connects people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
These places can be used for activities such as hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, or visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, a visit to the island of Borneo to take photographs and see orangutans.
Every morning, people from small rural towns drive to their workplaces, and others arrive in their place, whose workplaces are in the area they have just left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supports the transport system based on private cars.
Now scientists are pointing out that an economy with such high carbon emissions has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has underpinned human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and participates in transport systems.
In developed lands, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges that are broken.
Why do we have such complaints about transportation systems, why do they have problems every day, are transportation engineers incompetent, or is the root of the problem deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their possible interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is not possible to predict the driver's behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is usually quite consistent, so that some consistency can be established for their traffic flows and they can be approximately calculated mathematically.
To better reflect traffic flow, relationships are established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and processes of the transport infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier to evade predators and to find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings backward, extending them over the entire body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot replace their wings today are the multibranched and the monotremes.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought otherwise - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it holds more than eight times the amount of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, six miles wide in some places.
The Amazon provides 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from all the world's rivers.
The Amazon basin covers 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) and draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Great Pyramid of Giza, for its size and engineering excellence, was not to be surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New World admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language of most of the country's workers, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the chemical elements gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are all found in nature in free form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more specific elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
In principle, alloys are mixtures of two or more metals, and remember, the periodic table contains many chemical elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
Alloys containing a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon may also be present.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a single dot at the end of this sentence would be made up of trillions of atoms.
Thus, when the seal was first introduced, it was a good friend to many people.
Sadly, as new writing styles were introduced, the symbol's status declined and its use decreased.
Now people write reports on a computer screen, and there's no need for a founder.
We can only imagine how the keyboard will change as new inventions come along.
The atomic bomb works by requiring energy to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a way, it's like a heavy wheel being rolled up a hill, and when you split the nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and that means they tend to share a little bit of excitement or just like that.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the ice is about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is thinner below the basaltic plain and thicker below the highlands.
The nearer side could have more of the Moon's sea, because the mantle is thinner, and the lava would have been easier to lift to the surface.
Content theory is basically trying to figure out what inspires people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized by adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslov's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Usually, managers who take over their former colleagues can exhibit two types of behavior: On one end of the spectrum, they are eager to maintain their "own" status.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, the leader becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done up to this point and turn it into a personal achievement.
Ultimately, the leader is fully responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This often creates friction between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their live physical group.
They often have more autonomy than ordinary team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (page 109, Larson and LaFasto book, published in 1989) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each participant reports.
Why would an organisation want to invest time in the process of creating such a time-consuming learning organisation?
If all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organisation, creativity and innovation can emerge.
As a result, a process in which the organisation works together to overcome a barrier can facilitate the creation of a new, innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can innovate, leaders need to create a culture of innovation and an organisation that shares knowledge and is constantly learning.
Eindhjel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research, and therefore narrow the field of study and make it more precise.
Scientists are supported in their research by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is largely associated with science fiction, it is an extremely important branch of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning and adaptation of intelligent technologies.
In AI research, machines are made to automate tasks that require programmed action.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer questions and make diagnoses, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These cases have become separate sectors focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are embedded in many home computer and video game software applications.
A field trip is a large part of the learning process, and often the teacher will be happy to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual learning tours, where students can sit with classmates and view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire fine art.
Sharing a virtual learning tour is a great way to discuss the trip and share the experience with subsequent classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett's school in North Carolina create a website for their trip to the state capital, and every year, this website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as a history album.
Although often, when students first start writing an emuar, they do not pay attention to grammar and spelling, the presence of readers usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical of the target audience, the author of the e-mail begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Moreover, writing an emuar "allows students to learn more about the world around them". The need to keep readers interested motivates students to be curious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Emails are a technique that promotes collaboration and encourages students to learn outside of school hours.
The appropriate use of emus "can encourage students to become more analytical and critical. e active use of online materials allows students to define their own positions in the context of other written content and to express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, with numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is the Niagara Falls, and further north is the pristine landscape of Muscowa and much more.
All of these and many more things make Ontario what others consider to be the real Canada.
The vast areas farther north are sparsely populated, and in some places there are virtually no inhabited wilderness areas.
A population comparison that surprises many: The number of African-Americans in the United States is far greater than the number of Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and when it comes to wildlife, it's like a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France, and are known as luxury-class beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the Comoros and Mayotte, on a large scale.
European influence and colonization reached its zenith in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India along the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bordered by the Sahel region in the north and by the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: All women travellers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to take off a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that because of cultural differences, there may be situations that they may view as harassment, and it is not unusual for a woman to be followed, shoved behind her back, and so forth.
Don't be afraid to reject men and their attention (whether it's cultural differences or not, it's not acceptable anyway).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meronites used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casabranca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan renamed the city Dar al-Badi, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping spots in all of Morocco.
In the old city of Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tajine, ceramic pots, leather goods, water pipes, and all kinds of knickknacks, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a popular tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the eastern border of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the volcano Njiragongo, which has destroyed most of the city's streets, especially its downtown.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be reviewed to understand the current state of the fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing the volcano of Niragongo, along some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking sites in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).
Because of its relative difficulty of access, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport make it a popular destination.
In 1990, because of the threat of sand dunes, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger.
It was one of the main locations used for filming the PBS documentary "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is a stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a variety of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, this park has daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to certain South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong, named after the island of Hong Kong, is a major destination for many tourists.
The cluster of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a shimmering striped diagram, as evidenced by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To see the best of Hong Kong, head off the island to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonists took over as their own, and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest strip of coastal mangrove in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans area is 3850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/dirt areas.
Since 1966, the Sandurbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 mountain lions in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially on the eastbound and Jakarta/Bumtang routes, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses often run between different routes, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and durable Japanese shore buses.
Shared taxi cabs offer a quick and convenient way to nearby places such as Paro (150 Bhutanese Nultrums) and Punakhu (200 Bhutanese Nultrums).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with Saint Georges de Lojapoc, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 272 feet [83 m], with a length of 1,292 feet [378 m] and two 12-foot [3.5 m] wide belts.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is planned.
The Guaran√≠ were the most important indigenous group in the eastern part of what is now Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Pacaya, who made their living by hunting, foraging, and gathering food.
Paraguay, once called the "Province of the Milky Way", was formed in the 16th century by the interaction of Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Canyetas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here several other times a year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, visit the website of the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
In the outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance to find out what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed the +30 ¬∞C mark.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but when windy and wet at the same time, they appear colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "wet" or "dry" season: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authorities, a minimum distance of 100 yards/metres must be maintained from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals!
As submissive as they may seem, bison, whales, North American gray whales, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep their distance, and because these animals are large, fierce, and potentially dangerous, it is best to keep them in small groups.
Also, remember that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking spicy food and keep your camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous 1889 naval scandal, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except the British cruiser, with nearly 200 Americans and Germans on board.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city center resulted in the assassination of Lealofi III, the supreme ruler of Tupua, Tamasa.
The two harbors of Auckland provide many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in Harbour North Province) are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and the shade is provided for the most part by the poplar trees.
Tamakidraiva Beach is located in the harbour of Waitemata, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and Senthillers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops located on the shore.
The main local beer is 'Numer one', not a strong tasting beer but a pleasant and refreshing one.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more popular.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
The term "coffee with milk" is unfamiliar to Australians, as black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is made with a giant goat's milk (not milk chickens), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're excellent.
Although the reef is visited throughout the year, injuries are rare on the reef for the reasons mentioned above.
However, listen to the authorities, pay attention to all signs and carefully follow safety warnings.
The cubed owl appears on beaches and riverbanks from October to April 1770 in the northern part of the city, and occasionally at other times.
Sharks are common, but they rarely attack humans, and most are afraid of humans and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not common in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel packages.
They can also save you the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to provide other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, a larger proportion of the audience chooses to live in tents, and most of them consider this an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to be near the epicenter of the action, you have to get up early to find a tent near the music.
Remember: Even after the music has finished playing on the main stages, there may be places at the festival where the music continues until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic in winter, check the location of the ice shelf, as ice crossing creates a rather dangerous noise for those most affected by this activity.
The cruise ships in St Petersburg provide time for sightseeing of the city.
Casinos are usually designed to keep their customers as long as possible and to make them spend more money.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and in their rooms.
Some establishments offer alcohol on a commission basis, but alcohol impairs judgment, and any good player knows the importance of keeping a clear head.
Anyone who wants to drive in the polar regions or over mountain ranges should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The snow and ice on the roads are so thin that you cannot drive as smoothly as on the asphalt.
In a blizzard, so much snow can fall in a short period of time that it can cause congestion.
Visibility may also be restricted by snowfall, hail, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, so traffic is mostly continuous throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of many visitors' lives.
The popular term "safari" refers to trips over land to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are more likely to get close to cars, so standard equipment will allow them to be seen well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes blind, and they are best seen with binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "crest walk", "safari walk", or "walking" walk) is a walk that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you had booked flights and hotels for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may have found yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but at the end of March most coronavirus-related cancellation rules are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most tickets for the events are expected to cost between ¬•2500 and ¬•130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¬•7000.
Ironing wet clothes can help to eliminate them, and many hotels may ask for ironing boards and irons if they are not available in the room.
If a glove is not available or you do not like wearing gloved socks, you can try using a trouser leg if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause it to sag or even bend in extreme situations).
There are different types of water treatment, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if in doubt, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal parasites unknown to them in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause inflammation, or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread lice, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at designated places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most challenging driving conditions, often cutting through isolated rural terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful as they have steep stairs, narrow lanes and sharp curves.
The speed limits are considerably lower than the previous and subsequent road sections  usually 3540 miles per hour (5664 km/h)  and it is even more important to observe them strictly.
But strangely, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than at other parts of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cuisine is quite enjoyable, and in Bavaria it is very rich and varied, as in its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit tubers with apple filling are available year-round, and in the summer, there are also those with cherry and plum filling.
Many German confections include almonds, walnut, and other tree nuts, and the popular cakes are especially well-suited to a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small, firm, and rich sandwiches, try the Berliner, the Pfannkuchen, or the Krapfen, depending on the region.

The spikes of the shield support the feet of the horseman, who fights on each side of the shield.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can cause safety concerns because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot gets caught in the saddle, the rider may be dragged off the ground if the horse runs away.
First, most horsemen wear riding boots with a slipper and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Further, some sails, especially English sails, have safety bars that allow the leather reinforcements of the ladder to fall off the sails, allowing the rider to fall and to roll them on their back.

Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski tourism or ski touring.
It is related to, but does not necessarily include, ski mountaineering or alpinism; in the latter case, these activities take place on steeper slopes and require more rigorous skiing and boots.
Think of a skiing route as a similar skiing route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than walking  but you will very rarely be able to reach the speed of long-distance skiing without a heavy backpack and a prepared track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling across several countries would mean countless visa applications and passport controls.
However, in this respect the Schengen area acts as one country.
It is normally possible to cross the border without re-passport control at border control points while in this territory.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen Member States separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes a product a vintage item, but some tax agencies define an antique as a product that is over 100 years old.
