This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory that is already widely held), but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenous underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a highly developed bone called the rachis, but have other features - rays and hooks - researchers have concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display.
Scientists believe that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, it is a specimen of the adult animal's plumage, not the dusty feathers of a juvenile.
A car bomb that exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system is apparently determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Based on the luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of the star is determined, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic spin.

The Iraqi study group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He warns of the impossibility of guaranteeing that any targeted activity in present-day Iraq will stop sectarian strife, escalating violence or sliding into chaos.
The report begins by calling for open debate and consensus building in the United States on Middle East policy.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the executive branch's current approach to Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that before the end of this year a new diplomatic initiative should be undertaken to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was looking for a phenomenon that would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on Earth and causes the ebb and flow of sea levels, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is around the galaxy in a sort of "square-ray" and is made up of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered an extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "highly concerning, even alarming, because of its high lethality".
Dr. Moll thinks that some of the patients may have picked up the virus at the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital orderlies.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with TB still seems low; 6,000 people out of the 330,000 infected at any one time in South Africa.

The government has also promised several million doses of encephalitis vaccine to help prepare health agencies for next year.
Vaccination plans for delivery to historically high-risk areas for this year were delayed due to lack of resources and low priority compared to other diseases.

Infrared images show how the temperature differences between day and night indicate that this is likely a cave.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal changes are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but that's consistent with being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, based in Flagstaff.
In France, voting is traditionally done without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope, listing the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law contains a fairly strict codification of the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been made transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes were in them before the voting began and that no envelopes other than those inserted by registered and authorized voters were added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness the process, and in the evenings, the votes are tallied by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the witnesses' evidence may be compromised because her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have seen the publication of the photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists seem to be walking on thin ice when they publish photographs of suspects.
The prosecutor's office, which is in charge of the criminal prosecution, has indicated to the press that no further information will be provided at least until the charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document will address border disputes in which Palestine wants to maintain the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics seem to include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the treaty is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for five years only.
The shooters were under close supervision by the rangers during the supplemental pest control study as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation with NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Sport Shooting Association), qualified volunteers were recruited under the auspices of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's Natural Heritage Conservation Department, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure of elections, and some have been ongoing since 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires, and four people died from minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The Department responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT) in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead at this time.
The six hostages, including children and elderly people, were soon released, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady because she needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that when the hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two black boxes containing flight logs on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and she died on a night with two moons in the sky, unique, like herself, a strong woman, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader, and she was a great leader,
Dustin Goldust Runnels said that Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more so... I loved her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's somewhere better.
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who disagree with Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Chief Cabinet Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign stated that she believed that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
As for the extreme views in the survey, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his objections, his eligibility was questioned.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to overcome the pain, since drugs are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to man on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of the Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth has formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political chatter and recklessness".
There's speculation that he'll try for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and carbon emissions every year.
Compared to ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more accurate information.
No emergency services will be introduced, no overhead train services will be built at Wembley, no parking facilities or park-and-ride facilities are available on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have increased the chances that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new species of birds in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process takes much longer, due to the breeding between endemic, intermediate, and migratory cactus and cone-toothed sponges.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of shapes, rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be bent and braided, melted or pressed into slices.
It can be worked to a considerable degree of thinness and fixed to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it has often been used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of the chemical, and you can make your own indicator using the juice of red cabbage.
The juice of the cabbage changes color according to how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (letter H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then make a ball of them with your clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will result in a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in ancient Rome, they were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women used to bathe together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite to make the call.
A satellite in space receives a call, and then the signal bounces back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and field of view.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, a large rocket is needed that measures over 100 feet.
The bicycle changed the world in ways that had never been seen before, and the most significant thing that it did was make transportation much easier and faster.
He brought us a train, a car, and other means of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized feline predators, feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including wild domestic cats) whose diet is dominated by small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the ecological niches system, where each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with the others.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats, living in large groups called packs.
The flock consists of one to three related adult males together with up to 30 females and young.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion pack behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump for long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can howl.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar from a full throat, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals, and when they get the chance, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smell, and by cleaning, they can tell where they have been on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and can move very quietly, and camels hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or a river, or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in a few thousand or even a few million years, these two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the emergence of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were covered with over 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set set set up on the top floor, meaning that anything that crossed its path had no chance of escaping.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had a forked tongue, and their diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water, even a large dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their meals would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual compositions of feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, squirrels, and a type of rodent called a plch.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their meals sitting on chairs, whereas rich men enjoyed feasting together, reclining on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that did not reach Europe from the Americas or Asia until later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples to each of their gods, which they considered to be their home.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, special pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurates were built.
At the top of the tower was a special sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the backyard; shops were only open counters facing the street; houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan was devoid of extensive forests, so the wood was very expensive.
The Norse sagas tell of Erik the Red being banished from Iceland for murder, and traveling further west, finding Greenland and naming it the Greenland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although all countries were part of "Scandinavia", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure Hunters, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a map to treasure.
Although the document has a label on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence contains the words Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The text is on the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is evident that the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
So it is likely that the inscription was simply added as an appendix.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles brought liberation to northern France, but the south of the country had not yet been liberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a certain culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work in cooperation with each other, i.e. together they form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and also civitas, meaning city or city state, and it also defines the size of a society in a certain way.
The ancestors of nations were city states. The culture of a civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces and the appropriate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component, subject to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state agencies, which often failed to cooperate, to enforce laws.
Nor did it have any power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states and could only be amended after that.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and in 2006 Italy won the World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic clans.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands, and the largest of them is Honshu, making Japan actually the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, it is sometimes called an "island nation" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing nearby recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning the transformation of the original grain production practices, employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the southwestern and northern coast of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main stages: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the height of the analogue film era.
They're still made today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has taken over the formats of digital camera sensors.
Although it's a bit confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio in integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and derided "rule of thirds" is a simple guideline that creates dynamics in the image while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had acquired wealth and power, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are there for that purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over 1,000 years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain was crossing international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic met with only a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited undersea military forces.
During the 1920's, pacifist and isolationist attitudes prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the U.S. with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his previous supervisor).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing between different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There were also unstable periods of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Qin dynasties.
During these periods, a ruthless war was fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the throne in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military, because instead of military ranks based on class, it's now based on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to start a revolution in their own countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the realm of worldly life, and he often visited a cave known as Hira on a mountain called Noor (Light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists, because it's completely isolated inside the cave.
There is nothing to see but a beautifully clear sky and a great number of surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, very little of this world is seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The symbol 'up' looks like a V and 'down' looks like a clasp or a square with the bottom missing.
Top means you start at the tip and push the bow, bottom means you start at the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Moving upward usually produces a softer sound, while moving downward is louder and more penetrating.
You can write your own markings on the sheet with a pencil, but keep in mind that printed markings have a reason from a musical standpoint, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of shopkeepers forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Elizabeth Philippine of France, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, which was surrounded by an angry mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of a criminal gang waved the head of the royal guard at a horrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses, with the interest on the bonds flowing in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
The extra surplus value derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, be the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the formation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which most scholars believe ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology push or technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by an all-pervading logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an 'impact' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that when motorized vehicles appear, it inevitably leads to the development of roads.
But the nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, which is causing new medical techniques to be invented to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism carried within it a considerable element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geographically shaped individuals and over time, there was a rise in customs and culture associated with that geography, and these, because they were consistent with the location of the society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its importance declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders took valuables, such as silk and spices, back to Europe, at a higher price than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Early dress was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
But because of the slow pace of communication, Western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great advances of that era was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that is carried out to produce only the amount of food that meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-supply farming is a simple, often organic system using seed native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be different in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through the expressive and symbolic use of style, which includes dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on several unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some wolf children have been incarcerated for long periods (usually by their own parents), in some cases living in abandonment, because their parents rejected them due to their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma, and then been abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, while some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
In complete non-human animal education, the feral child exhibits nearly identical behaviour (within physical capabilities) to the caregiver animal, such as fear or inattention to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
The framework is not a learning method but rather a support tool that provides support to those individuals who undertake to acquire new practice, for example using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, but it's also a little bit of a Microsoft Office staple.
The software incorporates virtual constructs designed to analyse, motivate and explain procedures that might be too difficult for the student himself.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where he or she lacks proper nutrition, care, and education, but such cases do exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is intended to provide for all needs that have not been met in the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add another dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivating elements for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal engagement' and 'continued interest' were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighme and McCord (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microcommunications  facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
In particular, by correctly interpreting micro-signs, you can tell if someone is lying to you.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks suggested that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to judge sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination blur the differences between the two sets within each generation in both directions.
For primates with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet the need for amino acids from plant sources that are available in the open savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us, as for primates, to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, egg) are not only easily digestible but also provide high amounts of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Overall, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors were solving the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces a person to get up and go to the bathroom.
The degree of inner calm corresponds to the inverse of the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The less tension, the more good the life force brings, and every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, and the only thing that's standing in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple in principle, they are Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened by the postures of this yoga, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. The conflicts of system, processes and culture led to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries at the end of the war.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it really did fight with proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian front.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after the troops invaded eastern Poland, violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transportation is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional role of the navy was to ensure the ability of the state to transport people and goods, but at the same time, the navy was also to prevent the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, in which the Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the traffic, mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, then Germany would have probably been able to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often under the care of shepherds, often children or adolescents, similar to the more common shepherds of sheep.
Horse racing tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage roads were mostly parallel, they allowed the draught horses to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than other roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
The rails were introduced early to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually found that the rails were more efficient if they had a belt of iron on their surface.
This became common, but iron caused more wear on wooden carriage wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with humans starting to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestor Australopithecus did not normally walk upright.
Bipedal animals appear in Australopithecus fossils between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can live more environmentally friendly lives, join environmental movements, and even become activists.
In many cases, it's the same as symptomatic treatment, but if we're not looking for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and get rid of it.
Clearly, the world has changed a great deal because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After the July 4th Congressional resolution was passed, the handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now called "Dunlap copies".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The earliest known surviving copies of the document are the Dunlap broadsides, or 25 copies from Dunlap's printing press.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But the birds still have a lot of dinosaur-like features.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are represented as the binary digit  or in computer jargon bytes.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both cunning and cunning, bedbugs are adapted to life in the nest or home of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the leading neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, and the scientific method is, in fact, the guiding principle behind most scientific research.
But it's not experimentation per se, an experiment is a test that is used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but it's also important for scientific research to ask questions and to observe.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues its time in a free-flowing cycle even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, where they either labeled DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeled protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the germ line cells have been affected.
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people with an interest in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in their cars to go to work, and in the meantime, others pass them on their way to work, where they had just left.
This dynamic shuttle transport is a private vehicle-based transport system that everyone participates in and supports.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely see such complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail every day, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is there something deeper at work?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly to some extent; therefore, the traffic usually has a reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of transport facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly allowed them to evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their body.
This gives them a greater choice of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, they're the only insects that can't fold wings, dragonflies and stingrays.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because it doesn't look like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size or in the technical precision of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, have been known to man since ancient times because they are found in nature in their pure form and can be mined relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are a lot of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that have a small amount of nonmetallic elements in them, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a billion atoms could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
That is why the pencil has become a good friend to many people since its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing, the pencil was relegated to a lower position and secondary use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, so they're not going to be able to touch the clipboard at all.
One can only marvel at what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works by requiring energy to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like driving a heavy cart up a hill, and then by re-splitting the atomic nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the upside and about 100 km thick on the downside.
He's weaker under the sea and stronger under the mountains.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side, because the crust is thinner here, and the lava could have easily reached the surface.
Content theory is about finding out what people can relate to or are close to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt during adolescence.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two types of behaviour that can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues  peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain  one of them (or one of them).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the person is transformed beyond recognition and feels that they have to change everything the team does and do it their way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often results in disagreements between the managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as contact points for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a so-called 'invisible team' (Larson  LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
If all available resources are used effectively across the functional components of the organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be displayed.
As a result, the process of a cooperating organisation overcoming an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
To be innovative, an organisation's management must create an innovation culture, introduce knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that organisations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, narrowing and refining this area of research.
Scientists in their research are promoting the interconnectedness between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that can help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations in science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is embedded in a number of home computer applications and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of every course, and the teacher would often like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Virtual sharing of field trips is also a great way to think about the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year, they revise the website, but the old versions stay online and serve as an album.
Blogging can also improve students' written language, and while their blogging is often marked by sloppy spelling in the beginning, the influence of other readers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also encourages students to have an overview of the world around them. e need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and inspires students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs 'allows students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and formulate their view on specific topics' (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lie Niagara Falls, and further north, the beauties of Muskoka and beyond are still waiting to be discovered.
All of this and more underscores that Ontario is a place where foreigners are considered a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people are surprised to learn that the United States has more African-Americans than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in terms of wildlife, it can be considered a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are attached to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, and it was successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers report as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (just be careful not to make it look too expensive).
Women should bear in mind that because of cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter harassment and that it is not unusual for a man to follow a woman as she walks, hold her hand, and so forth.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences do not justify this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, and abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar l-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of cotton goods, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well thought out given the current state of fighting that continues to take place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and offers one of the cheapest mountain gorilla watching in Africa.
To travel around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi), which costs about 500 CFA francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Timbuktu is now a poor city, but its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, as has its airport.
In 1990, the desert sands were added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS television show The Wonders of the African World, hosted by Henry Luis Gates.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the country, because it feels more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of the JAR and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is an entrance fee and a nature conservation contribution.
Also beneficial may be the purchase of a Wild Card, which allows entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which many tourists consider to be a major destination.
The array of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a sparkling column chart reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best view of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head for the opposite coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of the dense urban development on Hong Kong Island is located on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the site that was taken over by the British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest strip of coastal mangrove in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stretches of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans area covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water bodies or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian Axis tigers can currently be found in the area.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, we recommend that you buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 273 feet [83 m], the bridge is 1,292 feet [378 m] long, and it has two 12-foot [3.5 m] wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the area now known as eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held at other times of the year.
If you're interested in tournaments and where to get tickets to polo matches, look at the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but you may be able to use British and American currency.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so make the exchange before you leave.
Because Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer here when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures in the summer months are commonly above 30 °C (98 °F).
Winters can be treacherously cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but with the wind and humidity, it seems colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, they are still wild animals in the wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
Despite their peaceful appearance, buffalo, deer, moose, bear, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because of the lack of proper distancing, and these animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, bear in mind that bears and other wild animals attract odors, so avoid carrying or cooking spicy foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of the infamous Naval Standoff of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with nearly 200 Americans and Germans killed.
During the independence movement organized by the Mau, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the assassination of the Supreme Chairman, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, given that Auckland lies between two harbours, and the most popular beaches are found in three areas.
The North Shore (in North Harbour District) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming opportunities, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located off the Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after Mission Bay and St. Heliers districts of central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is the Number One, which is not a complex beer but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines you can have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Drinking water from the tap is fine here, but if you are afraid, bottled water is usually available.
To Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "little black" is an "espresso", a cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're top-notch.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Still, follow the advice of the authorities, follow the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The four-lined grouper occurs near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of Seventeen Seventy, and occasionally can be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
The sea crocodile does not live actively in the ocean, its primary refuge being the estuary north of the town of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives travellers the assurance that they will have a place to stay at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but other forms of accommodation, such as camping, can also be booked through them.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even a combined airline and hotel package.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think things over or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any adjustments or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel address.
In the case of some festivals, a substantial majority of visitors choose to camp on site and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of the action, you'll need to arrive as soon as possible to get a camping spot that's close to the music production.
Remember, while the music on the main stage may have ended, other sections of the festival may continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as navigation through the ice causes intolerable noise in exposed areas.
The St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city.Passengers on the cruises are not subject to visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually try to keep guests in as much time and money as possible, and often lack windows and clocks, often making it difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment options to keep visitors in a good mood and on the casino floor.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the premises, but drunkenness adversely affects judgment, so all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitude or in a mountain pass was advised to consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as well as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow falls in a very short time to make it impossible for you to drive.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or by precipitation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and for many tourists it represents the highlight of the trip.
The term safari, in its familiar sense, refers to a journey by land to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to vehicles, so standard equipment will allow for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can better observe them with a telescope.
A tourist safari consists of a walking tour lasting from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in different locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the event in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the delay notice, this situation may be difficult for you.
The cancellation policies may vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not apply to the July 2020 Olympic Games.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing moist clothing can help dry him out, and many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for rent, even if it is not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like to wear socks with ironing, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause clotting or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water takes only a minute; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, you should buy bottled water from a trusted company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to their home regions.
Troublesome insects can cause food spoilage, skin irritation, or worse, allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill a person are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and other duties in the areas concerned.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont on the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging to drive, as it often passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep corners, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are common.
The maximum speed limit is considerably lower than in the preceding and following sections  usually 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and its strict observance is even more important.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service here is far better than in many sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rich and varied, much like their southern neighbors in Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples used all year round, followed by cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds and hazelnuts and other nuts.
If you want to taste some rich sweets, try desserts called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made of various herbs, spices, and meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either dry or wet depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry. In southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term usually refers to cuisine originating from central and eastern Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, contains many simple flavored dishes, with peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices predominating in flavor.
The bars that hang on either side of the saddle serve as support for the rider's feet.
They provide greater stability for riders, but may be associated with safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse but his foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts running, the rider may pull behind him.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft sole that is quite narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety skis that allow the harness belt to fall off the saddle when the rider pulls behind it.
Chochamo Valley  The Chilean prime minister's favorite mountaineering destination known as South America's Yosemite, where vast granite walls and cliffs can be found.
The peaks of the mountains offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes thanks to the endless potential of the walls.

Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with a number of independent countries.Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area functions in this respect in a similar way to a single country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques, although some tax agencies define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.

Back currents are returning waves that crash onto a beach, often at the site of a reef, etc.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and that's where the fast current into the deep water can be created.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head for a place where you won't be swept away again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted, wait for help.

The only way to make this go faster is to send the item as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most common way to fly first or business class is to pull out a fat wad of cash (even better is to get your company to do it for you).
