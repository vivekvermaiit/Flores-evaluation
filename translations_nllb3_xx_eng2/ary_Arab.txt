This does not only confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils generally do not, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the animal's feathers were brownish-brown on the upper side and pale or carotenoid on the lower side.
The discovery provides an explanation for the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a major evolutionary chain, they are called vertebrae, but they have other features of feathers - such as protuberances and small bumps - that researchers have found the vertebrae to be likely evolutionary products of later evolutionary development.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but to reflect heat. The researchers suggest that this is probably a small dinosaur feather from the sample as well as feathers from an adult bird rather than a chicken.
Researchers speculate that this is probably a tiny dinosaur footprint outside the specimen showing adult bird feathers rather than chickens.

This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice serves differently, and courts have considered that the publication of the images could have come from one party at the expense of another.
Professor Pamela Ferguson said that "journalists are at risk of being exposed to images or material that is suspicious".
The Crown Office that is generally responsible for allegations told reporters that no further comment would be forthcoming until at least the indictment had been made.
The leaked document states that the document establishes the borders of the Palestinian territories based on the borders that existed before the 1976 Middle East war.
Among the topics discussed were the future of Jerusalem as a holy city for both peoples and the Jordan Valley dispute.
Israel demands a ten-year military presence in the area, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a five-year one.
It was only for the forestry experts to follow the archery that the complementary pest control experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers are selected under the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS, the four fishermen selected to conduct the first hunt received all safety instructions and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the 9-member Provisional Electoral Council (SEP).
This is the fifth by-election for Martelly in four years.
The Electoral Commission said last month that the resignation of the provisional electoral council was part of steps to push the country to new elections.
The formation of the committee was Martelly's response to the spread of anti-regime demonstrations that began in October
The failure to hold elections has led to demonstrations that have been held a few times, including in 2011.
About 60 incidents of iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in at least six fires and four minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving devices.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that the first of its reports of the 34 additional active incidents identified by the company is " not serious ".
The Ministry replied that the delay in Apple's report was "extremely regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 am local time (9:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Department said there were no casualties.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took a Hong Kong tourist hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were taken and at least six have died so far.
Six hostages including the youngest hostages, the oldest people and even the Filipino photographers were released early.
Take two towels to a one-to-ten-mile walk to the bathroom. Move to a cart in the window.
Go down the Legends Road and turn right at the medicine man .
He trained as a gynaecologist and then began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
As a hospital worker, Leggins began to investigate the problem of premature birth during his free time.
His research showed that when given one of the hormones it accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Shinhwa said government investigators found two false passports on board the flight on April .
Even their wrestlers thanked us.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was a great wrestler. My manager Luna died one night as unique as her mother".
Dustin " The Goldfinch " Runnels commented: " Since she was as eccentric as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I wish she were in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, dissent for Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points from 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic to end the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared the same opinion, that they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In terms of the contrasts in opinion, 29% of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, but 31% think Australia should not be a republic at all.
An Olympian had to swim 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle in three stages to win a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints his physique was in doubt.
He cannot take his own pain medicine because it is forbidden in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number up to the date of January 25.
Many people confirm that they will discover various gadgets and software in early February and announce it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water delivered to Earth along with organic material that could be proteins and support life.
Since comets collide with the Earth, scientists have sought to understand how planets form and, in particular, how the Earth is formed.
Comey, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and empty words".
He is likely to run for president in 2016.
The FAA says NextGen is a system that will make airplanes fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to determine the location of aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more precise information.
There will be no carriage access and the tram is not closed at Wembley, and there are no above ground parking spaces.
Concerns over lack of transportation have led to the possibility that the match will be played behind closed doors, without fans.
A study published Thursday in Science reports a new species of bird has become orphaned in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador .
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have said the new species evolved in less than two generations, but the journey is taking longer due to cross-breeding between Darwin's resident Geospiza parrot and the migratory cactus bird, Geospiza connerostris.
Gold can take many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled by a thin wire and can be folded and stitched. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin, and is glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to cover hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the chemical ' s hydrogen number . You can make an index using maple syrup .
The color of lettuce juice varies depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical compound.
The acidity level is defined as the ratio of hydrogen ions (H in pH) to a substance to be treated in a chemical assay.
Hydrogen ions are protons bound by electrons (as hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the beads together and with two hands form a ball.
The liquid in your hand will react with the outer layers and become funnier and turn into a cookie.
The cities of Harba and Mohenjo-Daro have bathrooms and soaps in every house connected by a complex exchange system.
Remains of sewerage systems have been found in the interior of the cities of Minoan Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Baths were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the bath was a public bath in which men and women mingled.
You can make a call to someone thousands of miles away using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and returns it instantly.
A rocket launched a satellite into space. Scientists use a telescope in space after the Earth's atmosphere lost our light and sight.
It takes a large rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
This is because light coming into the glass where the metal end of the ball is located can cause a severe electrical shock if you touch the inside of the glass or the base of the ball while it is still slightly stuck to the glass.
We have trains , cars and many other means of transportation.
Below her (smaller than her) are cats of medium size and her prey is of medium size like deer and hare.
Finally, a number of feline species (including the domesticated cat louse) eat smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Status is the attribute that gives them success, and it is in the shot that one stands apart from the competition of others.
Lions are the most social of the cats as they live in social groups.
A lion's mane is a three-toed sloth with a family link of about thirty spots and a tail.
The twins are always related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Black lions behave like packs of wolves and dogs are animals that resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are highly predatory towards their prey.
The tiger is considered an all-round athlete who can climb (though not quite as well), swim and jump great distances and pull five times as much as a human.
The tiger is in the same group as the Panthera genus as are the lion, tiger, and American jaguar.
These four cats are the only ones that can roar. A tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar in a full voice but some words (not a whole sentence) have a howl (like a cat) but it is a purr.
The carnivore eats small animals. It preys on monkeys, lizards, rodents, and birds to find food. The animals it hunts are almost all smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the protozoan follows and encounters prey in the air and in the water wherever it is on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move well in stealth. Dwarf tigers hunt their prey by contacting it and then attacking it.
When a small group of organisms separates from its original species where it came from (e.g. by moving across mountains, through a valley, or to an island from which it cannot return), it will often find itself in a different environment from the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new housing will need different features or housing modifications than the previous one to make a strong competitor.
The natives have not been changed, they have the same adaptations as the first ones.
As time passes and new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will be so different that they cannot be said to be of the same species.
We call this process speciation, which refers to the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable process and a very necessary part of evolution.
Plants take in oxygen that humans ingest into their lungs and take in carbon dioxide that they exhale (breathe in air).
The plants feed off the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our houses are built with plants, our clothes are made with plants, and most of the food we eat is also plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaur was the strongest predator of its time and feared nothing but its own skin.
The long jaws were studded with over 70 visceral teeth and one additional set of teeth in the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing could escape it if it got in its way.
We're not sure, but it probably had a single, bifurcated tongue and ate only turtles, mackerel, and other fish, and it may have eaten human flesh.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex is incapable of it.
Although many of the dishes of the Romans are probably familiar to us, they have some unusual holiday ingredients, such as the lobster, the sausage, the chicken and a type of pork called the zucchini.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals seated in chairs, the rich men preferred to run shows with each other and eat their meals lying on their sides.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include the types of dishes that would be brought to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Romans had any turkey.
The Babylonians built their gods a central temple that was considered the house of the gods.
People may bring offerings to the gods and priests may attend to the needs of the gods during festivals and celebrations.
Each temple has an open courtyard with an inner courtyard that can only be entered by priests.
Some pyramids have a special shape like towers called zakur and are built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was the god's safe haven.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, home is of little importance.
Most Jewish life was outside the home.
The women were well-behaved in the street; they had shops that opened across the street. They were serving stone to build.
Timber was expensive in Canada, so there were no big forests.
Greenland has been sparsely populated by humans. In Norse epics, Erik the Red is said to have fled Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it that.
Regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there before.
Although the countries were Scandinavian, there were also significant differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you'll know that a treasure map is inscribed on the back of the Statue of Liberty.
But that's not true. If there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776". The inscription was on the bottom of the page, reversed.
Although no one is certain who wrote it, it was a large manuscript document (about 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) that was wrapped for safekeeping.
So often the symbol is added to the base as a label.
The military campaigns of the following days and battles liberated the north of France but not the south.
It was ruled by the French Vichy. These Frenchmen made peace with Germany in 1940 and served the colonists instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies entered southern France, in an invasion dubbed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French troops had liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work together, in a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, also, which in some sense determines the size of society.
Autonomous cities are the ancestors of nations.Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, and a cultural footprint that preserves and disseminates knowledge in an equitable manner.
Small civilizations often disappear without leaving any visible traces and fail to be considered pure civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole element - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to tax, and because it had no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, it has no authority to override interstate tax laws and tariffs.
The laws required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be enacted and the states concerned themselves with the central administration because their representatives were absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, handball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Sports are also very popular in the northern regions where Italians compete for international games and Olympic medals.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the Japanese island group/cluster, Japan is often called, from a geographical perspective, an "archipelago"
Taiwan was established in the 15th century when European sailors began to arrive at Kaedō near the beautiful island of Formosa.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change native grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers to serve in rice and sugar mills.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and Taiwan was proclaimed a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three buildings: the Intehuatana , the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Room .
Most of the buildings along the promenade have been restored to give tourists a glimpse of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues today.
For example, the most common motion picture format in the world is 35 mm, the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
Its production continues to this day, but most importantly the image sensor architecture of digital cameras inherits its image aspect ratio.
The size 35 mm is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
This is why the ratio of width to height for this format (divided by twelve to find the simplest integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Most formulas (for example APS) are at or near this ratio.
The oft-misused and often-derided rule of thirds is one guiding principle that creates dynamism and maintains order in photography.
The most striking feature of the central subject, she says, is the intersection of the lines dividing the triangle vertically and horizontally (see illustration).
A Catholic Church, which became wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has kept the European nations together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
Her overwhelming power impressed many of the king's courtiers and commoners.
Among the beliefs of the church is that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty and that the church's material support is directed towards this end.
For over a thousand years, the church in Rome had the central authority, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
A good-service strategy, it seizes military supplies and civilians, but this blockade is one violation of the internationally accepted law in many of the agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain blocked international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire sections of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral shipping.
Since there was limited response with this tactic, Germany's expectations were similar to that of unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a different way of presenting different time periods; each of China's phases or each ruling family was considered a distinct dynasty.
Also among each dynasty was an era of relative instability for the divided provinces. Among the most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a fierce war for the throne raged among several nobles.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying or fighting for the top spot in the Great Hall at Xi'an.
There are many socio-political implications of the regime in question, from the transition from an absolute republic to nationalism and the idea that the people own the country and not the ruler.
Also after the revolution, all jobs were open to men and only people with more ambition and success succeeded.
The same applies to soldiers who are no longer in the rank of staff sergeant but in the rank of colonel.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was interested in things beyond this earthly life. He would go to meditate alone in the unknown "Hara" on the mountain of "Al-Nour" (the Light).
The very zeal, which has survived through the ages, provides a very vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's never easy to find even if you know it's there. Just getting into a car, you feel completely isolated.
There is nothing like a beautiful sky and clear skies and rolling mountains. Few things in this world are as visible or audible as what you can see or hear from inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Tombs" that houses the Egyptian tombs contain many pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), tombs, temples, and a large amphitheater.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the pharaohs and their families.
"Closer to the arc" is a V-shaped marking or "lower than the arc" is a staple or a minus sign.
Going up means you have to put your head down and push the bow of the camisa upwards. Going down means you have to put your head down to pull the bow and pull it upwards.
Often the arch above the vocal folds more thinly, but the arch below is stronger and more firm.
Feel free to draw your own markings in pencil, but keep in mind that printed curves exist for a musical purpose, so that's something to keep in mind.
King Louis XV, Queen Marie Antoinette and their young sons (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles) and the King's brother, Madame Elisabeth, returned to Paris on 6 October 1789 from Versailles with a group of women for health reasons.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted against the King and Queen.
People often ask the King and Queen to open the car windows.
At one point, a member of the gang beheaded a royal guard in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
However, soon a new invention would come, which would herald a period of cultural advancement in Scandinavia, the Bronze Age.
The Filipino people paid for the war expenses of the US imperialist invasion of the Philippines themselves. They were required to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the offices of banks on Wall Street.
The enormous profits from the exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, the main gains of American imperialism.
In the late Middle Ages, Europe began to develop its own horses and one of the major developments at this time towards the Crusades was the use of horses to harness horses.
The era in which the events occurred is referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is known to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a push for technology or technological necessity to a strong sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is tied to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development in and of itself is necessarily one-way rather than one-way of cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are more hereditary than socially cohesive.
For example, one could argue that the automobile engine necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, establishing a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Large car ownership leads to a high accident rate which in turn leads to the development of new health technologies to treat disabled bodies.
Romanticism had many elements of cultural determinism that came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture associated with geography emerged, and these, being more consistent with the location of a community, outweighed the arbitrary imposition of laws.
Paris is famous as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, while Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was famous as a center of luxury from 400 AD and remained so until 1100 AD.
It declined in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with valuable gifts such as silk and incense from the Byzantine markets.
Paris was then dubbed the capital of fashion, replacing Constantinople.
Gothic reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
At first the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, patterns in the West may break down in about 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Europe began to develop its own horses, and one of the major developments of the time, towards the Crusades, was that people began to use horses to make clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming that is geared to produce enough food to meet the individual needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is an easy, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Most farmers have historically worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by the norms of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, race, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Individuals of a subculture often distinguish themselves by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which can be in mannerisms, gestures, and accents.
One way of showing the importance of social development is by looking at cases of children who have suffered neglect, poverty or intentional abuse and who were not integrated into society by adults when they were growing up.
These children are called "savages" when savage children are held captive by persons (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment is due to the parents' refusal to treat the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have been abused in childhood or severely traumatized before being abandoned or escaping.
Two others are said to have been adopted by the animals; one grew their head in the wild.
When a forest mammal is raised by animals, the mammal exhibits behaviors (at the limits of physical capabilities) that are very similar to those of a domesticated animal, such as fear or repugnance towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding technology is making it more so.
Ladder technology is not a learning method but rather offers help to individuals who are embarking on a new learning experience such as using a new tool or starting a new project.
The technology of scaffolding can be virtual or virtual, in which case the Microsoft Office desktop or laptop is a scaffold.
The virtual learning supports are led by a logical person who asks questions, corrects and explains steps that might be difficult for the student to manage on their own.
The reason why children are placed in foster care varies from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child grows up in an environment that does not provide them with nutrition, care and education, but some do.
We understand that charity is the safest place for this rodent.
Our welfare system must provide safe homes, caring care providers, a stable education and certified health coverage.
The substitute care must provide all the necessities that were missing in the homes they left.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The peculiarities of the Internet have given rise to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and satisfaction.
For example, some suggest that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Igmey and McCord (1998) defined "personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" as motivational phenomena in their analysis of audience interaction with websites.
The use of video recording has made important discoveries in the interpretation of micro/micro expressions and facial movements lasting a few fractions of a second.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether someone is lying by interpreting exact expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks argued in his research paper, entitled The President's Speech, that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are therefore able to accurately assess sincerity.
It suggests that these abilities to analyze human behavior may be shared by some animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: one conserved and one exhibited.
Mutation increases new genetic diversity, and selection isolates it from the species it formerly constituted.
Discrimination and reintegration change the diversity between two groups in each generation.
In savannah forests it is difficult for a monkey with the same digestive system as a human to meet its amino acid needs by eating the grasses that are there.
Failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death, he added.
The available protein sources are green and brown leaves, but these are difficult for a monkey species like us to digest to be cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digested, but are high in protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not be surprising that one of our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a manner similar to that of chimpanzees in the savanna.
The alarm clock strikes once a person is awake during their normal sleep period and then goes back to sleep after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a quiet alarm clock to keep you awake without waking you up.
If you find yourself falling asleep while checking your watch, you can put it on the back of your bed, which will require you to get out of bed to stop it.
Other possible biological choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, or any urine-conducting fluid) before falling asleep, to wake the person up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force. One has the capacity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everything can lead to enlightenment. The only thing holding us back on the path to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but expanded through the path of Mahayana love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
Kundalini Yoga is the practice of awakening kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) using yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the god Yuga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and a consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but by the end of the war, clashes of systems, procedures, and cultures had emerged as a conflict between the two nations.
The Allies and the Allies began a Cold War two years after the declaration of war.
It would last for the next 40 years and was fiercely fought by the armies of the Agency across the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defences collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman Bridge.
Well, this was a long-standing overnight plan, where more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts immediately after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Freight ships are the most efficient means of transporting large quantities of goods and people across oceans.
To serve the Navy was to ensure the movement of your country's people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
A prominent example is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic to aid the British.
At the same time, the German Navy was attempting to stem this traffic, primarily by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have invaded Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to be preserved as it became easier for them to obtain milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were reared in herds such as hedges or other grazing lands, often tended by shepherds who were often young farmers or adolescents, as was the widely known shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built by the English in the early 16th century.
Although the carts were only made of parallel wooden planks, they were able to be pulled by horses and achieved higher speeds and higher loads on what were considered difficult roads at the time.
Train poles were selected relatively early to stabilize the tracks, but over time a rail over the tracks made it more efficient.
This is not a common practice but the iron helps the wooden wheels to rust.
Eventually, wooden rails were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first complete railway was built.
The first means of transportation was by foot, and humans appeared to have walked on foot for two million years in Homo erectus (erect man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk as fast as they are supposed to.
Two-legged species were found in the fossil record of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 Ma, but coelacanths may have walked on two legs as recently as seven Ma.
We can live a life that is more environmentally friendly and we can join the environmental movement and we can be active in reducing some of the suffering of the future.
This is exactly the case with treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we want only a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem, or we have to contain it.
It is quite obvious that the world is changing dramatically due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and that problems are getting bigger due to the increase in population and the luxurious lifestyle of humans.
After Congress ratified it on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to the printer John Dunlap, who was only one mile away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed in the evening, which is now known as the Dunlap Nine.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Square on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July and read to his troops on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 surviving Dunlap Letters are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and still lives today. They call them birds.
Many people think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales or claws, lay eggs, or walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all the bases used today rely on the information game written in a two-digit system.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, depending on the computer language.
Symptoms of internal intoxication may not be present at the site. An immediate diagnosis cannot be based on the appearance of symptoms such as a general infection.
The best indicator of indoor toxicity may be an open container of toxic medication or household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
Entomologists use the term "herb" to refer to this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have been extensively adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and killer bugs are insectivorous, and they can adapt to living in their host's nest or home.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults.
Encephalitis is a disease that can affect the central nervous system which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or that of their child to raise a child.
This couple may choose to have their child born blind.
In the process of adoption, the adoptive parents lose their parental rights to choose a foster parent.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method guides scientific research.
However, they are not alone in this regard, as experimentation and testing can be used to disprove a hypothesis or even; asking questions and making observations are also aspects of scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted for all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself severed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
They also observed that rhythms in physiology and behavior are constantly being influenced by internal cycles and their production through the circadian clock.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simple responses to cyclic signals, are observed in most organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are oscillators that will continue for periods through successive cycles even in the absence of any external influences.
Hershey and Cheese's experiments were among the first to suggest that the DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses or bacteria to introduce their own DNA into the bacteria.
A pair of experiments were conducted to distinguish either viral DNA from phage using radioactive phosphorus or bacterial protein from radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different frequencies depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic component being measured and whether the cells involved are of the germ lineage.
The mutation expected in cells from a germ lineage is the one that can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism involves people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visit and photograph the orangutans of Borneo and learn about them.
People from small towns walk in their cars every morning to reach the places where they are served and meet others on the way back to the place from which they came.
In the biomechanics of transportation, each supports and is somehow connected to a transportation system whose basis is its own automobile.
Science now says that the large-scale economy of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is one of the stable conditions that have sustained humans for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transport system. Everyone complains about the transport system.
Such levels of complaints about water quality or leaking pipes are rarely heard in developed countries.
Why do transit systems cause so many problems, and why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers not efficient? Or is there something more to it?
Highway flow is the study of the movement of people and vehicles between two locations and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately , to study road safety is difficult because the behaviour of drivers is unpredictable.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; thus, traffic has a reasonable consistency, which can be expressed mathematically approximately.
To have a flow in the traffic, add these three things: 1 flow, 2 density, 3 and velocity.
These links help with planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can store their wings behind their backs.
This gives them many small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonfly and the Mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people argued that he was right and many argued the opposite; the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the stars for others).
That makes sense because the ground doesn't feel moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of about six miles .
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,378 kilometres (3,980 mi) long. It is joined by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramids were built with stone until the time of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or architectural excellence.
Ancient Egyptians in the modern state have been fascinated by the relics of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
With a population of about eight hundred and eighty-one, Vatican City is the smallest independent city in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City is Italian-speaking in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most of the people who work in the state, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Roman Catholics.
Basic chemicals such as gold, silver and copper have been known for a long time and can easily be recovered from nature in their original form by simple means.
The philosopher Aristotle held that everything was composed of a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was analogous to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumed that they were transforming into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold as well.
You can also cast a dielectric alloy from non-metallic materials such as carbon .
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the space between the paragraphs of this sentence.
Water is another example. Water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
Unfortunately, new writing methods have made it less valuable to use a pencil.
People who type messages on computer screens are elderly and need something to hold them up.
You can think of something I can send to my son to show him something new.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to combine nuclei with more deprotons and neutrons.
A type of metal that rolls a heavy cart up a hill. The splitting of the core releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have a single nucleus that is not fissile and that is constantly splitting whether by some shake or not.
A lunar surface containing rocks and dust. It is called the crust of the moon in Hebrew.
The thickness of the shell is about 70 kilometres on the near side and 100 kilometres on the far side.
It is weak under Maria and thick under the highlands.
I'll have Maria over here soon so the crust is thinner. It was easy to get up.
Content theories are about finding what excites or attracts people.
Many theories state that people have certain needs or desires that they acquire as they grow and mature.
These theories question what is unique about people who are allowed to do what they do and whether it is the same for those around them who are allowed to do it or not.
Two of the most well-known theories of content are Maslow's needs theory and Herteribisches workers' theory.
In general, two types of behavior may emerge when managers begin to lead their lagging peers: one is to try to remain "in the limelight" (or "in the limelight").
This type of manager has difficulty making unusual decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
Conversely, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must become the object of the group's management and especially remain its property.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
When dealing with various devices that prevent a person from accessing their identity, the first step to addressing the problem is to identify the root cause of the problem.
Usually, online team members act as a point of contact between themselves and the real-world team.
They often enjoy greater autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a "subtle group" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p109) is a distinctive component of the virtual group.
An "Invisible Team" is a management team to which members report. An "Invisible Team" defines the criteria for each member.
Why would an organization waste time creating an organizational learning system? Innovation is about applying organizational learning concepts.
To use resources in a way that is effective in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and efficiency are required.
As a result, collaboration within an organization can lead to overcoming obstacles and running innovative and novel processes that can meet customer needs.
Before an organization is able to innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) defines continuity as the process by which organizations collaborate to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. This narrows the field of research and makes it more precise.
The relationship between neurology and behaviorism supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental function.
The development of new technology has helped us to discover the structure and function of the brain that we have previously been unable to see.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
While AI is a strong argument for science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves trying to make machines that manage services that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Or as they do for discrete disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been found in many software applications and home video games.
Field trips are a big part of any semester. Often a university will send its students to places that can be reached by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view the museum artifacts, visit the aquarium or enjoy the fine arts while sitting in the department.
Sharing the territory of a virtual tour is a great way to think about the trip and share your experiences with the next departments.
For example, each year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capitol, and the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online for archival purposes.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Students often start their blogging experience with grammatical and spelling mistakes, but with the public, that all changes.
Since students are the audience that always criticizes the author of a blog, they are trying to develop their writing skills to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "allow students to have a greater knowledge of the world around them". There is a need to nurture public interest as students become more proficient and useful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool, and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can "allow students to be more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to online material, students can determine their own position on other writings and can also determine their own opinions on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada 's charming bilingual capital with many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada 's past and present .

Amazigh fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merini as a strategic base named Nava.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan conquistadors returned to the city and called it Casa Blanca, and Spanish traders named it Casablanca and established trading centers there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Throughout the old town, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as hams, pottery, leather, scissors and a whole range of jewelry, but these are only for tourists.

The currency of Falkland is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is close in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank in Algeria which is in Stanley on the way from the West FIC shop.
Pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and often Stanley cards and even US dollars are accepted.
The use of debit cards may no longer be possible in the outer islands, so British and US currency may be used; please pay in advance for a possible withdrawal.
It is almost impossible for the Falkland Islands currency to be treated like the islands' currency, as they must be treated like money before they can be considered an island.
Since Montevideo is in the south of the equator , summer is in the northern hemisphere and winter is in the northern hemisphere.
