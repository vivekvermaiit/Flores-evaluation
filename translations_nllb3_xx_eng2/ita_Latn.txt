Not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but it provides more detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish brown on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the lower part.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage lacks the basic structure of the tailbone, but has other features of feathers, beards, and barbels, the researchers concluded that the tailbone was likely the result of evolutionary development after these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that it was not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers speculate that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows adult feathers and not chickens' down.
The researchers hypothesize that although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage and not that of a chick.

The luminosity is used together with the rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the activity of the star relative to the magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for had to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in this galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pulling force on the Earth that generates tides, so the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same as those of "normal" matter.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is gathered in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the voter's identity has been verified by the officials, he deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988 the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are inserted other than those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
The candidates may send their representatives to assist at each stage of the process.

Her other race, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting group, with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Claudia Loesch of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's group failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police has managed to recover the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her cell phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was left with a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his own son.
She's being held pending trial and appeal, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish law has different parameters, with Scottish courts finding the publication of the photos potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspicious subjects are walking on a minefield".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the prosecution, has told reporters that no further comment will be made until at least the formal indictment.
According to leaked information, the document will deal with the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the experimental pest control program had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting programme, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of NPWS's Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety training and instruction.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth provisional electoral council in Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The committee was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The occasional violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 additional incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple's referral of the report "absolutely deplorable".
The Mariana earthquake was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage was reported in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In the Philippine capital of Manila, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza fired on the tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a physician.
After training as a midwife, she joined the staff of the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While on duty at the hospital, Liggins began to study cases of preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' of flight records on Wednesday.
Even his wrestling buddies wanted to pay their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman".
"Luna was as weird as I am... maybe even more so... and I love her and I'm gonna miss her... and hopefully she's in a better place", was Dustin "Goldust" Runnels' comment.
According to the poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of those surveyed, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In contrast, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but has been blamed for several disorders that have led to doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome the pain because they're banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to earth - the stuff that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and especially how the earth formed from long-ago collisions with comets.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He says speculation is nothing but "political chatter and idiocy".
He's been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the obsolete ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and no surface trains will stop at Wembley, and no car parks or interchange car parks are available on site.
Fears over the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
A new species of bird is believed to have been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
According to researchers at Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer; this was due to mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
They can be worked into any shape, and they can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a fine thread, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, and it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "miniature codes" because of the ability to be made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the juice of red cabbage it is possible to construct a pH indicator.
The juice of the cabbage changes color according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the test chemical is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, stick them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands and the outer layers will react to create a strange sensation and a shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water and a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewerage systems have been discovered.
Toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes included in public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or a telescope into space requires a rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world tremendously, and among the many benefits it has brought us, the most important is that it has provided us with easier and faster transportation.
His invention gave birth to the train, the automobile, and various other means of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on smaller prey, which are considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a particular goal that each cat has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called packs.
The flocks are made up of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and young that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to one another, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion herd acts much like the wolf or dog herd, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), even as regards deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: The tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, make very long jumps, and exert a traction force five times that of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same family (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it is more like a phrase of shouted, angry words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent, sniffing out where they have been.
Night vision allows them to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots blend in with their surroundings and then swoop down on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will likely find itself in a different environment from the one in which it was before.
This new environment is characterised by different resources and competitors, so to establish itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those previously required.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans expel (through exhalation).
Plants process their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, much of the food we eat is made from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of its era and for that reason it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws bore more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row on the palate, so that anyone who crossed its path had no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that it was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with it.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also featured several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a species of rodent called the ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed feasting together by lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Occasionally, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Because of the mild climate of the Middle East, the house was not of primary importance.
Much of the Jewish family life was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while shops were simple open-air stalls facing the street.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, so the wood was especially expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red named it after his encounter with Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all of them were "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
However, this is false, and even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, probably, the annotation was just put on as a label.
The D-Day landings and ensuing fighting had brought northern France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those Frenchmen who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were moving toward Germany.
By civilization is meant a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people living and working collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, which means civil; the term is in turn connected with civis, or citizen, and civitas, or city or city-state, and in some way therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means to transmit knowledge across several generations, to leave an indelible cultural imprint through an equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and thus are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was the only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, in the absence of a national executive or judicial branch, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and interstate duties.
Amending the articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, which for their part had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are more prevalent in the northern regions and see Italians committed to competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", given the presence of island groups that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through the island soon recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces; in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today, and more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (for example the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this point in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had served as a glue between the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power has affected everyone from kings to common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money reserves exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has caused many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy has proven effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating the international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in the previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different time periods were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division among provinces. The most famous was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these times, fierce wars broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since the army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this earthly life, and he used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's not really easy to find, even if you knew it existed, because once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the world around you.
Of the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one to have survived intact.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The major pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The 'upward-arched' indication shall resemble a V and the 'downward-arched' indication shall resemble a staple or a square without a lower side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the rack (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An ascending bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow results in a louder, more distinctive sound.
You may decide to add your own customized markings to the pencil, but keep in mind that the archery markings you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa aged 11 and Louis Charles aged 4) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover much of the cost, and the interest on the bonds was floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly the enormous gains from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events unfolded is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ends by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that the destiny of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, customs and culture have arisen related to this geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Similar to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a hub of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century its prestige declined, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The height of the Gothic style was reached in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of the communication channels means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the period, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is defined as farming that is carried on for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of an organic type, using preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of the harvest.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild, some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma prior to abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is raised entirely by nonhuman animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of it, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning is supposed to make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is an example of a scaffolding, but so is the little graffiti-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, solicit and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse, even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that doesn't provide them with nutrition, care and education, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster home is supposed to provide for all the unmet needs in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people who are unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even argues that such abilities to interpret human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences - stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In view of all this, it should not be surprising that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the period of normal sleep, followed by a resumption of sleep (1060 minutes later).
This process can be easily implemented using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset your watch in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm involve the consumption of many liquids before sleep (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace that is in direct proportion to the tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force there is, and each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the Mahayana love path and various Indian yoga techniques.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the centerpiece of Tibetan meditation, where the depiction of various deities cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras, and develops the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken through; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were soon proven obsolete, however, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using cargo ships is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's mission has always been to ensure that the country can safeguard its ability to move people and goods, while countering the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent and most notable examples of this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, in which the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic to support Britain.
At the same time the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They were domesticated by ancient cultures and tribes for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually raised in free-roaming herds on hillsides or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply parallel wooden planks, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses traveling on them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossbars were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first means of transport that man knew were the legs. Humans began to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk erect.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate some of the future suffering, we can start to adopt more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even become activists.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment, but if we want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a great deal because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, while problems have increased because of overpopulation and extravagant life-styles of humans.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, now known as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known Dunlap edges are the oldest extant copies of the document.
According to many paleontologists today, one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and they are the ones we call birds.
Many people tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many features in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T. rex, they have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but its symptoms, including vomiting, are so general that it is impossible to diagnose immediately.
The main indication of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals in the home.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both killer and bed bugs are nest- dwellers, that is, they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, MS has about 400,000 known cases, making it the number one neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop MS as males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or in their child's.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method, and this method actually guides most of the scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations helps to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behaviour are strongly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, which are viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the cells involved belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be passed on to offspring are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is the practice of attracting people to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities to be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of information concerning the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns to drive to work, crossing paths with others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic of commuting, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which they also support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transportation systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaint about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why do they fail every day, are the engineers who design them incompetent, or is there a deeper motivation?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable constancy and can be represented generically in a mathematical way.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables have been correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to learn to fly, and their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
To some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying eight times the amount of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on earth, reaching six miles wide in some places.
Twenty percent of the total water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and thousands of smaller tributaries flow into it.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of grandeur and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, which were by then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the State, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These actually more closely resemble the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals, and keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minute amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Since its invention, the pencil has thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and to less and less widespread use.
Now everyone writes their messages on computer screens and never has to go near a temperamatite.
We can only wonder what fate will befall the keyboard when something new arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission bomb.
So, if you split the nucleus further, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break apart under little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick at its nearest side and 100 kilometers thick at its farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which has facilitated the upwelling of lava to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and what drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, when managers start managing their former colleagues, two behaviours can emerge: on the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate performance, to define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the whole team's operation and do it himself.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often creates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with a few minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings may take place in different time zones, which may not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member refers and which sets the standards for each member.
The first is that the learning process is not a one-way process, but a process of learning and learning is a process of learning and learning.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological findings have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, the area of research is becoming narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior is at the heart of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and cancer can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never observed before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite its strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of applications are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Tours are a fundamental part of teaching, and teachers often want to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution is technology with virtual tours, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great way to share travel experiences and thoughts with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills, as their first experiences with blogging are often marked by poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author is committed to improving his writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them".The need to feed the interest of the public motivates students to be inventive and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's picturesque, bilingual capital, with its art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, the natural, unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and more.
All of this and more makes Ontario uniquely Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, among these some are almost uninhabited wildlands.
If you compare the population, the result may surprise many: In the United States, there are more African-American citizens than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxury beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which made a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which runs from Europe to India, by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
For female travellers: it is recommended that all women declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realise that cultural differences can give rise to what they themselves consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and don't be afraid to oppose (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a strategically important port used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city which he called Daru l-Badya, later called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their trading bases.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookah and a lot of trinkets, but all this is reserved for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to do some research before making any visits outside Goma, in order to assess the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the climb to Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
A boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a consequence of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up becoming a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decayed city, but its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World", it was one of the main stages.
With its more Arabian than African flair, the city stands out clearly from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to the border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
Covering an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily fees are charged for conservation and entry to the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card may also be useful, as it gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a sparkling bar chart, made all the more evident by its setting by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on the heavily populated reclaimed land of the northern coast.
This is the place that the British settlers chose for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of this land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal strip of mangrove globally, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into inland Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They also contain the remnants of the huge jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, with an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses that run between different districts are often full, it is good to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable, sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast means of reaching nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trusses are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two 3.50-meter wide lanes.
The bridge has a free vertical space of 15 metres underneath it. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
By September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge is expected to be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, semi-nomadic hunters and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley often accepts credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so you exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold - temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature below the thermometer reading.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem - bison, moose, deer, bear - virtually any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a proper distance, and it is necessary to leave adequate space for these animals, as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing along or cooking foods with strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of the infamous naval standoff of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is situated between two harbours, the most popular of which are divided into three areas.
The Pacific Ocean-facing beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mostly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide range of shops, and safe for swimming.
The most popular local beer is a simple, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have a lot of French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might be better for the trip.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the flat white coffee is a foreign idea, with espresso being the short black coffee, cappuccino being the cream (not the foam) and tea being served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with the Belgian, the fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many excursions are made to the reef year round, and accidents from such causes are rare on the reef.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cube jellyfish appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans, most of whom fear them and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles is primarily the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, and they do not live actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often make arrangements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants choose to camp on site, considering this a crucial element of the experience.
To be near the center of the action, you must arrive early and earn a spot near the music.
Remember that after the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are most exposed.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time to explore the city, and cruise passengers are granted visa exemption (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything possible to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests' spirits up and keep them occupied.
In some places alcoholic beverages are provided by the house, but intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of remaining sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or near-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as one would on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that you get stuck.
Rain and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the focal point of many visitors' vacations.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to trips made overland, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is all that is needed to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful, and that is why they are best observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari, or walking safari) is a hike that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, the first of which was held in 1964.
If your 2020 flight and accommodation booking was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary among them, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, as of late March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Stretching wet clothes can make them easier to dry. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and an ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear socks with a stretcher, you may try a hair dryer, if available.
Care should be taken not to subject the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways of treating water, and some of these have been found to be more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it takes many minutes.
Filter efficiency varies, so if in doubt, consider buying water packaged in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests that are not common in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infection.
The very infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people are not usually qualified as pests.
Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on such products as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas among vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes peeled, as steep slopes, narrow roads, and tight curves are common.
The speed limits shown are significantly lower than those applied on the preceding and following sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h).
Strangely, though, the mobile phone service in this area is much higher than in other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those in neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are timeless classics, from those with apples available year-round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but tasty desserts can turn to those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices mixed with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used for curries in inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a number of simple preparation dishes; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially in England, were fitted with safety bars, which cause a leather brace to detach from the saddle when the rider pulls it back in case of a fall.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are topped.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world continually trace new routes on its walls, potentially endless.
Freediving sports such as skiing and snowboarding are very popular and involve sliding on snow using skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums", who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first rock paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians in 1861.
Skiing: The activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is related, though usually not included, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a similar route to the hiking trail.
If conditions are good, you may cover somewhat greater distances than those traveled on foot, but you will only very rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it is made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through several countries, you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to pass through passport control again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus saving time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique, and some tax agencies consider an object to be at least 100 years old.
The definition differs geographically from the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antiques, even if more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some made a living from fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Today many Sámi people are engaged in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi territory.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a wrong perception of Roma people.
If a traveller's warning is issued for the destination you are visiting, there could be consequences for your travel health insurance or your insurance in the event of a cancellation of the trip.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are directed to the citizens of those governments.
To give an example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
'Adverse weather conditions' is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon which may cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of extreme weather, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind gusts, hail, above-normal rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea thunderstorms and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include thunderstorms, blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered as a war zone must undergo vocational training.
A search on the Internet for 'Hostile environments course' will likely find the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The intention of governments to issue passports with no gender (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents is equally variable.
Security screenings have also become much more scrupulous in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in the preoperative stage should not expect to pass the screening without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Backflow currents are formed by the backflow of waves that break on the beach, often near a reef or similar formations.
Given the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths are due to fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
Once you're out of the current, getting back in the water won't be any harder than it used to be.
Try to identify an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
Re-entry shock occurs in a shorter time than culture shock (there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have difficulty adjusting to the culture of their home country.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the customs of your home culture.
On your first experience abroad, you likely met people who were patient and understanding, aware that travelers to a new country need to adjust.
Many people did not realize that patience and awareness were also needed for those returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the show begins, you will be able to admire the pyramids in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors, the sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula, with King George Island being the largest and home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, the latter of which is the caldera of a still-active volcano that has filled with water to form a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea at Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 200-mile (360 km) chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m (15,920 ft) with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only viable alternative.
A satellite phone is not generally a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure boats, including pleasure craft, as well as missions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among recent graduates, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during the gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education on return to one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing.The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in its lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht to go to the islands and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is rather unusual (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a stay of several days in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa will not be required for landing (from 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of - it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people have toward other things.
For some people, a little understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or the feeling of not being in control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly, and often timeliness is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would take days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as hold baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger.
To fly first class or business class the most obvious way is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do so).
However, the price is high: for example, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business travel and up to eleven times the fare for first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first- or business-class seats.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a class of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and they apply certain fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation crossroads.
The ancient city of Smyrna is situated on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains, and is now a modern, developed, and active commercial center.
Although the city has a Mediterranean-European feel rather than a traditional Turkish one, the wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik, you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
In the church's sanctuary, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the enchanting village.
To the north lies the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible, and made famous to foreigners by Lord Byron's brilliant account of its splendor.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops in Cabo da Roca.
To the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of Marian apparitions that are famous throughout the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and it has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or forced to work to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, and avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by smearing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known to practically everyone.
However, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used in public transport and other services.
In the metro, the regular announcements are only in Catalan, and any unplanned service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automated system.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and conceited.
Although often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel at home in Paris is still to behave as well as possible, to relate as a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person, which will make your travels much easier.
The rough exterior of Parisians will quickly fade if you display some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly beech, beech and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels it has a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a great variety of animal and bird species.
These places are home to rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the rooster, along with several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and to cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stole for women who come unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it's brightly colored, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that reach below the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the entrance store; however, the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, except the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "She", always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and adjectives.
This probably also makes reading easier, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantiated form makes writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure that you pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means beloved, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
So, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimum knowledge of Spanish may jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now generally obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossom was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants do their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" a specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting a few plants will cost you the trip away from this place, no question.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with heat (always) and strong sunshine (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the inner Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme to plan a vacation around.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of well-known hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians around the world.
One tradition involves spending the night of Easter awake in an open place to watch the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual connected with spring and fertility.
In more traditional Churches an Easter vigil is frequently celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the considerable distance from the mainland, the mammals could not make the journey, and this led to the giant tortoise becoming the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you may experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark for most of the day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, and you can even enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
Office clothing is normally a jacket and tie or a suit and colleagues are addressed by their surname or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, as it emphasizes the commitment of the group rather than individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their superiors' approval for every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without question.
