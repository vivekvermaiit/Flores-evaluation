Not only does this confirm the already widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, but it also provides details about what fossils generally could not have been, including color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur was chestnut-brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
The find also provides a detailed look at the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed skeleton called a rachis, but have other features of the feathers  spines and rays , scientists have concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather to regulate temperature or for courtship.
Although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the scientists believe that the feathers in the sample are those of an adult, not a baby's.

The work they did was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The phenomenon the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides to rise and fall, so the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have found that the interaction of one dark matter with another is the same as that of ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is contained in a glowing halo of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered an extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some of the patients may have been infected at the hospital, and at least two of them were health care workers.

Infrared images have captured temperature changes at night and during the day, proving that this is likely a cave.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team, also at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech, with voters going into a separate area and putting a pre-printed piece of paper with their candidate's name in an envelope.
Once the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter will place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voting list.
The French electoral law has a fairly strict codification of procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those carried by duly certified and counted voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the whole process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision in accordance with specific procedures.

UN peacekeepers who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake have been blamed for spreading the disease that broke out near a military base.
The suit alleges that the waste from the UN camp was not properly disinfected, and as a result, the bacteria were introduced into the Artibonite River, one of the largest rivers in Haiti.

Adekoya was then charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of his son.
She's in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, however any eyewitness evidence may be wasted as her likeness has been published on a large scale.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and the courts consider the publication of the photographs to be potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee claims that 'journalists are taking a dangerous course when they publish photos of suspicious people.'
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for criminal prosecution, has indicated to reporters that it will not comment further on the case until at least charges have been brought.
The document is allegedly related to a border dispute that Palestine is seeking based on the state of the borders before the 1967 Six Day War.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations hold sacred, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is required to maintain a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, while Palestine agrees to maintain such a presence for a period of five years only.
The shooters in the supplementary pest test had to be under the strict supervision of the foresters, because the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage parks at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday inaugurated a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the pre-arranged resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes, violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires, with four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the facilities.
Last week, the government agency METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The Ministry of Finance responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report 'really regrettable'.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m.
The Office of Emergency Situations for the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there is no indication that a tsunami is coming.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he abducted a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Along with the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and elderly persons, were also released early.
Then the photographers took over the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, known as "black boxes", on Wednesday.
The warrior comrades also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first extreme queen. She was my first manager. She died in the night two months ago, which was quite original as she was. She was a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented, "The Moon was as crazy as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and I will miss her...I hope she's doing well up there".
Of the 1,400 people who took part in the poll ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, the interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard communicated her belief that Australia should become a republic after the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of respondents share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
At the extreme of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints raised doubts about his fitness.
He couldn't take the medication needed to overcome the pain because it's forbidden at the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known.
Several people had confirmed the invention using other hardware and software by early February, with this being announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supplies to Earth, along with organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called gossip "political chatter and folly".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says allows planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately identify the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no alternative transport, no overhead trains stop at Wembley, and no car parks or park-and-ride facilities.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study that reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species has evolved in two generations - though it was believed that the process would take much longer - by crossing the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, with the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into many shapes, such as rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided, beaten and twisted into boards.
It can be made very thin and it can be glued to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-made pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called a pH chemical, and the indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes color according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons taken away (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands will begin to react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange sensation and the formation of a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost every home.
Remnants of a sewage system have been found in the homes of Greek Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were commonplace, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women mingled together in mixed society.
To talk to someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, which is then reflected back down to Earth almost immediately.
A rocket launched a satellite into space, and scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and visual field.
To get a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a huge rocket, over 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing it has brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
This has given us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized cat-like predators that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much larger small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific area or task that each of the beasts is responsible for, which prevents competition.
Lions are the most social of the cat-like predators, living in large groups called packs.
The flock consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave similarly to wolf packs or to packs of dogs, which behave surprisingly like lions (but not like other feline predators).
As a well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump for long distances, and pull five times as hard as a powerful man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar with a mighty voice but, rather, like a few harsh words shouted.
Ocelots are big eaters of small animals, occasionally catching monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, but the vast majority of the animals they hunt are considerably smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and search for animals to eat (benefit) by the smell and sniff of the places they have been.
They have excellent night vision and also move very discreetly, hunting their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they originate (such as when they move across a mountain or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily get back), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the original one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be strong competitors than they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they become less and less like members of other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
The name of this process is speciation, which means just the development of new species, and speciation is an unconditional result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We use plants to build our homes, to make our clothes, and most of what we consume comes from plants, and animals couldn't survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the highest ranking predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were set with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of claws, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, it may have fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
It also attacked everything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't match it.
While many of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual dishes at banquets, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a plch.
Another difference is that poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, whereas rich men preferred communal feasts, at which they ate while lazing on their sides.
Ancient Roman cuisine certainly could not have included ingredients that did not reach Europe from the Americas or Asia until centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
The people used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes temples included specially built pyramidal towers called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
The house was not so substantial in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of the life of an ordinary Hebrew family was spent under the open sky.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just shelves facing the street, and houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was devoid of extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found a new land and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history.
If you've seen the movie, The Templar Treasure Hunt, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
Although the document has a title on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, and the text is found in the lower part of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days a large parchment document (about 25 by 20 inches [75 by 27 cm] in size) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the record was used only to identify the document.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the "Vichy French", the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated the south of France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant number of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and this word is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and this also in some ways defines the size of society.
City states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture entails the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the continuation of a cultural footprint and the uniform expansion.
Smaller cultures often die out without leaving relevant historical evidence and therefore cannot be recognised as true civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, whose only component was Congress.
Congress had no power to tax, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress relied on the state to enforce all its laws, but they often failed to cooperate.
Nor did it have any authority to rewrite laws on taxation and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, along with the national football team from Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international events and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the grouping of islands that Japan has, from a geographical point of view, Japan is often considered to be an 'island archipelago'
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing around recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company builds a base in southwestern Taiwan, begins transforming native grain cultivation practices, and employs Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894  1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three basic structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1975, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most commonly used format for photographs worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited from the image sensors of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35 mm format has a surprising width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format, divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers, is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS group of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
Very often used, but also ridiculed, is the simple rule of thirds, which creates dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
He argues that the most effective place for the main subject is on the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny, becoming rich and powerful.
For more than a millennium, Christianity has held European countries together despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used for these purposes.
The church had been present as the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether its principles were being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, as it has succeeded in disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that the blockade violates generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain conditioned international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since there was only a minimal response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations.
After the world saw the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations desired to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with a nickel, a book of poetry, and a letter from his former manager, Charles Batchelor, who had recommended him to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each historical period of China or each family in power was a dynasty that made a significant mark on history.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of these being the Three Kingdoms period, which existed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, a bitter war raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, and thousands of people died in battles for supremacy in the great palace of Sian.
Many social and political phenomena are explored, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for the military, because instead of rank being based on class, they've gone to caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond earthly life, often going to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira, on Mount Noor (Light).
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Lying atop one of the hills north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to get into it, even if you know where it is, because once you're in a cave, you're completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but a clear, beautiful sky and a multitude of surrounding mountains, and very little of this world is seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, is located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead. It is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The 'push up' mark looks like a V and the 'push down' mark looks like a buckle or square without a bottom.
Top means you should start from the tip and press the bar, while bottom means you should start from the frog (the place where you hold the bar with your hand) and pull the bar.
The top of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the bottom of the bow is firmer and more durable.
You can write down your own tracks, but remember that the printed notes are there for musical reasons, so you should usually keep them.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of revellers drove frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, from Versailles back to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a chariot, accompanied by an angry mob of screaming people who threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a royal guard that had been beheaded at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to pay for the bulk of the expenses and the interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government was channeled through the banking houses on Wall Street.
It is clear that the enormous profits made from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people have been the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order was founded.
The period when these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the epoch of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is generally dated to around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of notions from the development of new technologies or the technological imperative to its narrow meaning that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself goes a way that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology "influences" societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership is also leading to higher rates of road accidents, which is leading to new medical techniques for healing injured bodies.
An important element of Romanticism was cultural determinism, drawing from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography-related customs and culture emerged that were consistent with society and were better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is now considered the fashion capital of Europe, Constantinople was during the feudal period.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began sometime around 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned and brought gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what was offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Early clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of the time, brought by the Crusades, was the button, which was used to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture carried out for the purpose of producing the quantity of food needed exclusively for the subsistence of the farmer and his family.
Self-supply farming is a simple, often organic system that uses self-sown seed  originating from an ecoregion  in combination with a sowing process or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterised by age, ethnic origin, social class, geographical location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through the expressive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization draws on several unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unhappy, or intentionally abused and not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some unruly children have been restrained by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the parents have abandoned the child because they could not cope with his or her significant intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a feral child is raised by animals other than human beings, the behavior (within physical limits) is almost the same as that of a particular animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the 'scaffolding' strategy goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a tool to help people who encounter new experiences in learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The solutions can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is also a form of solution, but so is the little office clutch in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scavenging is internalised in the software, and is primarily designed to challenge and explain procedures that are too difficult for the student to do on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and instructive, yet it does.
We feel that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is intended to provide the children with everything they need that was missing in the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in the use and satisfaction theory.
For example, it is assumed that 'learning' and 'socialization' are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
In researching audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified personal engagement and persistent relationships as motivating aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
More specifically, it is claimed that a correct interpretation of micro-events can reveal whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, showed that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately judge the sincerity of speech.
It even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may share such abilities in interpreting human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the group of variations that have been expressed.
Segregation and recombination blend variations between the two groups with each generation.
On the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans has difficulty meeting its need to obtain amino acids from available plant sources.
Failure to do so will have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant sources were probably the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, egg) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep time and then falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
You can do this simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
But if you put off the alarm while you sleep, you can move it to the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), which will make a person get up and go to the bathroom.
The degree of inner peace that a person has is directly related to the tension in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive life force, and every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that's holding us back is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it spread through the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in its essence, and it involves Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the energy of kundalini (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yogic postures, aerobic exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, where the visualization of various deities cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and creates a consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the U.S.A. When the war ended, these two allies were divided by the very confluence of systems, processes and culture.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last another 40 years, and it was really fought for through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defensive wall had been broken and the only hope for it was a retreat and rearrangement along the Romanian perimeter.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union violated the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, and entered the eastern regions of Poland, thus forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of the navy was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move people and goods, while preventing your enemy from moving people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
And at the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop these movements, mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and were often herded by goatherds, often children or adolescents, similar to the common shepherd.
In England, railways were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the draught horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The rails were introduced early to hold the rails in place, but it was later found that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron belt on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused greater wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and the first all-iron railway was built in 1767.
The first known transport is walking, and humans started walking upright about two million years ago, when Homo erectus evolved.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Two-legged specialisations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be more environmentally conscious, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
As in many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment, but if we want a temporary solution, we should get to the root of the problem and we should eliminate it.
Clearly, mankind's scientific and technological advances have changed the world greatly, and overcrowding and extravagant lifestyles are making matters worse.
After passing through Congress on July 4, a handwritten bill signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made over the course of one night, and are now known as the "Dunlap Side Pages".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon and took place on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read by him to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
Twenty-five of Dunlap's side pages still exist and are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today hold the view that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to in computer jargon as binary digits or bits.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, as symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow an immediate diagnosis.
The quickest sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household cleaning chemicals.
Look for the label for the first aid instructions for this particular poisoning.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists for this group of insects in the formal sense of the word.
The name comes from the old knowledge of the bed bug, which is an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the larvae and the beetles are non-migratory, adapted to live in the nest or on their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the leading neurological diseases in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to make a so-called adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can take over the care of the child.
The main goal of science is to use scientific methods to find out how the world works, and these methods actually drive most of the scientific research.
But it's not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific findings, including those in the field of psychology, were accepted.
The West gradually found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as knowledge of Greek declined.
Many observed physiological and behavioral rhythms often critically depend on the presence of internal cycles and their formation through the biological clock.
In most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, regular rhythms are documented that are not just a response to external repeating signals.
The biological clock is an independent oscillator that will continue in a free-running cycle even in the absence of stimuli from the exergy environment.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was among the main indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on their type, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells are affected by germ cells.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
Examples include sightseeing, photography, and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns for work, and others pass by to work where the first ones left.
In this shuttle transportation, everyone is somehow tied to and supports a transportation system based on private automobiles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has supplanted the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human development for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed lands, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail every day, are they just incompetent transportation engineers, or is there something more fundamental?
The traffic flow is the result of observing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and observing their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is challenging because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, and therefore traffic flows, which can be roughly represented mathematically, often behave consistently.
For a clearer representation of the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of terrestrial communications.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along their body.
This gives them a greater choice of small places to hide from predators.
Now, there's only one insect that can't fold its wings, and that's dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size or technical perfection.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the relics of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest sovereign state in the world with the lowest population.
In the Vatican, Italian is used for official communication and legislation.
Italian is also used daily by the majority of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times because they are all found in nature in their natural form and can be mined relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It looked like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, yet he thought they changed into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
They're alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
When the pencil was introduced, it became a good friend to many people.
However, as newer writing methods emerged, the pencil was sidelined and used less and less.
People now leave links on their computer screens and never have to go near the grinder.
You can just think about what happens to the keyboard when something new comes out.
The fission bomb uses the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with a number of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy truck up a hill, and then when you split the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they are prone to decay with little or no shock.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the inverted side and 100 km on the inverted side.
It's thinner under the sheets and thicker under the top.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner, so the lava could more easily reach the surface.
Content theories are about finding out what drives people to behave the way they do or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become their own as adults.
These theories focus on what motivates people to want to do certain things and what in their environment compels them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour that can occur when managers start leading their previous peers.At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain in the position of 'one of the party' (or buddies).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, determining responsibility, and even with responsibility to people.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual is transformed into an unrecognizable individual with the feeling that he has to change everything that the team has done and do it his way.
The manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the whole team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual and traditional teams follow the same quality standards, but with slight differences.
The members of the virtual team mostly serve as a contact point for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can meet according to changing time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique feature of a virtual team is also the presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member is subject.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently across the executive departments of the organization, the door opens to creativity and ingenuity.
The process of working together in an organisation to overcome an obstacle can then lead to a new innovative process that helps to meet customer needs.
An organisation can be innovative, but first management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning.
The film Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations aim to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes like never before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
AI has a strong science fiction connotation and forms a major branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of robots.
AI research involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Cases include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to life's problems.
Artificial intelligence is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into several applications in home computers and video game software.
Excursions are an important part of the life of every class, and the teacher would often like to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual excursions, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in a classroom with their classmates.
A great way to think about a trip and share experiences with other classes is to share the excursion in a virtual way.
For example, every year, students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online to serve as a journal.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, and while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In blogging, students are forced to become more world-oriented.The need to satisfy the audience's interest thus inspires students to become more skilled and to pursue their own interests (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs allows students to deepen their analytical and critical thinking; through active response to online materials, students can define their own positions in the context of others' files and outline their own views on specific problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming 'bilingual' capital, offering visitors a wealth of art galleries and museums that represent its past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of the Muskoka region.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what foreigners consider to be essentially Canadian.
Large areas farther north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: There are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have ties with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries and in the Comoros and Mayotte it was received in a big way.
The period of European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travellers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but only one that does not look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would normally consider harassment.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to hold your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and, under the name Anfa, served as a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Bayda, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts in the city gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places around the old medina selling traditional Moroccan products such as taginis, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a variety of geegaws, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially its downtown.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, before you travel outside Goma, you should do some research to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo and one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
To travel around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
'Timbuktu' has come to be used as a metaphor for relatively inaccessible, exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken city, though it has a reputation as a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stops during his special program, The Strange Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country, as its appearance is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) in northeastern South Africa extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the KrokodÃ­lia River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Here too, park maintenance and entrance fees are paid as in all South African national parks.
The most advantageous way may be to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a select number of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
The whole area is called Hong Kong after the island of Hong Kong, and it is a place that is the main focus of interest for many tourists.
The set of buildings that outline Hong Kong might be compared to the glowing column chart seen from Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best view of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head for the coast opposite Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the site that the British colonizers claimed, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarban is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian interior.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is designated as the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests include not only the mangrove swamps but also some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Basin.
Sundarban covers an area of 3 850 km2, about one third of which is water/wetland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been the kingdom of the wild, and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers and some 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and sturdy Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby towns such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the entire Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 273 feet [83 m], are 1,292 feet [378 m] long, and have two 12-foot [3.50 m] wide lanes.
The vertical light height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was put into operation only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs inspection opinions should be completed.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most important indigenous group in the area of present-day eastern Paraguay, semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the GuaycurÃº and PayaguÃ¡, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in the Las CaÃ±itas area.
Smaller tournaments and matches are held here at other times of the year.
Information on tournaments and the possibility of purchasing tickets for polo matches can be found on the website of the AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards in remote islands are unlikely to be accepted, although both British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands' currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures are commonly above +30Â°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special 'rainy' and 'dry' periods: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, the wild beast remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they appear, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can strike.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they need to be given space.
Also, be aware that the scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of the infamous naval misunderstanding of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the US and the UK refused to leave the harbour
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering of people in the city led to the assassination of Tupua supreme chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
Bounded by two harbours, Auckland has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore (in North Harbor County) stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south, and is located on the Pacific Ocean.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded beaches for families with plenty of shops lining the coast.
The main local beer is Number One, not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more readily available.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are concerned, getting bottled water is not a problem.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign. Small black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino is served with a high layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef take place year-round, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the competent authorities, pay attention to the instructions on the labels and pay particular attention to the safety warnings.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the city, and occasionally outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live primarily in the ocean, their normal habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead of time gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with specific hotels, but they also offer the possibility of booking other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any suggestions for changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
As regards some festivals, the vast majority of visitors to music festivals choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get camping close to the music.
Remember that even when the music ends on the main stages, some parts of the festival may have music playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of your hut, as crossing the ice makes a rather awful noise to those who are most affected.
The cruises in St. Petersburg include a stay in the city.
Casinos usually try very hard to keep guests occupied and spend as much money as possible, and most lack windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have unique offerings of food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and to make them stay as long as possible.
Since drunkenness impairs judgment, all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is minimal, and you cannot drive as if you were on a clear asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you could get stuck in it.
Reduced visibility may be caused by snow falling or blown, water condensing on windows or ice forming on vehicle windows.
In contrast, in many lands ice and snow are common, and traffic runs almost continuously throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a great experience for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a journey by land to explore the magnificent African wilderness, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they are better seen from a distance with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking or hiking safari or just walking) is a tourist activity of several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may have gotten into an uncomfortable situation.
Cancellation conditions vary, but at the end of March, most cancellation conditions that originate in the coronavirus do not exceed July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the price of a standard ticket being about 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps dry wet clothes, and even when they are not in the room, many hotels have an iron and an ironing board for borrowing.
If an iron is not available or if you do not like to iron socks, you may try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to make the substance too hot (this can cause it to shrink and, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for just one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filter efficiency varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests that are not present in their home regions.
Pests can degrade food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or violently kill humans do not normally qualify as pests.
Purchasing in duty free zones allows goods to be purchased free of ordinary and excise duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging driving section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: they are full of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than on the preceding and following sections - generally 56-64 km/h  and strict adherence to them is more important than ever.
Surprisingly, the cell phone service here is much stronger than on many other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German confectionery is quite good, and in Bavaria it is quite colorful and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cake is common, with apples usually baked into the cake all year round, while cherries and plums usually appear over the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts, and the popular pies are often combined with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but plentiful bun, try the stuffed doughnut, which is called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
We know curry as "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid used.
In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that you can find across the country.
When used without further qualification, the term tends to denote a food originally from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, contains a number of easily flavored dishes. The predominant seasonings that Javanese people enjoy include peanuts, chilies, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The steepness is the support for the rider's legs, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can also pose a safety risk as they can potentially trap the rider's legs.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but has his foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes.
Most riders wear riding boots with heels and a fairly narrow, smooth sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety bars that allow the saddle to fall off the saddle if the falling rider pulls it back.
The Cochamo Valley is a popular mountaineering destination in Chile, and for its varied, huge granite walls and rock overhangs, it is referred to as the Yosemite of South America.
The views from the tops of the shields are breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes between the walls' endless potential.
Popular downhill winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski fanatics", who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a given location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Cross-country skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norse opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backpacking, ski mountaineering, or ski tourism.
It is related to (but usually does not include) alpine skiing and mountaineering, which is practiced on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and footwear.
Consider the ski route as a similar tourist route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover a little more distance than if you were walking  but you will rarely reach the speed you would if you were running without a heavy backpack on a paved track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is home to many independent states.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to repeatedly apply for visas and pass passport checks.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to a certain extent as one country.
If you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through the passport control posts again.
Also, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen area member countries separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique.Some tax authorities define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.
Detention conditions vary across the world, and this age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products may be classified as antiques despite being younger than a similar mass-produced product.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life for the Sami, and the culture of trade is also important for many other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in reindeer husbandry in large numbers, but they also subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people are involved in modern crafts.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive for its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are about to visit is the subject of a travel advice, this may affect your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
In addition to your own government, you may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The briefing report provides only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
Often, the opinions expressed are trivial, general, and oversimplified in comparison with more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, cause serious social disruption or result in loss of human life.
Adverse weather and its variations, which depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions, can occur anywhere in the world.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of adverse weather such as storms, tornadoes, water storms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to consider any risks that may arise from adverse weather in their area, which could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should attend a training course.
Just search the Internet for 'hostile environment courses' and you will probably get the address of a local business.
The course covers all the issues discussed in much more detail, along with practical experience.
The duration of the course is usually 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid instruction and sometimes perhaps weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure that they have valid documents with them for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired currency and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as well.
In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, security checkpoints also became much more intrusive.
Transgender people should not expect to pass through the scans before surgery without invasion of privacy and dignity.
Back currents are the returning fallout from waves breaking on a beach, often at a reef or similar.
Thanks to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in several deeper sections, where fast currents can form up to deep water.
For most deaths, exhaustion can be experienced by swimming backwards against the current, which may be quite impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether someone's registered you, you could try waiting for rescue.
The return shock occurs more quickly than the culture shock (the initial idyll phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who have easily adjusted to a new culture, adjusting back to their original culture can be especially challenging.
After returning home from a stay abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your customs from the home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not anticipate that passengers returning home need patience and understanding.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children to do in this area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the talk of tourists and vendors, and the story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is displayed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The pyramids are depicted with different scenes and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, of which sixteen are still active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King Juraj Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano forms a beautiful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area located in the southern part of the peninsula and is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula join here to form the high plateau and then re-emerge to form the 200-mile chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Mountains contains Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak, Mount Vinson, reaching an elevation of 4,892 m (12,920 ft).
Satellite phone may be your only option in remote places where there is no cell phone coverage.
A satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone in general, and to make a call with it, you must be outside in a place with a clear view of the satellite.
This service is often used in shipping, including cruise ships, as well as on voyages requiring long-distance data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap-year holiday, travel and learning is an increasingly popular option.
It is especially popular among recent graduates, as it offers them the opportunity to take a gap year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, attending a foreign exchange course can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education in your own country.
Registration for these training programmes usually requires payment of a tuition fee.
Finland is a great place for boating. The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in lakes and on coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on islands and lakes.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national sport, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same is true for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example in the Netherlands, the number is 1 in 40).
Most Baltic Sea cruises also offer an extended stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
It means you have a couple of full days to visit the historic city while you return to the ship for the night.
If you are going to the coast only for a cruise ship excursion, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include the German city of Berlin.As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for passengers of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that so many people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help overcome the fear of the unknown or of not having things under control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery, and time is often of the essence when it comes to commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and smaller companies, there is a problem.
When the goods were sent by air freight, unloading and transhipping could take days on some routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so here you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to set aside a lot of money for the privilege (or ideally, to get your company to do it for you).
But it will not be cheap: you can expect to pay an estimated four times the normal fare for business class and up to eleven times for first class!
In general, it is also not worthwhile to look for discounts on business or first class tickets for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations between the two parts of Moldova have been resumed despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Ä°zmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna has become a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, stretching out around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
With wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings, and modern shopping centers, there are houses with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches.
The village of HaldarsvÃ­k overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
The cemetery has interesting marble statues of doves above some of the graves.
It is worth taking a half-hour walk around the interesting village.
In the north, the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra is within reach, a city known to outsiders and made famous by Lord Byron's brilliant poem about its wonders.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintry, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north is the important shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (the tomb), the site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please keep in mind that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and also a site of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who spent a portion of their lives there, and many more whose loved ones were murdered or worked to death there, both Jewish and Gentile.
Please treat the site with the utmost dignity, with all the seriousness and respect it deserves.
Do not damage the site by writing or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.About half of the population prefers to communicate in Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and Spanish is spoken by virtually everyone.
However, most signs and labels are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
Spanish is still commonly used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular metro announcements are only reported in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are reported by an automated system in different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to keep one's head in Paris is still to behave as best one can and to act like one is "bien Ã©levÃ©" (well-behaved).
The rigid Parisian air will quickly evaporate if you show a little courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, with a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animals and birds.
Rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and tetra, along with many other common species, can be found here.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one of bright colors, the monk or nun may smile upon you as you enter.
The same regulations require men to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow these from the pantry at the entrance, but be aware that the clothes are not washed for each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these dresses.
Like other Mediterranean cuisines, the cuisine of Mallorca is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (primarily pork), and olive oil is a staple.
A simple favourite dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes or other accompaniment such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns and personal pronouns begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between verbs and objects.
It also helps to simplify reading, but writing is a bit more complicated because of the need to distinguish whether a verb or an adjective is used in the plural.
Pronunciation in Italian is quite simple, since most words are pronounced the same way they are written
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Remember that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means expensive and carro is a carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer could help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
True, if you have a command of a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that there is no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now usually obsolete and remain in use as museums or educational sites.
They're usually found in cities or on campuses, because they were built in their heyday, when there was no light smog problem, and they're more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized only for the emperor and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to take just one.
If you visit a finely-manicured garden, collecting 'samples' will also, without discussion, ensure your expulsion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
However, if you are in the 'high tropics' just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with heat (always) and also with strong sun (on clear days, less often).
Several buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are considering goes to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good subject for a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or a boat trip on the Erythraean Canal.
In addition, there are popular hiking and cycling routes in the area.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christendom, celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many holiday traditions in Christendom have been adopted by nonbelievers and non-Christians around the world.
Traditionally, you will stay up at night under the open sky to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with services often celebrating the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either swam, flew or swam here.
The great distance from the mainland prevented mammals from making this journey, and the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos, many mammals have been brought to the area, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you may experience a polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It will be a good opportunity to observe the aurorae, as the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
And you'll be able to enjoy the stars, too, because light smog is not a problem in sparsely populated areas.
Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what people in the West are used to.
Suits are common work clothes, and coworkers address each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is key, emphasising the efforts of the group rather than the achievements of individuals.
Often, employees must obtain the approval of their superiors before any decision is made, and they are expected to follow their instructions to the letter.
