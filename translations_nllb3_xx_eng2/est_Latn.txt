Besides proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a widely accepted theory - it allows us to see details that are not normally seen in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The researchers said the animal's abdomen was chestnut brown and its underside was pale or yellowish-red.
The find will allow us to look at the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a developed tubule called the suleroid, but do have other parts of the feathers - the sleeve and the fuzzy base of the sleeve - the researchers concluded that the suleroid likely evolved later than the rest.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or demonstration, and the researchers suggested that the specimen is an example of adult gills, not chick feathers, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur.
Scientists speculated that although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen showed the adult's larynx, not the chick's.

In France, voting has traditionally been a technology-free experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed piece of paper with the name of the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voters' list.
The procedural rules of the French electoral law are formulated in legislation in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can be assured that at the beginning of voting there are no envelopes in the box and no envelopes are inserted in it other than those which have been duly counted and inserted by voters entitled to vote.
Candidates may send representatives to monitor every part of the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, who follow specific instructions.

Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
When the car hit the house, there were three people inside, but none of them were hurt.
The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken for treatment to James Paget's Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his son.
He's being held in custody pending charges and a trial, but any witness testimony could be of questionable value, as his image has been published in many places.
This is standard practice elsewhere in the UK, but in Scotland the justice system works differently and the courts consider the publication of the photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects and so on.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the indictments, has told reporters that they will not comment further, at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East war border.
Other topics discussed included the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that after the signing of the agreement, the military presence in the valley be guaranteed for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep the army only for five years.
The shooters participating in the supplementary pest control test were closely monitored by the forest rangers, as the test was under surveillance and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
The NPWS and NSW affiliated companies recruited qualified volunteers under the NSW Hunting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and cultural heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional election board yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous acting president as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The failure to organise elections, some of which had been expected since 2011, was at times the catalyst for violent protests.
There have been reports of about 60 iPod failures due to overheating, which has resulted in a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
According to the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), there were 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
"In response, the State Department called the delay in Apple's report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (09.19 GMT Friday night).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Response Agency said there were no reports of damage in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an old lady who needed to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the Auckland State Hospital for Women in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that when a certain hormone is given to fetuses, it accelerates the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two of the plane's black boxes from the flight recorder on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen, my first manager, and she left us in the middle of the night two months ago, a very special, very special woman, a very strong woman".
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels commented that ""Luna was as strange as I am... maybe even stranger... I love her and miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now"."
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree, preferring that Queen Elizabeth II remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme of the results, 29% of those polled believe Australia should become a republic at the earliest opportunity, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three medley events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, his fitness is in doubt.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs to get over the pain because it's banned at the Olympics.
On January 25, mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime number known to man.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets supplied the Earth with water, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed the same-sex marriage legalization bill last month.
He called the rumors political bullshit and nonsense.
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel every year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Instead of the older technology based on ground-based radars, it uses satellite-based technology that allows air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
'There is no additional transport and no overground train stops at Wembley, and there are no overground car parks or 'park and ride' facilities.'
Fear of a lack of transportation was raised by the possibility that the game would be played behind closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although it was thought that the process would take much longer.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes, rolled into tiny designs.
It can be stretched into thin strands that can be twisted or braided into a palm tree.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of the chemical, and you can make an indicator of the red head with the juice.
Cabbage juice changes colour depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is the amount of hydrogen ions (H is the pH of hydrogen) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders together and then squeeze it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layers, which creates a funny feeling, and it forms a shell.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a water closet connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of sewerage systems have been found in Crete, in houses of the Minoan civilization cities, and in Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were mixed.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision a little bit.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket that is over 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most significant change it has brought to us is a much easier and faster way of transportation.
Thanks to it, we have a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below these levels are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and goats.
Finally, there are many small felines (including stray domestic cats) that eat much more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job each cat does that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups, called pairs.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually very closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds often behave like wolf and dog herds - animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and only these four cats can roar.
The tiger's roar is not the loud roar of a lion but rather a sentence of rattling words.
The otter likes to eat small animals, and when they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, all of which are much smaller than the otter.
Scientists believe that the stingrays track and locate prey by scent, sniffing out the places where they have been.
With excellent night vision and stealthy movements, the otter blends into its surroundings to hunt prey and then swoops in on its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, they move across a mountain range or river, or they move to a new island, and it is not easy to return), they often end up in a different environment from the one they came from.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics from those previously required and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, they look less and less like the other population.
The result is that, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process the species transition, which is simply the emergence of a new species, and the species transition is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants use photosynthesis to make food from the sun, and they also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mosaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosaurus.
Its long jaws had over 70 extra-sharp teeth, plus extra teeth in the mouth, meaning that nothing that crossed its path escaped.
We don't know for sure, but the mosasaur may have had a bilingual tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anyone who went into the water, even a giant dinosaur, as if the T-Rex were no match for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, acorns, and a rodent called the sleeping mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate sitting down in chairs, the rich men enjoyed banquets where they ate in a lounging position.
Ancient Roman food could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests provided for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests may enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called sikhurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was dedicated to the god of the sanctuary.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Jewish family carried out most of its activities outdoors.
Women cooked outside; shops were simply open shelves facing the street; houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
According to ancient Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it a name.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed greatly.
If you've seen the movie "Treasures of the Nation", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map drawn on it.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words, 'The original of the Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text is inverted on the bottom of the document".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early years a large parchment document (measuring 29 3⁄4 by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it's likely that the sign was simply added as a label.
D-Day and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the people of France who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an action that came to be known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and liberated French forces had liberated the south of France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "citizen", which is related to the Latin words civis, "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city or city-state", and it also defines to some extent the size of a society.
City states are the precursors of states.Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge over generations, a lasting cultural footprint and adequate cultural survival.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies, under the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, with Congress as the only body.
Congress had no power to impose the tax, and, lacking national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enact all legislation.
Nor did it have the power to repeal tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the most successful team in the world alongside the German national football team, and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, netball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Tennis is most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in this sport at international and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the Japanese island cluster, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan was mentioned as early as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by spelled the island's name Ilha Formosa, or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures , the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most commonly used format for photographic film in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its proportions inherited the dimensions of the image sensors in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually a bit confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm long.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore assumed to be 3: 2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS group of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The oft-abused and often-ridiculated rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of regularity in the image.
According to this, the most efficient location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervasive power affected everyone, from the king down to the commoner.
A fundamental Christian belief is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's funds are designed to do just that.
The center of ecclesiastical power had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised many questions about whether this principle was being observed.
Soon after the war began, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective  it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, as enshrined in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain planted mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral bases.
With no significant response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a large proportion of the citizens and peoples were pacifist and isolationist.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job in New York City with the Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with a 4-cent bill, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each stage of Chinese history, or each ruling family, had a separate dynasty.
There were also periods of provinces that were divided unstably between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there was fierce fighting between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history  thousands of people died in internal conflicts because they hoped to gain the highest position in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, the fields of activity were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they were now based on military merit.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things deeper than worldly life, and he often meditated in a cave on Mount Noor ('light') that came to be known as Hira.
The cave, which has survived the test of time, provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, situated on the top of a mountain north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you were told it exists, because once you're in the cave, it's completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but a clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and the cave is breathtaking and shows very little of this world.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World to have survived to the present day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many giant pyramidal structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign 'turn upright' is similar to the letter 'V' and the sign 'turn down' to a clasp or a square with a missing bottom.
"Upper" means you should start from the top and push the lever, and "Lower" means you should start from the crown of the lever (where your hand holds the lever) and pull the lever.
The upper strophe produces a softer sound, but the lower strophe is stronger and more forceful.
Feel free to write your own symbols, but remember that the printed strokes are there for a musical reason and should be respected.
Frightened, Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of Paris's market vendors.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob that shouted and shouted threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, one of the crowd members waved the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles to the Queen, who was startled.
The military costs of the US imperialist invasion of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States of America to cover the costs of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were being processed by Wall Street banking institutions on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits made from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the elemental profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, you must understand the context that inspired the Order's creation.
The period when these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, and it was a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early and followed by the Late, which are conventionally dated to the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological drive or technological imperative to the firm belief that human destiny is governed by the logic of the laws of science and its expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely culturally or politically influenced, and that technology itself has effects on society that are intrinsic rather than socially induced.
For example, it can be said that the existence of motor vehicles will certainly lead to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so efforts are being made to develop new production methods to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to more road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques for repairing damaged bodies in health care.
An important part of Romanticism was cultural determinism, based on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography took the form of individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the location of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a place of all luxuries began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered in Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But slow communication channels may have left the styles behind in the West for as long as 25 or 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the Crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming in which food is produced in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Organic farming is a simple, often nature-based system that uses seeds from the ecological area, rotation of crops or other relatively simple methods such as organic farming to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel that societal standards do not apply to them, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, geographical location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through the use of a particular and symbolic style, which includes fashions, behaviors, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the few unfortunate cases where adults failed to socialize children during their upbringing because of neglect, misfortune, or intentional mistreatment.
Such children are called feral or savage, and humans (often their parents) have kept feral children; in some cases, parents abandoned the child because of serious intellectual or physical deficiencies.
The savage children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others were reportedly raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
If a child is fully raised by an animal, the wild child will behave (within physical limits) almost exactly like the animal that raised it, for example, fearing or being indifferent to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the approach to educational scales is a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a learning method but rather a way of supporting people who are acquiring a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be virtual or real, in other words, it can be a teacher or a little Microsoft Office pencil-man.
The software integrates virtual steps to challenge, reference and explain procedures that may be too complex for the student to handle alone.
Children are taken into orphanages for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, but it does happen.
We find that the foster system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The adoptive family should provide for all the needs that were not present in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet bring additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are cited as important drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified personal involvement and continuing relationships as new motivating aspects when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds, or micro-expressions.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting the micro-print, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still recognize sincerity accurately.
He even suggested that such interpretative abilities exist in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has revealed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
With a mutation, a new genetic variation is added, and selection removes it from the collection of variations that have been produced.
In the case of separation and recombination, the diversity fluctuates back and forth between the two funds in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans has difficulty meeting its amino acid needs with the help of available plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant sources would have been the proteins in leafy vegetables, but for primates like us, they're easy to digest only when cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (seals, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
With all of this in mind, it should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep disturbance is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
It's easy if you use a comparatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you find that you turn off your alarm clock while you are sleeping, you may set it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to press it.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea of a known diuretic) before bedtime to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive life force is present, and it is possible for every person to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only obstacle to achieving enlightenment is tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was extended in the past with the path of love and various Indian yoga techniques.
The basic structure of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it involves Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations, Kundalini yoga is used to awaken the energy of Kundalini (the light energy).
Central to Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods, through the visualization of the various gods, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and after the war, the two countries clashed over system, process and culture.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the authorized armies would have to fight in real battles from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgeheads.
However, these plans were shattered almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after conquering eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is unquestionably the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to ensure that the state can move people and goods, while preventing the enemy's ability to move those people and goods.
One of the most recent and notable examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, which was mainly a submarine force, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were originally domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept as herders, roaming on mounds or other pastures, and were often herded by young or adolescent goats, similar to the more well-known sheep herds, and these herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted of nothing but parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger quantities than on the slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
Early on, the use of railings was to hold tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that tracks were more effective if they had iron bars on top of them.
This became the standard method, but the iron consumed more than the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were put into use.
The first known form of transport was walking. Homo erectus (or upright man) began walking upright two million years ago.
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, was not accustomed to walking upright.
Examples of two-legged specialization are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce some of the suffering in the future, we can start living more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists.
Often, it's just like treating the symptoms, but if we don't want a temporary fix, we need to find the root cause of the problem and make it go away.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a great deal because of man's scientific and technological advances, and problems have been increased by overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, the manuscript of the bill, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the John Dunlap printing plant a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap copies.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 at Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
25 The copy made by Dunlap is the oldest surviving copy of the Declaration.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many other features of birds that make them look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary form.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or  when used for the computation of length  bits.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are quite general and do not allow for an immediate diagnosis.
A clear sign of ingested or ingested poison may be an open package of medication or toxic household chemicals in the vicinity.
Refer to the label for instructions on first aid for the specific toxin.
Entomologists use the term bugs officially for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the insect's familiarity with insects that are extremely well adapted to live as parasites on humans.
Both robber and bed bugs are brood parasites, adapted to life in the nest or in the host's home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples may choose to give their child up for adoption.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can be the child's parents.
The fundamental purpose of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works, and in fact, it is the basis for most scientific research.
Research is not only about experimenting - an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses - but also about asking questions and observing.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's scientific views, including his psychological ones, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often dependent on endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
The occurrence of periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic factors, has been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillatory system that continues to run freely in cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that suggested that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage with either radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural places to enjoy the views and also the wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about the Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and others whose jobs are in the same area they left pass by.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the private vehicle transport system.
Science has now shown that this vast carbon-producing economy has upended the biosphere from one of the stable states that has been conducive to human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems complain about everyday failures, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study that looks at the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because the behaviour of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent to some extent, and they can be represented mathematically in a broad way.
To better describe the traffic flow, links have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links contribute to the planning, design and operation of the road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to use air as a means of transport, and their ability to fly made it much easier for them to avoid enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects are able to fold their wings against their body.
This gives them more opportunities to find small hiding places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that are unable to turn their wings back are the kiwi and the day-fly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought otherwise. The solar system, along with the sun (and even other stars), moved around the earth.
That makes sense, because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world, and it carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at times six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of the pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids or the technical knowledge of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the country's working people, while Latin is used in religious services.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they are found naturally in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four aggregate states (in the same order)  solid, liquid, gas and plasma state , although he also speculated that they form the new substances that we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals, and don't forget, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that they would fit into the trillion-dot number at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil was first introduced, it was a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its importance and use because of the development of new writing methods.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to use a scraper.
One can only speculate what will become of the keyboard when something new is created.
The nuclear bomb works by taking energy to make the nucleus of a cell stick together with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay in small clumps or spontaneously.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick at the front and 100 kilometers thick at the back.
It's thinner under warm seas and thicker under mountainous terrain.
The closer side, there may be more sea, because the crust is thinner, so the lava was easier to surface.
Achievement theories try to understand what makes people act and what makes them like it.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are acquired as they mature.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want the things they do, and what environmental factors make those people do or not do certain things.
The two most popular needs-based theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
When managers start to lead their former peers, this can generally lead to two types of behaviour: one end of the spectrum is trying to remain 'single boys (or girls) '.
It is difficult for this type of manager to make unpopular decisions, to call for order, to make assessments, to assign duties and to hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum is the person who becomes unknown, feeling that he has to change everything the team has done so far and make it his own.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often causes friction between the leaders and the rest of the crew.
The requirements for virtual teams are the same as for regular teams, but there are still some minor differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for their live team.
They usually have more autonomy than normal team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The so-called invisible team is an administrative team to which each member reports.
The reason why a company would undertake the activity of creating a learning organisation for young people is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across the functional departments of the organisation, creativity and inventiveness will emerge.
As a result, the company can develop a new inventive process that meets the customer's needs in order to overcome the barrier to cooperation.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and also of shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help companies achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and thus it delineates and refines the field of study.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gave us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us better understand the processes that go on in our brains.
Although AI is strongly associated with science, forms of AI are a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves automating machines in such a way that they solve tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, responding to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is also built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every class, and often the teacher would like to take the students to places that can't be reached by bus.
Technology is providing a solution through virtual excursions, where students can sit in class and view museum objects, visit an aquarium or admire fine art.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on one trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students at North Carolina's Bennett School design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year, the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept as a reminder.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills, and while students often start their blogging experience with loose grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Also, 'blogging forces students to know the world around them better.' 'Attracting the attention of readers encourages students to be astute and interesting (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can determine their position on other people's writing and provide an overview of their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's splendid bilingual capital, and it has a wide variety of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Farther south is the Niagara Falls, and farther north is the Muskoka and the unspoilt natural beauty of the area beyond.
All of the above and more highlights Ontario as a distinctive feature of Canada for foreigners.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated and at times almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a surprising population comparison, the United States has more African-Americans than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest continent in terms of land mass and is practically a continent in its own right in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or linked to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that female travellers, regardless of their marital status, state that they are married.
Also, wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that because of cultural differences, they may be subjected to what they consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, to be grabbed, and so on.
Say no to men firmly and don't be afraid to stick to your guns (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's okay!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Maronites used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan Daru I-Badyana, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as backpacks, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of gadgets, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the downtown area.
In addition, the FDLR has conducted a number of attacks on civilians in Goma, including the bombing of the military air base in Goma in March 2014.
It is also a base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and offers the best opportunities for observing the mountain gorillas of Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-bodat (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
In conjunction with its comparatively difficult accessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places.
Timbuktu is a poor city, although its fame makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert lions.
It was one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
Compared to other cities in the country, it is completely different because it has more of an Arabic than an African flavor.
Kruger National Park (KRP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports a different type of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South Arabian parks, daily conservation and entry fees apply.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to certain South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider to be a major attraction.
The line of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to the glowing tulip patterns that appear in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kwloon coast across from it.
A large number of Hong Kong Island's urban development projects are located in the land along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took over, so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of colonial occupation of the territory.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the remaining part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests, however, are not just a habitat for mangroves - they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once touched the Ganges Basin.
Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or salts.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has also been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 star deer now live in the area.
Buses depart from the Inland Bus Terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable, and robust Japanese shore buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paros (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 273 feet [83 m], the bridge is 1,292 feet [378 m] long, and it has two 12-foot [3.5 m] wide lanes.
The bridge has a through-traffic height of 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011 but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group to settle in the areas of present-day eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic life of hunting and agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the native peoples gave birth to Paraguay, formerly called the giant province of the Indies.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character.
It is well known that Argentina's water polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can be seen here at other times of the year.
Tournament news and tickets for polo matches can be found on the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is set at the value of one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted at Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and United States currency may be accepted; consult with the owners to determine the appropriate payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with temperatures above +30 °C being common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, they are still wild animals and should not be disturbed.
According to the park authorities, bears and wolves must be kept at least 100 yards away and all other wildlife 25 yards away!
No matter how peaceful they may appear, buffalo, beavers, deer, bears, and basically any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these are large, wild animals that are potentially dangerous, so give them the space they need.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and it is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval dispute of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with nearly 200 Americans and Germans killed.
During the freedom struggle led by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the killing of Grand Chief Lealof III of Tupua Tamasese.
Because Auckland is bordered by two harbours, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore (North Harbor area) beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay (north) to Denvonport (south).
Almost all of these are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most of them offer shade from tall iron-bearing trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and central Auckland's St Heliers.
These are overcrowded beaches for family vacations, lined with a good selection of shops.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not complex in taste but pleasant and refreshing.
French wine may be plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more suitable for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, flat white coffee is a foreign concept. Short black is espresso, while cappuccino is served with lots of cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and it is rare for any of them to cause injury to the reef.
However, listen to the authorities, follow all signs, and heed safety warnings.
The new chestnut occurs near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of the same name, and occasionally can be found outside the period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the ocean, but in the river basins north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can find other accommodation options, such as camping sites, through the travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also keep your reservation if you want to reconsider the offer or obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) for the destination.
Any changes and requests should be discussed first with the tour operator and not directly with the hotel.
For some music festivals, most participants choose to camp on site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be near the mill, you'll have to get there early to get the camp near the music.
Keep in mind that while the main stages may no longer be open to music, there may be other stages at the festival that will play until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check where your cabin is located, because driving through the ice makes a pretty loud noise for nearby cabins.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Usually, casinos try to keep guests in as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and not to leave.
Some places offer alcohol on the house, but being drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who travels over high latitudes or over mountain ranges should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or flying snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic remains more or less constant throughout the year.
Perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction is the safari, a highlight of many visitors' journeys.
The popular term "safari" refers to overland travel to discover African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to cars, and standard equipment is sufficient to observe them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes spotted and are easier to see with binoculars.
'A bush walk, hiking safari or footing is a journey of a duration of either a few hours or several days.'
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, the host of the 1964 Games, becomes the only Asian city to host the Olympics twice.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation rules do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were due to take place.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥13 0000 and that standard tickets will cost around ¥7000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed even if they are not in your room.
If you do not have a knit ring or if you do not want to wear knit socks, you may try to use a cord if one is available.
Be careful not to make the cloth too hot (which may cause it to contract or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies and if you are concerned you should consider buying bottled water from a reliable manufacturer in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home area.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or carry infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont introduces the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, passing through often isolated wooded tracts of land.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp turns are common.
The speed limits are considerably lower than in the preceding and following sections  usually 3540 miles per hour (5664 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
But strangely, the cell service here is much stronger than in many other parts of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wild.
German cookies are quite good, and Bavarian cookies are quite rich and varied, similar to those of Austria, its southern neighbour.
Fruit crops are common, with apples being baked into buns all year round and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some hard, rich bakery, try the biscuits called berliner, pfannkuchen, or krapfen, depending on the region.
Karri is a dish based on herbs and spices with either meat or vegetables.
The vessel may be dry or liquid, depending on the volume of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is generally used.
Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country, allowing you to choose from 17,000 islands.
But when used without any adjectives, the term tends to refer to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, widely available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply flavored dishes, with peanut, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices as Javanese favorites.
The legs on either side of the saddle are designed to support the rider's legs.
They help the rider to maintain balance, but they can be dangerous because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse but his foot gets caught in the leg, the horse may drag him away in a run, and precautions should be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a saddle and a smooth, rather narrow saddle.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the pedestrian to get off the saddle when the falling rider pulls him back.
The Cochamo Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, is home to a variety of large granite rock walls and cliffs.
From the tops of the mountain ranges, breathtaking views are revealed, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes on the rock walls of this infinite potential.
Mountain snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of descending on snow-covered ground on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity among many enthusiasts, known occasionally as ski-bums, who plan their entire vacation around skiing in one particular location.
Skiing is very old - there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5,000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport was practiced as early as the 17th century, and in 1861 the first amateur skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called wild skiing, ski touring or skiing.

Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries.Typically, crossing several countries means applying for a visa and passing through passport controls several times.
But in this respect, the Schengen area is acting somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay within that zone, you can basically cross the border without going through passport control again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen Member State separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.

In the case of backflow currents, the water flows back from the shore, often from a penalty or something similar.
Because of the underwater landforms, the returning water flows to a couple of deeper spots, and there can be a rapid current that heads into deeper water.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from swimming against the tide, because it can be an impossible task.
Once you're out of the race, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to move to a place where it won't drag you back in, or in case you don't have the skills and you've been spotted, you can wait for a rescue team.

Finland is a great destination for boating, and the so-called land of a thousand lakes also has a thousand islands, both in lakes and in coastal islets.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to travel between islands and lakes.
While the archipelagos and larger lakes of the coast are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.

For some, understanding the workings of aircraft and what happens during flight can help overcome the fear of the unknown or of lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of packages.Often time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller companies had problems.
When goods were sent by air, it could take days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to get through this faster was to send it in checked baggage, and the airline rules don't allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class is to pay a hefty sum for that luxury (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
But it is not cheap: As a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times as much for business class and 11 times as much for first class as for a standard economy class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
