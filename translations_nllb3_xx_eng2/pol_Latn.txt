This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional structure that you can't get from fossils.
According to scientists, the animal's plumage was chestnut on the top and light or carotene on the bottom.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed trunk called a stalk, but have different features - feathers  radii and rays  - scientists concluded that the stalk was probably a later evolutionary stage than these other features.
The feather structure indicates that it was not used for flight but for temperature control or display, and scientists believe that this is the plumage of an adult rather than a chick, even though the tail belonged to a young dinosaur.
The researchers suggested that although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathering on the specimen indicated an adult rather than a chick.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of a galaxy in the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon affects the Earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts its power on the Sagittarius galaxy.
And what scientists have been able to deduce is that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that standard matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter is surrounding the galaxy like a kind of halo, made up of many small molecules.
The television reports show white smoke billowing from the power plant.
Local authorities are warning residents in the area of the plant to stay indoors, turn off the air conditioning and not drink tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll has identified an extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very troubling and worrying because of its high mortality rate".
According to Dr. Moll, some of the patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were health care workers employed by the hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he or she has been in close contact.
However, the incidence of XDR-TB in the TB population still seems low, with 6,000 of the 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

In France, voting was usually a low-tech process: Voters cast their ballots in a voting booth and then put a printed card with the name of their chosen candidate inside an envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict about the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers have no doubt that there are no envelopes in the ballot box when the polling station is opened and that no envelopes are thrown in except those of duly numbered and authorised voters.
Candidates have the opportunity to send their representatives to observe each stage of the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision and in accordance with established procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her cell phone and laptop".
The following persons have been named as accused persons: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were rescuing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial in Edinburgh County Court on charges of murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness accounts may be unreliable because her image has been widely publicized.
It's common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts believe that publishing the photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are entering dangerous territory by publishing photos of suspects and so on".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for the overall investigation, has told reporters that any further comment is suspended until at least the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will be about the disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, the holy city of both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel has demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, and the AP has agreed to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by the foresters, as the test was monitored and subject to an evaluation of the effectiveness.
The NPWS and NSW have partnered to recruit qualified volunteers for the NSW Hunting and Sporting Programme.
Mick O'Flynn, conservation and heritage director of NPSW, believes that the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission requested the dissolution of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to speed up the country's new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were a response to the lack of elections, which have been blocked in some cases since 2011.
There have been over 60 reported cases of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating, which has caused six fires and four people to be slightly burned.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, calling them "non-harmful".
When Apple postponed the report, the department called the decision "very unfortunate".
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Crisis Management Office has reported no damage to the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there are no tsunami warning signs.
A bus carrying tourists from Hong Kong was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Filipino police officer who took the passengers hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued and at least six are presumed dead.
The Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early.
Then the photographers took the place of an old woman who needed a bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Hospital for Women in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his time off to begin research on preterm birth.
His study showed that the introduction of the hormone would accelerate the development of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered the black boxes on Wednesday.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, and she died on the night of the double moon, which was as special as she was.
Dustin Goldust Runnels said that Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even crazier... and I love her and I'm gonna miss her... and I can only hope she's better now.
A survey of 1,400 people was conducted before the 2010 federal election, and the percentage of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
Supervising Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic with the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents agree with this and want Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme points of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but as he complained about his form, doubts were raised about his expected results.
The pain medication was prohibited by the rules of the games, so he couldn't take it.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using other hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is thought that comets may have brought water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to learn more about how planets form, especially about how Earth formed when comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed into law a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political babble and nonsense".
There's been speculation that he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
The use of satellite technology instead of older radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There will be no additional transport options, no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and furthermore car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable in the ground floor.
The potential lack of transportation made it possible for the match to be held behind closed doors without the participation of the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that a new species had been created in just two generations, although it was thought that the process took much longer, based on the reproduction of Darwin's finches, black darlings, cactus darlings, and fat-tailed darlings.
Gold can be worked into many shapes, even the tiniest.
It can be stretched into thin wires that can be twisted and braided, and it can be folded or rolled up on sheets.
It can be thinly sanded and glued to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
And we call this the pH of a chemical, and the juice of the red cabbage has the ability to detect pH.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H, abbreviated pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with your clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to a modern sewer system.
In houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece, remains of a sewage system have been discovered.
Toilets were also known in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets sometimes belonged to public baths where men and women shared.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The call goes to a satellite in space, and then it bounces back almost immediately,
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts the light that is visible from the earth.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space requires the use of a huge rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in many amazing ways, but most of all, it has made transportation much easier and faster.
Without it, there would be no railways, no cars, and no other means of transportation.
Below that are the medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey: rabbits, antelopes, all the way down to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic ones) that eat much more of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche, the special task that each cat performs, which makes it impossible for them to compete with the others.
Lions are among the most sociable of cats, and they live in large herds.
A pride of lions consists of one, two, or three related adult males and as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming one big family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions behave like a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior and the deadly threat they pose to their prey.
A well-built athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for considerable distances, and pull five times as fast as a strong man.
The tiger, along with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, is a member of the genus Panthera, and these four are the only mammals that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not as loud as that of a lion, but it is more like a tangled, shouted word.
Ocelots are known to prey on small animals, and when they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and most of the ocelot's prey is much smaller than the ocelot itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find food by smell.
They have excellent night vision and they move stealthily, hunting their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (e.g. when moving over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island without the possibility of easy withdrawal), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to develop new traits or adapt in a way that they can compete effectively in their new environment.
The original population hasn't changed a bit and it still has to adapt the same way.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different from each other that it's hard to call them one species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen for humans to breathe and absorb carbon dioxide for humans to exhale.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce nutrients, and plants also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we make most of our food from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mozazaurus was the largest predator at the time, so the only thing it feared were other Mozauruses.
With over 70 sharp teeth in its elongated jaws, and an extra set of teeth protruding from the lower jaw, it was a deadly weapon.
We're not entirely sure, but it could have had a forked tongue, and it could have fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, it could have even been a cannibal.
It didn't shy away from attacking its prey in the water, and even a dinosaur as massive as a T. rex must have felt a certain reverence for it.
While we are familiar with most of the foods that the Romans ate, their feasts included some exotic dishes, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and suce.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting on tables, while the rich met at banquets, where they ate in a semi-reclining position.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have contained the ingredients that would have found their way to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
In Babylon each of the gods had a main temple dedicated to him, which was considered his home.
Sacrifices to the gods were made by humans, and the priests were responsible for caring for the divine needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard behind which was an inner sanctuary, accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
A special sanctuary dedicated to the god was located on the top of the tower.
The house was not particularly important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in their backyards, shops were just plain shelves facing the street, and stones were used to build houses.
Since there were no large forests in Canaan, the price of timber was very high.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his journey westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, without diminishing his role as a discoverer, it should be noted that the Eskimo tribes were already inhabiting the area at that time.
While each country could be described as "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ from one another in people, rulers, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie "Treasure of Nations", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a map to the treasure.
There are some inscriptions on the back of the document, but it's not a map to the treasure.
On the other side of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The inscription is at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but what is known is that this large parchment document (measuring 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was originally nailed down for storage.
It can therefore be assumed that the annotation was added as a descriptive label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent fighting had liberated the north of France, but the south remained under occupation.
The French Vichy were the ones who made peace with Germany in 1940 and cooperated with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, known as Operation Dragoon.
It took only two weeks for the US and Free French forces to liberate southern France and move towards Germany.
A civilization is one culture shared by a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, which is cognate with civis, which is citizen, and civitas, which is city or city-state, which is also a measure of the size of a community.
The city-states were the prototypes of nations, and the culture of civilization is the transmission of knowledge across many generations, the making of lasting cultural traces, and the equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence behind, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first established a fragile central government, the only component of which was Congress, based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state governments, which often were unwilling to cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
Furthermore, he had no authority to override the laws and rates of taxation between the states.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all the states before any changes could be made, and the states treated the central government with such disdain that their representatives often did not appear.
Alongside the German national team, the Italian national football team is ranked second in the world football rankings, and in 2006 won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italian athletes compete in international tournaments and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/groups of islands it has, Japan is often called an archipel in the geographical sense.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors spelled the island's name Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island".
When the Dutch East India Company established a factory in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, it began to implement changes in native grain production practices and employed Chinese to work on rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) troops took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, giving Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, three main structures stand out: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
To better portray the original appearance of the site to visitors, most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, one third of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the process is still ongoing.
For example, in photography, the most commonly used format is 35 mm, the most common film size in the late analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, this image format has been ported to the matrix formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is quite confusing.
So the ratio for this format (we divide by twelve to get the simplest total ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS group of formats) are identical or very similar to this ratio.
The rule of thirds is often abused or ridiculed, but it's a simple guideline to help you achieve dynamism without disrupting order.
He states that the ideal location for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the photograph into three equal parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and prosperous, came under close scrutiny.
For more than a millennium, the Christian religion has provided a vital link between European countries with different languages and customs.
His power was so overwhelming that it affected everyone from the king to the peasant.
One of Christendom's main tenets is that wealth should be used to help the poor and needy and that church funds should be used for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raises the question of whether this doctrine is being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy effectively cut off key military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law as enshrined in several international agreements over the previous two centuries.
Britain had mined international waters to block ships from entering vast swathes of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
This tactic met with limited response, so the Germans expected a similar situation for their unforgiving underwater warfare operations.
The 1920's are characterized by pacifism and isolationism among most nations and citizens.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla settled in the United States due to his work at the Edison Company in New York.
He set foot on American soil with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different periods were uniquely shown; each stage in China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
In the transitional periods of kinglessness between successive dynasties, the provinces were plunged into confusion and division, the Three Kingdoms period spanning the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties being the most famous such period.
Many notables who claimed the throne clashed with each other in fierce battles during these periods.
The Three Kingdoms era was a period of great bloodshed in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for supremacy in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not just to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, all male candidates were given free access to the professions, allowing those who showed the greatest ambition and resourcefulness to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because the ranks of the military, which used to be based on class, are now based on the sword.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his ordinary life, and he often went to contemplate in a cave known as Hira on Mount Noor (Mountain of Light).
The preserved cave itself gives a very colorful insight into Muhammad's spiritual predilections.
The cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's not easy to find, even if you know it's there, because inside the cave, the visitor is in total isolation.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, you can't see or hear much of the outside world.
The only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau (also called the Giza Necropolis) in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest being Cheops' pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The up symbol looks like the letter V and the down symbol looks like a pin or a square with no bottom.
Up means you start at the tip and press the string, and down means you start at the frog's head (that's where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
Moving the string from bottom to top produces a softer sound, and moving the string from top to bottom produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
Don't be afraid to draw your own signs, but remember that the printed signs on the string are there for musical reasons, so generally you should stick to them.
The mob of angry bribe-takers forced the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4) and Elizabeth, the king's sister, to return to Paris from Versailles.
As the king and queen rode back to Paris in their carriage, they were joined by a screaming mob, who threatened them.
The angry mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook the head of a guard killed at Versailles right in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the imperialist United States for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipinos would be the primary profits of U.S. imperialism.
The context in which the Order of the Templars was formed is important to understanding its specificity.
These events belong to the era commonly called the Late Middle Ages, which encompassed the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a broad range of ideas applied in practice, including the technological impulse or technological imperative, and the strict definition of human destiny guided by the hidden logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general principles: first, the process of technology development itself is not influenced by cultural or political factors, and second, technology generates effects in societies that are immanent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of the road network.
Since a nationwide road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is negligible, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of running a vehicle.
The mass ownership of cars has also led to an increase in traffic accidents and, as a result, to the invention of new ways of repairing damaged bodies in medicine.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of such authors as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, individuals were shaped by geography, and over time, they developed customs and culture that were tied to that geography, so much in line with the place of the society that they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is now known as the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a place of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1000 C.E.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders brought back goods such as silk and spices, which were valued more than those offered at Byzantine fairs.
It was then that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
But because the exchange of information was slow, the Western styles could develop with a delay of 25-30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is when a farmer produces enough food to feed himself and his family.
Self-supply farming is a simple, often organic system using self-supply of seed from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods of maximising yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures attract people who have similar attitudes to the world, people who feel that social norms do not meet their needs, people who find a sense of identity within the subculture.
Subcultures are distinct in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture in its distinctiveness may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
If you're a member of a subculture, you show it through a distinctive and symbolic style that incorporates fashion, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most popular ways of portraying the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their adolescence  whether due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
Such children are referred to as "wild" or "savage" children, some of whom have been imprisoned (usually by their parents), and some abandoned because their parents were unable to accept the severe mental or physical disability of their child.
Before the abandonment or escape, the children who went wild may have suffered trauma or abuse.
Others are thought to have been raised by humans, and some are said to live in the wild on their own.
If the feral child is cared for by animals only, he will behave almost exactly (with physical limitations) as those animals do, showing fear or indifference toward humans.
The project method should make learning easier and more attractive, whereas the scaffolding method takes learning a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a way of learning, but rather a support provided to people who are participating in a new learning experience, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real, so the teacher is kind of a scaffolding, just like Mr. Spinner in MS Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in software and is designed to challenge, suggest and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to understand on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not provide them with upbringing, care and education, but unfortunately that is what is happening.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to guarantee a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and good medical care.
The foster family is supposed to meet any needs that weren't met in the home they were taken from.
The Internet can be used for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet open up new dimensions in terms of ways of using it and approaches to reward.
For example, 'learning' and 'connecting with others' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal engagement' and 'lasting relationships' were also identified by Eighemey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they studied audience responses to websites.
Video recordings have made important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial muscle movements lasting just a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that you can tell if a person is lying by reading their microexpressions correctly.
In an article entitled "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks argues that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are still able to judge the sincerity of the speaker.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have such abilities to interpret human behavior.
Scientific research over the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation - one hidden and one expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, whereas selection removes the variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is a mutual exchange of variability between the two pools through segregation and recombination.
Plants on the savannah barely allow primates with digestive systems like ours to meet the body's demand for amino acids.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins in the leaves and the pods, but for primates like us, they're difficult to digest without cooking first.
Animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are different, since they are easily digested and provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees do it in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the deliberate awakening during normal sleep and re-falling asleep after 10 minutes 60 seconds.
It's not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you happen to be resetting your watch while you're sleeping, you can put it across the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based methods recommend drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is diuretic) before bedtime so that you have to get up to urinate.
The level of inner calm is inversely proportional to the inner and physical tension of the person.
The less stress there is, the more positive life force there is, and every person has the potential to find total peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that's stopping us is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it also includes the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
The basic tenets of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, and they include Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening the kundalini energy (or enlightenment energy) through the practice of asanas, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity, and through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
During World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were allies against a common enemy, Germany, but after the war ended, a radical clash of systems, processes and cultures divided the two countries.
It was two years after the end of the war when former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and encompass real battles fought by surrogate armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans quickly became irrelevant when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, thus violating the provisions of the Peace of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is by far the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of goods and people across the oceans.
The Navy's mission has always been to keep the nation safe from the enemy's movement of its people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II was one of the most famous examples in recent history, and to help the British, the Americans tried to send men and equipment across the Atlantic.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines primarily, tried to block these leaks.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans would have probably succeeded in conquering Britain, as they would have the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats probably began in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for their milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often guarded by shepherd-like goat herders, usually children or teenagers, and these breeding methods are still used.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks were built on parallel wooden planks, the horses could travel faster and carry larger loads than on the paved roads of the day.
Rail-mounted railway sleepers were relatively early, but it was gradually understood that iron belts were needed to improve the efficiency of the tracks.
This became a common practice, but iron contributed to the increased wear of wooden wagon wheels.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of movement was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, hence the name Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not accustomed to walking upright.
Forms of bipedalism can be found in the fossil Australopithecus dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the green movement, and we can even take on the role of activists to help reduce some of the suffering in the future.
This often resembles symptomatic treatment, but to avoid a temporary solution, the root of the problem must be identified and eliminated.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of scientific and technological advances, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles have exacerbated the problems.
When the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten version of it signed by John Hancock, the President of Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides", were printed overnight.
The document was first read publicly by President John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who ordered it read to his troops on July 9th in New York, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap stamps that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs, just like a T-Rex.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded as a binary system.
A binary number can have a value of 0 or 1, and these kinds of numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal toxicity doesn't necessarily show up right away, but symptoms like vomiting are so common that they don't warrant immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of poisoning is the presence of an open package of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label instructions for first aid in this particular case.
The name worm is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient times, when bedbugs were insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the larval and the house bugs are nesting insects, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
There are about 400,000 cases of MS in the United States, making it the most common neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples can decide to prepare an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption is when the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can be the parents of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover the workings of the world by using the scientific method, which is the basis for most scientific research.
But it's not the only method; an experiment is a test that allows you to reject one or more possible hypotheses.
The classical texts, especially the Latin Bible, provided a basis for the study of naturalists and philosophers.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend essentially on the existence of endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms that are not only responses to external periodic stimuli have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that last for entire cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to implant bacteria with their own DNA.
Two experiments were performed, one labeling the DNA in the flask with radioactive phosphorus, and the other labeling the protein in the flask with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on their type, the importance of the element of genetic material involved, and whether the cells affected are germ line chambers.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children; mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in exploring natural areas, admiring landscapes, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visits to parks and gathering information about the ecosystem.
For example, you can go to Borneo to see and photograph and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people drive out of their small towns to go to work, and on the way, they pass people who are driving to the places they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone participates in some way in and supports the private vehicle transport system.
Now science shows that the vast economy of coal has displaced the biosphere from its steady state, which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is a participant in society and uses transportation, and almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed lands, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why are there malfunctions every day, are engineers responsible for it, or is the problem much deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
There is no way to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty, so unfortunately, studying traffic flow is a challenge.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is generally consistent; therefore, traffic flows also show some consistency and can be approximated by mathematical calculations.
The relationships between three key properties, namely (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed, allow for better visualization of traffic.
The planning, design and operation of road structures make use of such relationships.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly allowed them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have a useful ability to fold their wings along their trunks.
This gives them a greater choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that do not have the ability to fold their wings are the dragonfly and the flying squirrel.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought that he was right, while others held the opposite view, namely, that the solar system, including the sun and other stars, revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest river in the world, and it's the largest river in the world, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, and in places, it's nearly six miles wide.
The Amazon is responsible for 20 percent of the water in the rivers that feed the oceans of the world.
The Amazon River in its main course is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never matched in size and technical perfection by the pyramids at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with wonder at the structures of their ancestors, which had been built over a thousand years.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
In its legislation and official communications, the Vatican uses Italian.
Most of the people who work in Italy use Italian in their daily lives, and Latin is often heard in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, have been known since ancient times because they are naturally occurring and can be extracted relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a combination of at least one of the four elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter, in that order: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized about how they would change into new substances that shape what we see.
Alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals, and it's important to remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Calcium and potassium are elements that are considered to be metals, and of course, silver and gold are also considered to be metals.
Alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, may also exist.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly microscopic that a dot at the end of this task would contain trillions of them.
So when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil lost its status and its use.
People are writing their news using computer screens now and they don't need a time machine at all.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to connect a nucleus to many protons and neurons.
It's like a heavy cart being rolled upside down, and splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that disintegrate with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is covered with rock and dust, and the outer layer of the planet is called the crust.
The cover is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more areas of maria on the visible side, because the crust is less thick here and the lava was easier to penetrate to the surface.
Content theory is about finding out what people are interested in and what appeals to them.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been acquired in the process of growing up into adulthood.
These theories are about what makes some people want to do what they do and what in their environment makes them do certain things and not do others.
Two popular content theories are Maslov's pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers take over from their former colleagues, there are two types of behaviour that can occur: one is an attempt to remain 'one of the team' (or 'one of the team').
This type of manager is reluctant to make unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary action, and avoids evaluating performance, assigning tasks, and accounting for people's work.
The other extreme is to become unrecognizable to someone who feels that he has to change everything the team has done, subordinate it to his own vision.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
This often results in friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence apply to virtual teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for a physical group directly related to them.
They often have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can arrange meetings according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible group' is the management body to which all members are subject.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity flourish when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of the organisation.
As a result, collaboration within the organisation to overcome the obstacles can lead to an innovative process that meets the needs of customers.
To become an innovative organisation, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that helps organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and that narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the scientific research that's being done.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and lead to altered mental function.
With new technology, we can observe and study previously unknown brain structures and processes.
And we're going to be able to take a lot of information and a lot of material from that to build simulation models that allow us to better understand what's going on in the human mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research is about building machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples are: control and planning, the ability to respond to customer statements and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things became separate fields, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering and military technology, and are also embedded in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class, and often a teacher would be happy to take her students to places where buses do not go.
Technology allows students to take virtual field trips, where they can see museum collections, visit an aquarium, or admire artwork from their classroom.
By providing a virtual field trip, you can stimulate reflection on the field trip and share your experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol; every year the website is changed, but the old versions remain online as an album.
Blogs can help students improve their writing skills, and often when they start blogging, their grammar and spelling aren't at their best, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
Blogger starts to make efforts to improve the quality of his writing and avoid criticism, as students often get the toughest grades.
In addition, blogging "makes students more aware of the world around them" and the need to respond to the interests of the audience inspires students to offer intelligent and interesting content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool to inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
By using blogs properly, students can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online posts, they can express their own views on the work of others and their own perspective on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, with many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south of here is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the pristine beauty of the Muskoka district and surrounding regions.
All of these things - and more - clearly indicate that Ontario is considered by outsiders to be the quintessential of Canada.
The vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them virtually uninhabited wilderness.
This population comparison comes as a surprise to many: the number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, east of the African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its wildlife is unique.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or allies of France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European outward migration and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should present herself as married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it doesn't look too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can cause behaviour that they consider harassment, often being followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Say no to men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't mean you can!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen and served the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badya, and Spanish merchants who had trading bases there called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is the last place in all of Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan goods such as Tajins, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide variety of trinkets can be easily purchased within the old Medina, but this is a typical tourist offer.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the eastern end of the country near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, and lava buried most of the city's streets, especially its downtown.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be pre-screened for the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
From the city, you can go hiking on the Nyiragongo volcano and tracking mountain gorillas, which is one of the cheapest hikes in Africa.
Motorcycle taxis (boda-boda) can be used to travel around Goma, and the standard (local) price for a short ride is about 500 CFA francs.
In the context of its relatively inaccessible location, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, yet its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990 the city was placed on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the destruction caused by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "The African Wonder of the World".
This city is definitely different from the rest of the country because it has more of an Arab climate than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each with its own distinct flora and fauna.
It is one of South Africa's biggest attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
There are daily guard fees and park admission fees, as in all other South African national parks.
The purchase of a wild card can be beneficial, as it gives you access to selected parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for many tourists.
The complex array of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to the glittering bar chart of Victoria Bay.
The best view of Hong Kong is from the Kowloon waterfront, across from the city.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's urban island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the site occupied by British colonialists, so it's worth starting to look for traces of the territory's colonial past here.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest belt of mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But forests are not just the quaking of the earth, they are also the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Indian Plain.
The Sundarbans have an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water and wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 reed tigers living there.
Buses depart from the inter-regional bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang.
It is best to buy your ticket several days in advance, as buses between the districts are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small Japanese shore-side buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of transport to nearby places such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the length is 378 meters and has two lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be ready for use in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs offices is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the region of present-day eastern Paraguay, leading a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer life and struggling to make a living as farmers.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", was founded in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadors who clashed with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Other months may also feature tournaments and smaller-scale games.
The Asociación Argentina de Polo offers more information about the games and tickets to the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, credit cards are accepted in Stanley, and American dollars are often accepted.
While on the outermost islands, do not expect to pay by card, although British and American currency may be accepted; it is best to ask the owners in advance for the form of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so you should exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere while it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be colder than it seems: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but when combined with wind and humidity, the feeling of cold is greater than the thermometer indicates.
There are no dry and rainy seasons, and the amount of rainfall is basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to the sight of humans, they are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend that you keep a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wild animals!
Although they may appear benign, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals that need space.
Also, be aware that the scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
In the 1850's, Apia was founded, and it became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
It was here that the infamous naval standoff of 1889 occurred, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British cruiser was lost, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city ended with the assassination of Tupua chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland is spread between two bays, so there are a lot of beaches, and the most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, with safe bathing areas, and most of the shade is provided by metrosideros trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Bay, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Auckland's inner city.
These are often crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops filling the shores.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complicated beer but a pleasant and refreshing one.
It's worth stocking up on some French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for the trip.
You can drink tap water here without any worries, but if you have any doubts, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is unfamiliar to Australians, with "espresso" being the flat white, cappuccino being filled to the brim with cream (not foam), and tea being served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
Many reef expeditions are year-round, and reef injuries caused by any of these causes are rare.
But take the advice of the authorities, follow all the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The conifer is found near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, and occasionally outside of this period.
No one denies the existence of sharks, but their attacks on humans are rare, and most of these creatures are afraid of contact with humans and will run away.
Rosary crocodiles are not active in the oceans, their primary habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance means that the traveler does not have to worry about where he will sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies usually work with specific hotels, although it is possible to book other accommodation, such as camping, with a travel agent.
Travel agencies offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, and combined flight and hotel packages.
Your reservation may be extended if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents needed at your destination (e.g. visas).
Any corrections or requests should go to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on site, and most of them consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action, you have to get there early to find a campsite near the music.
Please note that even after the music performances on the main stages have finished, music will still be heard in some festival sectors until late at night.
Some festivals offer camping sites for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's position, as travel through the ice generates a terrible noise for those most affected.
Flights to St. Petersburg include time in the city.
Casinos are usually very careful to keep their patrons as long as possible and to leave as much money as possible, so there are no windows or clocks, and it's hard to find your way out.
They usually have special offers including food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and stay at home.
Some establishments offer alcohol on a company charge, but sobriety impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know the value of a sober mind.
When driving a vehicle at high latitudes or over mountain passes, conditions such as snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures must be taken into account.
The roads are covered with ice and snow, and the friction is slight, so it is not possible to drive as smoothly as on a clear asphalt surface.
When a blizzard hits, it can quickly snow so much that the road becomes impassable.
Other obstacles to visibility include snow or sleet, or drops of ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many lands, where traffic flows freely year-round.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important event for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to overland journeys undertaken to see the beauty of African nature, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and standard equipment will allow for appropriate viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy, so it's best to observe them through binoculars.
A walking safari can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24 and run through September 5, 2012, with some events hosted at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice (the first time was in 1964).
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the change of date, you may be in a difficult situation.
The rules for cancellations vary, but in late March, most coronavirus-related cancellations do not include July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most ticket prices for events will range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with a typical ticket price of around ¥7,000.
Ironing can speed up the drying of wet clothes, and many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they are not available in the room.
If you do not have an iron or do not want to wear combed socks, you may try using a hair dryer if available.
The fabric must not be subjected to excessive heating, as it may shrink or burn in extreme cases.
There are many ways to purify water, and some are more effective at addressing specific hazards.
Depending on the area, boiling the water for a minute or several minutes may be sufficient.
Filters vary in efficiency, so if you are concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are not native to their home areas.
Pests damage food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, secrete venom, and carry infections.
In general, the category of pests does not include infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in designated places.
Travelers visiting countries with particularly high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on such goods as alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the most difficult stretch for drivers is between Point Marion and Fairmont, often crossing remote forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes on the road, as you will often encounter steep inclines, narrow sections, and sharp turns.
The speed limits are much lower than those for the preceding and following sections (typically 3540 mph, or 5664 km/h), and strict adherence to them is of the utmost importance.
But the interesting thing is that the cell network here is much stronger than on many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds region.
German pastries are quite tasty, and Bavarian pastries are as nutritious and varied as those in Austria, which borders Bavaria to the south.
Fruit pastry is very popular, with boiled apples available all year round, and cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cookies often go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but nutritious dish, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish that is made with herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be 'dried' or 'wet' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common addition to curry dishes, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines from all over the country.
The term without further specification usually refers to the cuisine typical of the central and eastern areas of Java, which is the most important island of the region.
Javanese cuisine, now readily available throughout the archipelago, includes simple spicy dishes, and Javanese favorites include peanuts, chilli peppers, and various aromatic spices.
The saddle is the rider's footstool, which hangs on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may cause safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, the escaping horse can pull him.
First of all, most jockeys wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety device that causes the saddle to fall off if the saddle is pulled by a rearward-facing rider.
The Cochamo Valley is the most important climbing location in Chile, referred to as the Yosemite of South America, and offers a variety of large granite walls and turns.
From the summits, spectacular views are available, and climbers from all over the world continue to chart new routes through the walls, offering countless possibilities.
Winter sports such as downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve sliding down snow on foot-mounted skis or snowboards.
Skiing is the main outdoor activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski nuts", who plan their entire skiing holiday in one place.
Skiing has a very long history - as early as 5000 B.C.E., cave paintings depicted skiers!
