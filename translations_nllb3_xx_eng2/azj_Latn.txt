As a widely held theory, this not only proves that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional graphics.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is pale or cream-colored on the underside and appears brownish-brown on the top.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed central arrow, but had other features such as spines and feathers, researchers concluded that other features such as the central arrow were the result of later evolutionary development.
The shape of the feathers suggests that they were not designed for flight, but rather for body temperature regulation or appearance. During the studies, it was assumed that the feathers were from the tail of a young dinosaur, but resembled an adult feather rather than a baby.
Although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, researchers report that the feathers are similar to those of an adult.
Two police officers were killed and more than twenty people were injured in the explosion of a car bomb at the Gaziantep police headquarters yesterday morning.

They found that the same basic principles applied to other stars applied to the sun, thus establishing that the motion of all stars is related to their brightness and rotation and is not caused by anything else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number associated with the star's plasma flux.
In terms of the inversion of the star's magnetic field, its activity is dependent on the Rossby number, and the smaller the Rossby number, the less activity it will have.

A highly drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis (DR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new form of the disease is "extremely worrying and dangerous because of its very high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some of the patients may have been infected with the virus at the hospital, and that at least two of them are medical staff at the hospital.
An infected person can infect 10 to 15 people who have been in close contact with him for a year.
But the percentage of people who have TB in the group of people who have measles remains low, at about 6,000 of the 330,000 people who are infected in South Africa at any given time.

The so-called "seven sisters" cave entrances all measure a minimum of 100 to 250 metres (328 to 820 ft) in diameter.
Infrared images suggest that they are cavernous, due to the temperature variation between day and night.

According to Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey's Astronomy Division and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, "their thermal motions are not as stable as those in large caverns on Earth, which often support fairly consistent temperatures, but this is due to the presence of these deep holes in the soil".
The voting process in France was usually a low-tech experiment; people participating in the election would go inside a can and place the ballot in an envelope, marking the candidate they voted for on the ballot paper, where the candidates' names were pre-printed.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope containing the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
In France, the electoral process is fully regulated by the electoral law.
After 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that both voters and observers can see that the box is empty when voting begins and that no additional envelopes have been placed in the box afterwards, except for the legitimate ballot papers, which are counted as required.
Candidates may appoint their own representatives to observe each stage of the process. All votes collected are counted in the evening by volunteers following certain procedures and under supervision.

Edgar Vejle suffered injuries to his arms and jaw, and Christopher Schneider's face will need to be rebuilt by surgery.
The gun of the gunman was disarmed when he aimed at the head of the fifth man, and the pain of the sniper continued, with blindness in one eye, a missing part of the skull, and a titanium figure.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a U.S. Air Force base in his homeland.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two separate races within the championship.
He received his "Did not finish the race" rating in his first race, in the slalom, with 36 of the 116 players showing the same result in the race.
She finished tenth in her other competition, the women's giant slalom sit-skiing, with a total time of 4:41:30, 2:11:60 behind first-place Claudia Loesch of Austria and 1:09:02 behind ninth-place Gy√∂ngy Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's sit-skiing team failed to finish the race, and 45 of a total of 117 skiers failed to earn a place in the race in the Giant Slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to the owner by the Madhya Pradesh Police.

At first, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
The Addenbrooke's Hospital, to which he was later transferred, was in Cambridge.
Adekoya, who has since been tried at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, is charged with the murder of his son.
He will remain in custody until charges are filed and the trial begins, but any testimony from witnesses may not be legally binding because his photos have been widely published in the press.
Although this is a practice that is often found in other parts of the United Kingdom, Scottish justice is more different, with courts considering the publication of the images as a potentially harmful step.
"Journalists are swimming in dangerous waters when they publish photos of suspects and other information about them", said Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for all judicial investigations, has told reporters that it will not comment until at least the indictment is known.
The document reportedly will refer to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other issues covered included the future status of Jerusalem, considered sacred by both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands that its military forces remain in the valley continuously for ten years from the date of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to deploy them for only five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control inspection test will be closely monitored by the foresters as the test will be tested and the impact evaluated.
Volunteers with a level of competence were recruited as part of the Shooting Program of the Shooting Sportsmen's Association in partnership with the NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service) and the Shooting Athletes Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick Offley, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Cultural Heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four people selected for the first shooting operation were given extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday in front of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEC).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in the last four years.
Last month, a commission of the presidential apparatus recommended the resignation of the former CEC (Provisional Electoral Commission) as part of a package of measures aimed at preparing the country for the next elections.
Martelli responded with a commission to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Violent protests were also fueled in some cases by the refusal to hold some elections due after 2011.
Approximately 60 malfunctions related to overheating of iPods have been reported, including a total of six fires, of which four people reported minor physical injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reported 27 known accidents involving appliances.
Last week, METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) said it had received an additional 34 complaints from Apple related to cases of excessive overheating, which the company had deemed "non-serious".
The ministry called Apple's delay in the report "unacceptable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m.
No casualties were reported in the country, according to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that no signs of a tsunami were observed.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, Philippines, and detained them.
Rolando Mendoza, shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
To date, several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead.
Six hundred were released, including children and old people like the Filipino photographers.
The elderly woman who needed to use the restroom was replaced by photographers, and Mendoza was shot and disabled.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began working in the healthcare field.
She worked at the Auckland State Hospital for Women in 1959 after completing her midwifery training.
While working at Leckins Hospital, she began to study premature births in her spare time.
His research showed that the process of lung formation in the fetus is accelerated when the hormone is administered.
Xinhua reported that state investigators were able to recover two "black boxes" containing flight logs from the plane on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also remembered Luna.
"Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, and she died on the night of her second month, and her death was as unique as her death, and she was a strong woman", added Tommy Drimer.
Dustin "Goldast" Rannels said, "Luna was as extraordinary as I am... almost more so than I am... and I love her and I'll miss her... and I hope she's in a better place".
In the 2010 federal election, out of 1,400 people who took part in a pre-election poll, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic under the rule of Queen Elizabeth II.
The number of those who wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen was 34 percent, according to the poll.
The latest poll shows that 29% of respondents believe Australia will become a republic, and 31% believe it will never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim 100 to 200 metres in freestyle and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints were considered questionable in light of her health.
He's banned from the games, so he can't take the pain medication.
The largest number ever known was discovered on January 25, by Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri.
The discovery, which several people had confirmed using different hardware and software as of early February, was announced on Tuesday.
It is thought that the tail stars are the source of water, along with the organic matter that can create protein and support life.
Scientists are trying to understand how the planets, especially the comets, formed because they collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, who took office as governor earlier this year, last month passed a bill allowing same-sex marriage.
He called all such rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There are rumors that he will run for president in the 2016 election.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system will save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions by allowing planes to fly on shorter routes.
This is done using satellite-based technology instead of the older, terrestrial radio-location technology, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of the aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional cars are allowed to be parked, the overground trains will continue on their way without stopping at Wembley, there are no car parks, parking lots and commuters on the road.
The fear of not having transportation made it more likely that the match would be played indoors, without team fans.
The journal Science published a new study on Thursday about the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States reported that the new species had become globalised in just two generations, but this period is thought to be longer than the formation of a breeding-propagated endemic "Darwin's alga", "Geospiza unicorn", migratory cactus bilbites and "Geospiza mosses".
Gold can be cast into any shape, it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be twisted into thin wire that can bend and twist, beaten with a hammer and twisted into sheets.
It can be made very delicately, glued onto other metals, or even so delicately that it can be used to decorate the hand-drawn illustrations of books, sometimes called "illuminated manuscripts".
And these are chemicals called pH, and you can use black cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The acidity or alkalinity of the chemical changes the color of the water.
The pH level of the chemicals under analysis is determined by the amount of Hydrogen (H) ions (pH in H) they contain.
Protons separated from their electrons are considered hydrogen ions, because hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron.
After mixing the two dry powders together, wet your hands slightly and make a ball of this mixture.
Your hands will be affected by the moisture on the outer layers, which can cause a feeling of tightness in your hands, and a kind of crust.
Faucet toilets connected to a complex sewer system are a characteristic feature of almost all houses in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.
In Greece, the remains of a sewage system were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Iran, and China, they had toilets, and in Roman civilization, they were part of the public baths, where men and women sometimes went together, mixed.
You can use a satellite to call someone thousands of miles away.
A satellite sent into space reflects back the signal as soon as it receives it.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and because the Earth's atmosphere partially obscures its light and image, scientists use telescopes in space.
A satellite or telescope can be launched into space with only a large rocket, 100 feet long.
The greatest achievement of the wheel, which has changed the world dramatically, is that it has made transportation easier and faster.
Thanks to this invention, we have the train, the automobile, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are the larger cats, which feed on medium-sized animals such as rabbits, antelopes, and alligators.
Finally, small cats (including comfortable domestic cats) have a large number of prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is based on the concept of a board of unique expressions, each cat having a special job to do.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in packs called prides.
The pride consists of up to thirty lionesses and cubs, as well as one to three adult lions.
Female lions are usually very close-knit, like a big family of daughters and sisters.
Lion prides behave like a monster or a pack of dogs, which are surprisingly similar to themselves in behavior (not to other large felines) and are a deadly predator for their prey.
As an athlete with good elasticity, the tiger has the ability to climb (at a medium level), swim, jump long distances and lift 5 times more than a strong person.
Tigers (of the Panther genus) are in the same group as lions, beavers, and jaguars, and cats are the only four animals that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the sweet, hoarse roar of a tiger, but is more like a crunching, chirping sound.
The oselot feeds on small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the oselot hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that oselots find and track their prey by sniffing its location.
Oselots have excellent night vision, and they can see in the dark, and they also move stealthily, blending in with their prey and hunting them at the first opportunity.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) leaves the population to which they belong, they fall into a different environment from the one they previously lived in (for example, if they are taken to the other side of a mountain or river, or to a new island, they cannot easily return).
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different characteristics and adaptations to be a stronger competitor than its previous form.
The initial population has not changed at all, and they still need the same adaptations.
As the newly settled population gradually begins to adapt to the environment, they become less like the others.
And the result is that in thousands or even millions of years, the two species will look very different from what they do today, and they may not even be the same species.
We call this process species formation, which is the formation of new species, and it's an inevitable result and a very important part of the process of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans need to breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide as they exhale.
Plants grow by photosynthesizing with the sun, and they also cast shadows.
We use plants to build our homes and make our clothes, plants make up most of the food we eat, and animals could not live without plants.
Mosasaurus was the most savage of its time, and it was not afraid of anything except its closest relatives, the mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 sharp teeth, with an extra set on its upper jaw, meaning that nothing could escape its grasp alive.
We certainly think it had a tongue shaped like a hook, but we don't know for sure, and we think it ate turtles and big fish and other mosaic animals, and we think it was probably a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like the Treks couldn't compete with it.
Although we know most of their food, the Romans have a variety of banquet dishes, such as wild boar, turkey, water lilies, and the cutting type, the sulese.
Another difference was that while the poor and a woman sat at the table and ate, the rich people had feasts together and ate their meals lying on their sides.
In the following centuries, the dishes that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia were not included in ancient Roman cuisine.
So they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, the main temple being considered the house of that god.
While the monks tried to satisfy the gods' demands with ceremonies and festivals, the people offered sacrifices to their gods.
Each of the temples has a cloister and a sacristy, which only monks can enter.
Special ehrami-like towers, sometimes called zikkurats, were built as part of temples.
The highest part of the tower was dedicated to the worship of the god alone.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home didn't matter so much.
Outdoor living was often the way of life for Hebrew families.
The women cooked in their courtyards, the shops were open-air stalls facing the street, and the stones were used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was not extensively forested, so timber was an extremely expensive commodity.
Greenland is sparsely populated, and Norse legends tell of Erik the Red, who, while exiled from Iceland for murder, made his way west, where he discovered Greenland and named it.
But the Eskimos were already living there at the time, regardless of his discovery.
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are "Scandinavian" countries, but there are many differences between their peoples, kings, customs, and history.
If you think that the Treasury map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, you've seen the movie "National Treasure".
However, that's not true, because what's written on the back of the document is not a burial plot.
The back of the Declaration of Independence document is inscribed, in an upside-down form, "Original of the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776".
Although the author of this document - a large parchment paper folded for safekeeping - is unknown, it is known that it was written early in his life.
So the notation was probably just added as a label.
Although the north of France had been cleared of enemy captivity by the Normandy landings and the ongoing fighting, the south was still deprived of freedom.
It was ruled by the French, called "the Vichy", who signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940, and these French people cooperated rather than fight the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the plan of invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and moved on to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture where a large group of people living and working together share a community.
The word "civilization" means "civil", derived from the Latin civilis, and again "citizen", derived from the Latin civis, "civitas", or "city-state", and it also defines the size of a society in a certain form.
The predecessor of nations were city-states. The culture of civilization considers the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the preservation of cultural traces and the equitable distribution.
Small cultures are often unrecognizable as civilizations because they disappear without leaving any historical evidence of their own.
The Revolutionary War was still underway when, under the Articles of Confederation, the thirteen states united to form a weak central government, the only component of which was the Congress.
Congress, which had no power to impose taxes, relied on government agencies that were not very useful in enforcing all laws, because it had no national executive or judicial power.
Nor does it have the authority to invalidate interstate tax laws and tariffs.
Anonymous consent from all states must be obtained before the amendment to the articles can be implemented, and the states have been so indifferent to the central government that representatives representing them have usually been absent from meetings frequently.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing are among the popular sports.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions of the country, and Italians also participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
The Japanese have about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan is also called an "archipelago" in terms of its geographical position, due to the arrangement and grouping of islands it possesses.
In the 15th century, Taiwan began to be known by these names when European sailors referred to the island as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan by revolutionizing local grain-producing practices, as well as employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), which had conquered the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which confirmed that it had ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, who would retain it until 1945.
It consisted of 3 main monuments, Machu Picchu, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings surrounding the complex have been subject to reconstruction work in order to give tourists an impression of what the originals actually looked like.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored, and reconstruction work is still going on.
For example, the most common still-used photographic format in the world is 35 mm film, which was the most commonly used film size in the late analogue film era.
It's still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is used in the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format sounds a bit confusing, but it's actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
For this reason, the ratio of sides (divided into twelve to achieve simplest completeness) of this format is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats is an example) have this latitude-to-height ratio, or are close to it.
The most abused and often mocked rule of the triads is a simple rule that creates dynamism by maintaining a certain sequence of stages in a picture.
It states that the most efficient location for the main object is at the intersection of the lines dividing the figure into three places in the vertical and horizontal directions (see example).
It was at this time in European history that the Catholic Church, having become stronger and wealthier, came under the control of the state.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together despite their differences in religion, language, and traditions.
And he brought the king and all the people under his dominion, and the power that was above all.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity was that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds deposited in the church should serve only this purpose.
The centrality of the church's authority had been in Rome for thousands of years, and the concentration of power and financial resources in such a place raised questions about the fulfillment of this principle.
Soon after the British began their military campaign, they laid siege to Germany by sea.
Although this blockade violated generally accepted norms of international law, which had been regulated by several international treaties of the previous two centuries, the strategy had its effect by cutting vital military and civilian supplies.
To prevent any vessel from entering all parts of the ocean, Britain did not hesitate to put even ordinary ships in danger and to mine international waters.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the main attitude of many citizens and peoples was one of pacifism and non-isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations never want to face such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had only four cents, a set of poems, and a letter of recommendation from his former employer, Charles Batchelor, for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China displayed its different time zones in a unique way, and each stage of China, or each ruling family, was from a unique dynasty.
Also, between the dynasties, the fragmented provinces had different periods, the best known of which is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years with tensions between the Han and Qin dynasties.
During this time, there were fierce battles between the Ayan contending for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in a battle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
Many of the social and political influences that have been present include the use of the metric system, the transition from monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates who were most ambitious and ready to succeed.
The same could be said for the army, because the army rank was determined by caliber, not class.
The French Revolution inspired the working class, which had been repressed by other countries, to start revolutions as well.
Muhammad was also deeply interested in non-worldly matters, and he would often go to the cave called "Hira" on Mount Nur to meditate.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, provides a very clear picture of the spiritual appeal of the Prophet Muhammad.
Completely isolated from the rest of the world, this cave is located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca.
In fact, even if it's known to exist, it's hard to find, and to go inside a cave is to be completely isolated.
When you look up, you can see nothing but a clear and beautiful sky and the mountains that surround it, and it's very difficult to feel the world from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is just one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that has survived to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramids built to perpetuate the memory of the deceased Pharaoh.
As Europe emerged from the Middle Ages, the amalgamation of the Choral (later called Gregorian Choral) of the Roman Catholic community and the liturgical rites led to the development of a type of music that later spread throughout Europe through the papacy and monasteries for both female and male singing.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while the smaller pyramids around it, tombs, and most of the temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "top curve" sign resembles a V, while the "bottom curve" sign resembles a shortcut or a reversed square.
When you say "top", you have to start from the top and pull the bow downwards, and when you say "bottom", you have to start from the side of the violin (where you hold the bow in your hand) and pull the bow towards yourself.
The upper string usually produces softer sounds, while the lower string produces louder, more determined sounds.
Feel free to make your own markings with the pen, but the hammer marks given in print indicate any detail in the music, so they should be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two minor children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market women.
They were back in Paris in a carriage, looking at the king and queen, among a crowd of people shouting their hatred, threatening them.
Because of the crowd, the King and Queen had to open the car windows wide.
At this point, a member of the crowd waves the head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war costs incurred by US imperialism during the occupation of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people.
They had to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to cover a large part of the costs and the variable bond interest through branches of the Wall Street bank on behalf of the Philippine government.
Certainly, the Philippines had made enough profit from their long exploitation of the people to be the main gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Tampliers requires an understanding of the context that prompted the ordering of the creation.
The 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, when the events took place, are known as the Early Middle Ages (CE 1000-1300).
The Early Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages, which lasted for 1,500 years.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the attempt to advance technology, or necessity, to a certain way of thinking that human destiny is guided by a basic logic of scientific rights and their implication in technology.
Most of the explanations for technological determinism are based on two general ideas: that technological development itself advances in a broader way than large-scale cultural or political influence, and that technology is not socially conditioned but "influences" a particular society.
For example, motorized vehicles have played a leading role in the development of roads.
Despite all this, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed that can reduce the cost of owning a car.
The fact that the majority of the masses own cars is not only causing an increase in road accidents, but also the invention of new technologies in the healthcare field to treat the physical injuries in accidents.
Romanticism has a great element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fixte and Schlegel.
Associated with Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography shaped customs and cultures that were better suited to society than arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris was the fashion capital of the modern world.
It became known as the center of literature from about 400 C.E. and retained that status until about 1100 C.E.
In the twelfth century, it gradually began to lose its status, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with more valuable goods than those available in the Byzantine markets, such as silk and spices.
It was at this time that Constantinople's title of "Capital of Fashion" was transferred to Paris.
In the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century, the Gothic style reached its peak.
First, the Byzantine culture of the east had influenced the dress.
However, because of the poor communication channels, western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
Western Europe began to improve its way of life in the late Middle Ages, and one of the great innovations of the period was the use of buttons to tie clothes, which was a result of the Crusades.
Family farming is a type of farming that is concerned with producing enough food to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
In family farming, farming is a system that uses easy, organic, alternating cropping cycles combined with ecoregionally-conserved seed crops or relatively simple techniques to increase crop yields.
Historically, many farmers were family farmers, and this is still the case in most developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated by societal norms, and cause them to form a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of the members are factors that differentiate subcultures.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be considered as language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture display a characteristic and symbolic use of style, whose membership usually involves fashion, gestures, and archaism.
Reflecting on some of the sad stories of children who grew up neglected, unhappy, or abused and were not socially ostracized by adults as they grew up is one of the most widely used ways to express the importance of socialization.
Some of these children are confined to the home by humans (usually their own parents), and in some cases, their parents discard them because they reject the child's violent mental or physical defects.
Wild children may have been abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, some of which spontaneously survive in the wild.
A feral child, raised entirely without humans and by animals, will show his fear of, or indifference to, humans by virtually imitating the actions of the animal that raised him (within physical limits).
While the learning process is geared towards making project-based learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method takes it to entirely new levels.
Temporary devices are more than a teaching method, they are a tool for students who are using new learning methods, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Temporary devices become virtual and real, so the teacher is a temporary device, but so is the little flag man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual temporary devices are built into the software and are designed to ask questions related to procedures that the student may have difficulty with, get quick answers, and explain the procedures.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, cruelty, and even abuse.
How many children grow up without having to grow up in an environment where there is no one to nurture, care for, train, and educate them?
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Providing a safe home, a caring caregiver, a stable education, and reliable health care are essential in the foster family system.
All the needs of the children that are not met in the home from which they are removed should be met in the foster family.
The Internet incorporates elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The different features of the Internet add value in terms of usage and enjoyment.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important types of motivation for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord (1998), who investigated the attitudes of the masses towards websites, identified "individual participation" and "persistent relationships" as new motivating factors.
The use of video recordings, micro-expressions that last a few milliseconds, has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of facial movements.
In particular, it was claimed that by interpreting micro-statements appropriately, it could be seen whether someone was lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks writes that even if people with brain trauma do not understand the speech, they can still correctly assess the sincerity of the speech.
He claimed that even some animals, such as domestic dogs, possessed this ability to interpret human behavior.
Twentieth-century research has shown that genetic diversity has two bases, implicit and explicit.
Mutation creates new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the range of variants that have been expressed.
The separation and reunion blends back and forth between the variations of the two groups from each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human would have a hard time meeting its needs for ammunition from the plants there.
Failure to do so can even lead to serious consequences, such as growth depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources may be proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are foods that can be difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal feed (shells, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides high amounts of protein with all the amino acids your body needs in its composition.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" much like the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
A REM sleep is a process of suddenly waking up while asleep and falling back to sleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily implemented by using a relatively quieter bell clock to simply restore consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you turn off your alarm clock while you are asleep and then fall back asleep, putting it away from your bed will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices include consuming excessive amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, or a urine-thinner you know) before bedtime and urinating frequently.
The level of inner calmness of a person is inversely proportional to the level of tension in that person's body and soul.
Where there is less tension, there is more love of life, and the desire to achieve a sense of complete ease and contentment is common to all humans.
Everyone can be educated, and the only thing that stops us from achieving that is our own tension and our own apathy.
The Buddhist faith of the Tibetans refers to the teachings of the Buddha, but Mahayana has been made more inclusive with the path of love and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, which is the path of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and love, is very simple in principle.
Kundalini energy (thought enlightenment) is awakened through Kundalini Yoga, yoga movements such as breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The Divine Yoga stands at the center of Tibetan meditation, where images of various celestial beings are shown to purify energy channels and activate chakras, awakening the enlightened consciousness.
Germany, which had caused the USSR and the United States to act together in World War II, was a common enemy. With the end of the war, systemic, process, and cultural clashes caused the countries to separate.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
The Cold War, with its truly authoritarian "armies", continued for the next 40 years in all the war zones from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
After the Polish defences were broken on September 17, 1939, the only hope left was to retreat and reorganize under the shadow of Romania.
However, these plans were thwarted overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland's eastern regions, breaking the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements signed both bilaterally and multilaterally, and then moving into Belarus and Ukraine to establish fronts there.
The most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans was to use cargo ships.
Traditionally, the job of navies has been to protect your country's ability to transport its own people and goods, while also interfering with the enemy's ability to transport its own people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II is one of the most notable examples of this in recent times, as the Americans attempted to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to prevent this move, mainly by using U-boats.
Germany could only conquer Britain like the rest of Europe if the Allies were defeated in the fight.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
In ancient cultures, tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats, which are usually joined to flocks that roam on hills or other pastures, are tended by goat herders, who are more like shepherds but usually have children and upgrades.
Carriage roads were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted only of wooden supports parallel to each other, they allowed the horses to pull them along with their heavy loads to increase their speed on the more difficult roads.
Although the rails were introduced early enough to hold sections of the railway track in place, it was thought that these tracks would be more convenient if they were eventually topped with iron.
This became a widespread practice, but wagons with iron undercarriage were more easily worn with wooden wheels.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by steel wheels, and the first all-steel rails were put on the market in 1767.
Humans started walking about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus, and with that, the first known means of transportation was walking.
The habit of walking upright was not present in the ancestors of the Australopithecus.
Signs of bipedalism were found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, however, it should be noted that seven million years ago, Sahelanthropes could also walk on two legs.
We can take the first step by being more environmentally friendly, by joining environmental movements, and even by becoming activists to prevent some degree of future damage to nature.
In most cases, it's like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want to just temporarily fix problems, we need to identify and neutralize the root cause.
It's clear that the advances in science and technology have made the world a different place, and the overpopulation and the interest in extroverted lifestyles have led to more problems.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, the manuscript of the law, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary General Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's cabin a few blocks away.
In one night, 150 to 200 copies of the document, known as the "Dunlap broadsides", were produced.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
George Washington read the copy sent to him on July 6 to his troops in New York City on July 9, and the other copy arrived in London on August 10.
As we know, the 25 posters of Dunlap that have survived to this day are the oldest extant copies of the document, and the original handwritten copy is no longer extant.
In the modern world, most paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive, and we call them birds.
And the reason why a lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs is because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still have many of the traits of dinosaurs.
With legs with hook-like skin and claws, these birds can lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like tyrannosaur rex.
The manipulation of binary-coded data is the principle of operation of almost all computers in use today.
A binary number has only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer language.
Internal toxicity may not manifest itself quickly, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that it is not always possible to make an accurate diagnosis.
The fact that the container of the drug is left open or the presence of toxic household products with chemical components is the best indicator of internal intoxication.
Read the leaflet that lists emergency medical instructions for this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term insect in a general sense for insects in this group.
The term comes from the fact that we've known for a long time that plankton can live as parasites in the human body.
Both leeches and tapeworms are dangerous, capable of living in the nest or in the home of the host organism.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States, indicating that it is seen as a major neurological disease, mostly in young to middle-aged patients.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the skull-brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may feel that raising children is contrary to their own interests or to those of their children.
These couples may make plans to adopt a baby.
In the process of adoption, the child's biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other family can be the child's parent.
The main purpose of science is to study how the world works in a scientific way, and in fact, the scientific way is the foundation of a lot of scientific research.
However, in reality, it's not just an experiment, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations is part of scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers studied the classics, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were adopted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As the level of Greek language acquisition declined, the West gradually began to uproot Greek philosophy and science.
Rhythms that are largely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation by the biological clock are more common in physiology and behavior.
Regular rhythms, not simply generated by reacting to external regular signals, are designed for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and even animals.
Oscillators that can continue to freely cycle and self-regulate without external influence are called biological clocks.
The idea that DNA is genetic material was one of the main ideas advanced by the Hersh and Chace experiment.
Hershy and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
To do two experiments, they labeled the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus and the proteins in the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can affect different forms depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material infected, and whether the infected cell is a germ cell.
Mutations that can be passed on to children when the seed is only in the cell can cause cell death or cancer when they are elsewhere.
Tourism trips organized in the shelter of nature attract more attention from people interested in exploring natural places to enjoy the scenery, including plants, animals and wildlife.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and hiking in parks, as well as learning about the ecosystem, can be examples of on-site activities.
The Alliance, Mu Chang, the Queen, the Stark In, the invaders, the Bornean orangutans, the
People leave their small towns every morning to go to work in their cars, and along the way, people with jobs pass them on their way.
In this dynamic route scheme, it is connected to and supports a system that is based on personal transportation in every form.
Science shows that massive carbon economies have taken the biosphere out of the steady state that has supported human evolution over the last two years.
And while everyone in the community uses public transportation, almost everyone complains about public transportation.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or the flying of bridges.
Why do transportation systems complain so much, why do they have problems every day, are the engineers of the transportation system incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Road traffic is the analysis of the movements of drivers individually and of vehicles between two points and the interactive relationship they create with each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study traffic because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers typically exhibit fairly logical behavior, so that motion flows can usually fit within a certain logical framework and can even be represented mathematically approximately.
In order to better express the traffic movement, a relationship has been established between three main characters, namely (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design, and implementation of highways.
The first animals to take to the air, insects' ability to fly allowed them to escape their predators, find food, and mate more efficiently.
Many insects have the ability to fold their wings together.
These features give them a wide variety of small places where they can protect themselves from predators.
Now, there are only two insects that can't fold their wings back, and one of them is the jellyfish, and the other is the water fly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
While some thought he was right, most people believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun itself (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
Since the earth is not felt to be moving, that idea seems logical, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the largest river on Earth and the second longest river, with a volume of water eight times greater than the second river due to its size.
The largest river on Earth, the Amazon, is six miles wide in some places.
The Amazon accounts for 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers to the oceans.
The main Amazon River, which collects water from thousands of smaller streams, is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long.
Although the construction of the stone pyramid continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were unsurpassed in terms of size and technical perfection of their construction.
The new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians was astonished by the monuments of its predecessors, who were then already over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest, least populous, and least independent country in the world.
Italian is the language of law and official communication in the Vatican.
Italian is the language used daily by most of the working people in the province, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
Roman Catholics are citizens of the Vatican.
In nature, people have known since ancient times about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, which are discovered in natural form and can be extracted relatively easily with primitive tools.
Aristotle's theory was that everything was made up of one or more of the four elements: air, water, fire, and earth.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but it assumed that those substances were transformed into new substances to form what we want to see.
Cells are made mostly of a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table of the chemical elements.
Chemical elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
It is also possible to obtain alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms, which make up everything in the universe.
The volume of atoms is so small that if trillions of atoms were put together, they would be as small as a dot at the end of this sentence.
Since its invention, the carnation has become a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods were discovered, the pencil's use declined even more.
People now write their messages on computer screens, and those who burn pencils are becoming part of history.
In this case, we can only guess what the keyboard will be used for after a new invention.
The principle of operation of a nuclear bomb is based on the energy needed to unite a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like driving a heavy truck to a high place, and as the nucleus splits, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have a very strong tendency to decay with little or no impulse, because they have unstable nuclei.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It appears thinner under the dark layers called "Maria" and thicker under the mountainous terrain.
Because the crust is thinner on the surface of the Moon as seen from Earth, there may be more lunar seas there, making it easier for basaltic lavas to rise to the surface.
The main goal of content theories is to determine what motivates people or what makes people talk.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that they retain as they grow older.
These theories look at what drives people to do certain things, and what drives them to do or not do certain things in their environment.
Maslow's Hierarchical Theory of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory are two popular theories from the motivational theories group.
In general, when principals start to head their former colleagues, two types of behavior can manifest themselves: one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or "one of the girls").
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, assessing the quality of work, giving orders, and holding people accountable.
And at the other end of the spectrum, you become this unknown person who thinks that he has to change everything that a group has done and do it all over again.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success of his team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leader and the rest of the team.
In terms of the same quality standards, virtual teams are considered equal to traditional teams, with many subtle differences.
Members of the virtual group are usually used as a point of contact for the physical teams near them.
Because their teams can meet in different time zones that are not clear to the local management system, they have more autonomy than a traditional team member.
One of the indispensable parts of a virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The "Invisible Team", to which each member reports, is the management group that sets standards for team members.
Why would a company go to all the trouble of being called a learning company, because the only purpose of putting in-house learning concepts into practice is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and mastery can emerge.
As a result, an organizational process that works together to overcome a barrier can be the driving force behind new innovations that meet customer needs.
For an enterprise to be innovative, management must shape a culture of innovation along with knowledge sharing and a culture of learning within the enterprise.
Angell (2006) explains that the Total Environment approach is used as a method to help companies take their work to a higher level.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and therefore shrink the field of study into a more precise form.
Researchers have confirmed the link between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various brain traumas, injuries, fractures, and tumors affect human movement and cause changes in some brain functions.
With the development of new technologies, it is possible to observe and study brain shapes and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to form imitation patterns that make it easier for us to understand the stages of our mind.
While AI has strong science fiction connotations, it also reveals a very important branch of computer science that deals with the adaptation of behavior, learning, and intelligence in machines.
AI research is about creating techniques for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to check, plan and program, respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
And these kinds of topics have given rise to a variety of disciplines that deal with real-life problem solving.
Because they are installed in software compatible with several home computers and video games, they are often used in fields beyond AI systems, such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a big part of any curriculum, and in many cases, teachers like to take their students on field trips to places where bus travel is not possible.
With the virtual travel solution that technology offers, students can sit in class and look at the exhibits in the museum, or see the aquarium or the amazing art.
It's a great way to share any school field trip virtually, to reflect on that field trip and to share our experiences in future lessons.
The website that students at Bennet High School in North Carolina created about their trip to the state capital is kept as a record, with the old one being updated every year.
Blogs are effective in improving students' writing skills, although students typically begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling skills, having an audience changes this.
Since students are usually the most critical audiences, the writer of the block makes an effort to improve his writing further to avoid being criticized.
In addition, blogging "encourages students to gather more information about the world around them".The desire to capture the reader's attention inspires students to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging fosters a spirit of cooperation among students and encourages them to expand their knowledge beyond what they have learned in school.
Students can use blogs to "strengthen their analytical and critical skills by using them appropriately; to refer frequently to online materials to formulate a position based on the writings of others; and to define their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's bilingual, majestic capital city, Ottawa, is home to many art galleries and museums that showcase its past and present.
The city is home to Niagara Falls to the south and Muskoka and other undiscovered natural beauties to the north.
All of these and more make Ontario perceived by outsiders as exactly the same as the real Canada.
The vast areas to the north are sparsely populated and in some places almost untouched.
The population comparison comes as a surprise to many, since the United States is home to more African Americans than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
If it's wildlife, Madagascar is certainly the largest and the most isolated continent.
Many of the relatively smaller islands are independent or French dependent nations and are famous as luxury beach resorts.
The religion of Islam, brought to these lands by the Arabs, spread as far as the Qumran Islands and Mayotte.
European expansion and colonization began in the 15th century with the discovery by the Portuguese traveler Vasco da Gama of a sea route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers report being married, regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing a ring (not just expensive ones) may also be helpful.
Women need to be aware that cultural diversity can lead to what they call rape, and that's not the same as robbery, gun-raiding, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to put your feet firmly on the ground (whether there are cultural differences or not!).
Founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, the modern city of Casablanca was named Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, who used it as a strategic port city.
The Portuguese destroyed and abandoned Casa Branca after the earthquake of 1755.
Spanish merchants who established trading bases in the city called it Casablanca, the Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar el-Beida.
Casablanca is one of the most attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it is very easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as perfumes, false dishes, leather goods, snacks and various types of decorative items, but all of these are intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern end of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was badly damaged by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which affected many of the city's streets, mostly the city center.
Although Goma is highly reliable, visits to other locations outside Goma must be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing war in North Kivu province.
The city is also a major base for climbing the volcanic mountain Nyiragongo, one of the cheapest ways to observe the Mountain Gorilla in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a vehicle called a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). If you want to go a short distance, the normal (local) price of a taxi is ~500 Congolese Francs.
The word "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for both the exotic and distant lands, due to its relative obscurity.
Today, Timbuktu is considered a poor city, although it has become a tourist attraction due to its popularity and even has an airport.
As a result of the threat of desert sands, it was added to the World Heritage List in 1990 as a monument at risk.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' exclusive program on PBS about the Wonders of the African World.
It is a city that has more of an Arab spirit than an African one, and it is in complete contrast to the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northwest of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each containing a separate wildlife.
It is considered to be one of the most visited attractions in South Africa, as well as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Daily guarding and an entrance fee are required, as is the case with all National Parks in South Africa.
In addition, it may be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to selected parks in South Africa, or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island also gives its name to the area where it is located, and it is a major tourist attraction.
The layout of the buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline can be compared to a charming, glowing histogram emerging from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon beach opposite.
The bulk of Hong Kong Island's urbanization falls in densely reclaimed areas along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists came in, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial history of the region, you can start here.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline towards the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarban Forest, which is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List and is located in the Indian territory, was named Sundarban National Park.
These forests, not just the mangrove swamps, contain some of the last remaining trees of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans, about 1/3 of which is water and wetlands, covers an area of 3850 km2.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 bald eagles.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station on the riverbank throughout the day, but many of them, especially those going east and the Jakar/Bumtang bus, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-regional buses are usually crowded, so it is recommended that you buy your ticket a few days in advance.
In most areas, small Japanese long-distance buses are convenient and reliable.
Getting to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200) by shared taxi is both fast and convenient.
The Bridge over the Oiapoque River is a suspension bridge that crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-George-de-l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The bridge is 378 meters long, 3.50 meters wide, with two lanes of road, located between two towers at a height of 83 meters.
The vertical gap under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft) wide, and although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be commissioned in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
The Guaran√≠ were the most important indigenous group, engaged in family-agricultural activities, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes in what is now Eastern Praguay.
Other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Quaycuru and Payaqua, who settled in the Chaco region, were engaged in hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", Paraguay was founded in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadors who confronted indigenous people.
The Spanish colonial period lasted three centuries.
Paraguay was able to preserve its national characteristics and identity after the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537.
The world's best polo teams and players are one of the factors that make Argentina famous.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields of Las Ca√±itas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can be found here.
To find out where you can buy tickets to tournaments and polo games, see Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged in the islands at the bank located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
In general, Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are accepted anywhere in the islands, along with British pounds.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on remote islands, but British and US currencies may be accepted, so check with the entrepreneurs beforehand which payment system is used in the country you are going to.
Since it is almost impossible to exchange the currency used in the Falkland Islands outside the islands, change the money before leaving the islands.
When it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo, which is south of the equator, and vice versa, when it's summer there, it's winter here.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate zone, and in the summer months the temperature usually exceeds +30¬∞C.
If the temperature drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes you feel colder than the thermometer indicates, this or similar cases indicate that the winter chill is deceptive.
There are no specific seasonal concepts of "rainy" and "dry" because the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing people, but nature is still wild, so you can't go near them to feed or disturb them.
The park's warning is to stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wildlife!
Bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can go on the offensive, no matter how obedient they may appear.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping a certain distance, and given the size, the wildness and the potential danger of these animals, it is imperative that we keep a distance between them.
Also, bear in mind that bears and other wildlife have well-developed sense of smell, so avoid transporting or cooking food that stinks, and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia, founded in the 1850s, has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was famous for its maritime panic of 1889, when 7 ships from Germany, the United States and England refused to leave.
All ships were sunk, leaving only one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, a peaceful rally organized by the Mau movement in the city resulted in the assassination of its senior leader, Tupua III Tamasese Lealofi.
Because of its location between two harbors, Auckland has many beaches, the most popular of which are in these three areas.
The Pacific North Shore beaches (the "North Harbour") stretch along the coast from Devonport in the south to Long Bay in the north.
Almost all of its sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and pohutukawa trees have created shade areas on most beaches.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located near the port of Waitemata, in the prestigious coastal towns of Mission Bay and in the St. Heliers section of Central Auckland.
There are many shops along the shores of these beaches, which are also popular with families, and it is safe to swim here.
The main local beer, which is uncomplicated, has a pleasant taste and is cooling, is called "Number One".
While there are many French wines you can taste, here you will find more New Zealand and Australian wines.
Drinking local tap water is not dangerous, and bottled water is readily available if you avoid it.
The concept of "flat tea" is foreign to Australians. "Espresso" is a dark black shot coffee, a drink with cream stacked on top of the cappuccino (not topped), and tea is served without milk.
You can find hot chocolate that is true Belgian standards, and while the fruit juices taste great, they're expensive.
They have year-round underwater travel, and injuries from these causes are rare in underwater rocks.
If possible, follow all the rules and pay attention to the signs that indicate safety warnings.
The polar bear occurs near beaches and river basins in the north of the state from October to April 1770, although it may be encountered outside this period.
Although they rarely attack humans, they do have sharks, and most sharks avoid swimming close to humans because they are afraid of them.
Saltwater crocodiles, which do not lead active ocean life, are found mainly in river basins north of Roehampton.
By booking in advance, travelers do not have to worry about accommodations at their destination.
Travel agencies usually contract with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies offer packages that usually include breakfast, transportation to or from the airport, or a combination flight and hotel package.
They may keep your order in force if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
Before you leave the hotel, contact the travel agency for any adjustments or requests.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees camp on site during music festivals, and many rate this as the most important experience.
If you want to experience the excitement up close, then you should come early and book a campsite near the music.
Even if the music stops in the main stages, keep in mind that other parts of the festival may have music until midnight.
At some festivals, special camping areas are allocated for families with small children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, keep an eye on the cabin location, as the icy roads you cross can be quite noisy for sensitive people.
Your time in the city is also included in the St. Petersburg cruise. Tourists traveling by cruise do not require a visa (see terms).
Casinos usually do their best to maximize the time and money that their customers lose, and there are no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
To keep their guests in good spirits and to keep them entertained, they usually offer special food and entertainment.
In some places alcohol is served at home, but drunkenness can impair judgment, and all experienced gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
The possibility of snow, ice, and freezing must be considered by anyone who will be using a car at high latitudes and on mountain passes.
The friction force is weak on icy and snowy roads, so it is not possible to drive the car as on ordinary asphalt.
When a snowstorm occurs, it can snow so much that you could be buried in the snow in a short time.
Your vision may also be impaired by snow, snowdrifts, and the buildup of condensation and ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal for many countries, and traffic moves on most occasions uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Perhaps the most important tourist activity that attracts tourists to Africa is the safari tour.
Especially in the savannah, the popular term safari is used to refer to the journey of people overland to see the amazing wildlife of Africa.
With standard equipment, some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, can be seen well when approaching cars.
Lions, leopards and beavers can sometimes hide themselves, and you can only see them with binoculars.
A safari tour (also called a "nature walk", "safari excursion", or "walk") is a short-distance walking tour of a few hours or a few days.
The 2021 Paralympic Games will be held between 24 August and 5 September, with some events taking place elsewhere in Japan.
