While there appears to be one experimental vaccine capable of reducing Ebola mortality, to date, no suitable drugs have been found to treat the existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in this area, but official studies indicated that the benefit of this cocktail was less than the claimed mortality benefit.
In the PALM trial, the drug ZMapp was used as the control standard, meaning that the scientists set it as the reference and compared the other three treatments against it.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a fully evolved skeletal chain, called "backbone", but possess other features of feathers - such as bulges and microbursts - researchers have concluded that the backbone was likely a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The wing structure suggests they were used not for flight but for thermoregulation or for display.The researchers suggest that although this tail belongs to a young dinosaur the specimen shows adult feathers rather than a chicken tail.
The researchers note that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird feathers and not chicken feathers.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning in a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The Sun was found to operate on the same basic principles as the other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was found to be governed solely by their luminosity and rotation.
Photodynamics and rotation are used together to determine a star's ROSP number, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the star's activity relative to magnetic fluctuations.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made of the Milky Way.
The effect the team sought was due to tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon's pull on Earth causes tides to form, the Milky Way attracts the Milky Way.
Scientists have been able to infer that dark matter affects other dark matter in much the same way that natural matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy lies around it in a halo-like state, being small particles in large numbers.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the disease XDR-TB in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new bacterial variant is "extremely worrying and alarming because of its extremely high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients including two members of staff may have contracted the virus in hospital.
Over the course of a year, an infected person may contract between 10 and 15 different strains of the same virus.
However, the percentage of drug-resistant TB in the total TB population remains low; 6,000 of the 330,000 total people are infected at any given time in South Africa.

The first cases of the disease were reported at the end of August this year.
The disease is transmitted by pigs, which are then transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.
The spread of the epidemic prompted the Indian government to take measures such as deploying pig hunters in the most affected areas as well as distributing thousands of mosquito nets and spraying insecticides.
The government has promised to provide several million doses of the encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to the most affected areas throughout history have been postponed this year due to lack of funding and a lower priority for the disease than for other diseases.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: where voters isolate themselves in a booth, and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box, and signs it on the voter list.
The French electoral law regulates the procedure with unfavourable rigor.
Since 1409, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that no envelopes are present at the start of voting, and that only envelopes of registered voters and duly authorised voters and commissioners are added.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision following a specific procedure.

Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five persons for raping the Swiss woman and have confiscated her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kangar, Botha Kangar, Rambhu Kangar, Gaza Kangar and Vishnu Kangar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
But the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of a red Audi TT.
He had previously been admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
She has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness could be questionable as her photo was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have considered that publication of the images would be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems to me that journalists are certainly heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or other similar material of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service informed the press that there would be no further comment until at least after the indictment.
The document will also, according to the leak, refer to a border dispute, claimed by Palestine based on the pre-war borders of 1387 A.H. in the Middle East.
Other topics that were reported to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem which is an important issue for both peoples and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a ten-year military presence in Gaza, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a five-year presence only.
The rangers had to closely supervise the shooters in the complementary pest control experiment, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were selected for the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick Ahlin, acting director of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage, the four hunters selected for the first hunt had received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday as a new member of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth by-election for Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that had started in the square.
Protests, sometimes violent, broke out over the failure to hold elections scheduled for 1432.
About 60 incidents of iPod overheating malfunctions have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving hardware.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of malfunctions, which the company termed "non-serious".
The Ministry responded to Apple's call for a delayed report as "very unfortunate".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 am local time (Friday at 12:19 am Mecca time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the area.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there were no indications of a tsunami wave potential.
A former Filipino policeman has taken two Hong Kong tourists hostage in a bus hijacking in Manila, Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographer later replaced an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Leggens followed in his father's footsteps and took up medicine as a profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1379.
Leggins began investigating preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His research has shown that when given a hormone it will accelerate lung development in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, or so-called "black boxes", on Wednesday.
I also congratulated my fellow wrestlers on their colours.
"Luna was the first extreme queen", said Tommy Dreamer. "My first mistress, Luna, died on New Moon night. A strong woman, a one-of-a-kind".
Dustin " The Goldfinch " Runnels commented: "Luna was as eccentric as I am... probably more so than I am... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
In a poll of 1,400 people taken before the 1431 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 1429.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 1431 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree with this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Conversely, 29% of those polled thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist's fitness was called into question because of his complaint, as he was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the three heats at the Commonwealth Games.
He could not take pain medication as it is forbidden in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number at 25 decimal places.
Several people checked the discovery using different devices and software as of the beginning of January and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets formed, and especially how the Earth formed after comets smashed into it long ago.
Comey, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumours "political gossip and nonsense".
He is likely to run for president in 1437.
Neoxygen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-linked technology in contrast to older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with higher accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There is no additional transport and no underground trains stop at Wembley, as well as no car parks and no underground parking and boarding facilities.
Concerns over lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of the team's supporters.
I cited a study published Thursday in Science about the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although this process was thought to have taken much longer - due to cross-breeding between a domesticated Darwin's finch, a medium-sized groundhog, a migratory cactus, and a finch with a pointed snout.
Gold can take many shapes. It can be rolled into small squares.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be rolled up and out. It can also be struck or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "luminous manuscripts".
It is called the chemical's H-value number, and you can make an index of this number using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The level of hydrogen acids is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical that is being tested.
Hydrogen ions are electron-deprived protons (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Fold the two dry powders together and shake them with your clean wet hands until they are ball-shaped.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a sort of covering.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had toilets with flush toilets in almost every house coupled with a sophisticated sanitation system.
Remains of sanitary sewer systems have been found in houses in Minoan Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would bathe together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and returns it almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere obscures some of the light and visibility.
It would take a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the face of the world dramatically; but providing a faster and easier means of transport is the single most important contribution it has made to us.
He has provided us with a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
In a lower tier there are more medium-sized cats feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits, deer and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including the house cat) eat smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is a concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Black cats are the most social of the cats and live in large groups called colonies.
A lions family consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
Females tend to be closer to each other, being a larger family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly the animals are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour and are very lethal to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the leopard can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for long distances and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus) as the lion, the leopard, and the uigur. These four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not exactly like a lion's roar, but it is closer to a furious wordy roar.
The pygmy leopard prefers to eat small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the pygmy leopard hunts are smaller in size.
Scientists believe that feral cats track and find prey by smell; they sense where they have been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with their night vision, and they move very stealthily too. Lesser pygmies hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main group of population to which it belongs (for example if it moves across a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment from the one it was previously in.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group will need different characteristics or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than the previous one.
The Aborigines have not been changed at all, so they still need the same methods of adaptation that we have.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, their similarity to other populations gradually diminishes.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will have diverged so much that they cannot be called a single species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.The emergence of a species is seen as a necessary consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The dinosaur was the dominant predator of its age, so it feared nothing, except other dinosaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 claw-like teeth plus another set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything to get in its way.
We do not know for sure, but it is likely that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish and other reptiles, and it was probably carnivorous.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could match it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of exotic or unusual holiday items, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a lycaon.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals seated on benches, the rich men preferred to feast together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
The ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the foods that in later centuries had been brought to Europe from the Americas or from Asia.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods and considered it to be the house of the god.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the gods during festivals and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard leading to a safe enclosure that can only be entered by priests.
Unique pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the gods.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, home was not of great importance.
Most Jewish family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the square; shops were just open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was expensive.
Greenland has been inhabited by humans sporadically. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were living there previously.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though each country was Scandinavian.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated 18 January 1190". The text appears at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although the author of this portion of the text is not precisely known, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 inches √ó 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was originally in a folded state.
So, it is likely that the code was simply added as a label.
The landings on the fateful day and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
France was ruled by the Visigoths. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1359 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 June 1359, the Allies invaded southern France, in what was known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French troops had liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work together as a community.
The word civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means citizen, which is related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, city or city-state, also determined by the mode of social organization.
Autonomous cities are the ancestors of nations. Urban culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, the leaving of cultural imprints and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Microcultures often disappear without leaving any real historical evidence or being recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government - of which Congress was the sole constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to tax, and in the absence of a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were generally uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, it does not have the authority to override interstate tax laws and tariffs.
The articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended and the states mocked the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 1427.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to - from a geographical perspective - as an "archipel".
Taiwan began to be rediscovered in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island as Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1033 AD, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change native grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1094 CE, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1053 CE - 1330 CE) dominated the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and Taiwan was proclaimed a province of the Qing Empire in 1302 CE.
In 1312, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1311-1312, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1364.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana , the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1396 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered and restoration work continues today.
For example, the most common motion picture format in the world is 35 mm, the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
Its production continues to this day, but most importantly the image sensor body of digital cameras has inherited its aspect ratio.
The 35 mm model is a bit confusing actually, it is 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus the ratio of the dimensions of this particular figure (when divided by 12 to get the ratio of the simplest integer) will be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the Advanced Photo System family of formats) have a width-to-height ratio equal to or nearly this.
The oft-misused and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining some degree of systemicity.
Remember that the most prominent place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three vertical and horizontal segments (see illustration).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European countries together for over a millennium despite differences in language and customs.
The overwhelming power he wielded affected everyone from the king to the common people.
A core Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's cash funds exist specifically for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the church in Rome had the central authority, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the requirements of the creed were being met.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to blockade Germany by sea.
The strategy proved effective; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has blocked international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire sections of the ocean, threatening even neutral shipping.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1301 Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's phases or dynasties in power were of a different type.
In addition, there were periods of unstable divided provinces among each ruling dynasty. The most notable of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times a fierce war broke out between various nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, as thousands died fighting for the top positions in the Great Hall of the Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just the ruler.
Also, since the Revolution, the professions have been open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on class, military ranks are now based on rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class sons in other countries to unleash their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent the cave known as Hara on the mountain of light for meditation.
The gar itself, which has survived through the ages, provides a very vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a hill to the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find even if you know it exists. Once you enter a cave, you become completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but a beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era, the Great Pyramid is one of several monumental pyramids built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "City of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), miniature tombs, temples, and a mausoleum.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honour Khufu's wives and other family members.
An upward trend looks like a V and a downward trend looks like a wedge or a square without a bottom.
A high sign indicates that you should start at the edge and push the bow, while a low sign indicates that you should start at the end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it in.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and more dense.
Feel free to draw your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed curved markings are there for a reason, so they should be respected in general.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary-Th√©r√®se aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women on 17 March 1204 A.D.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd shouting and cheering against the King and Queen.
A mob was able to force the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage with their fists.
A member of the gang once brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of a horrified queen.
The Filipino people paid the war expenses of the United States of America's imperialist invasion of the Philippines.
These had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would form the core of the profits of American imperialism.
We must understand the context of the organization's motivation, in order to understand the Templars.
The era in which these events took place is known as the High Middle Ages and covers the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (390-700 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, the latter of which ended in approximately 893 CE.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the drive for technology or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is tied to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Two general ideas are shared by most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path of least cultural or political influence, and that these technologies in turn have "effects" on the communities of which they are a part, rather than being associated with the community.
For example, one might say that the automobile engine necessarily led to the development of the road.
But establishing a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for a handful of cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to an increased rate of road accidents, which leads to the development of new technologies in health care to treat the affected bodies.
Romanticism was a significant element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Weisch and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography developed, and these, as they were harmonized with the social space, were superior to arbitrary rules imposed by society.
Just as Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 493 AD.
Its decline during the 12th century was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were of higher value than those offered by the Byzantine bazaars.
It was at this time that Paris was dubbed the capital of fashion instead of Constantinople.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, patterns in the West may be as late as 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the time was as a result of the Crusades that people started using buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is conducted to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Subsistence farming - often organic - is a simple system that uses stored seeds adapted to the ecosystem of the area, plus a rotational crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques with the goal of increasing yield.
Most farmers have historically worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures reconcile like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, race, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The traits that define a subculture's identity may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership by a diverse and symbolic use of style that includes dress, behavior, and accent.
Among the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by citing a few unfortunate cases of children who experienced neglect, bad luck or intentional harm, and were socially isolated from adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "wildlings" or "crowds". Some lost children have been locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment was due to the parents' refusal to treat the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Abandoned children may have experienced childhood abuse or severe trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been domesticated by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by nonhuman animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that are very similar to those of a pet, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further than that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather a tool that provides support for individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new venture.
Interactive learning can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of interactive learning, much like a Microsoft Office Clipboard.
Interactive learning is supported internally in the programme and aims to ask questions, motivate and explain actions that would be difficult for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not support care and education, but they do.
We recognise that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The surrogate carer must provide all the essentials that were missing in the previously evacuated homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and private communication.
The peculiarities of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and modes of content.
For example, some suggest that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eime and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, i.e. facial movements that last for a fraction of a second.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether someone is lying by interpreting the exact expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks noted in his paper that the President's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
It also suggests that these abilities to analyze human behavior may be shared by some animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research showed two groups of Chinese varieties: a subtle group and a visible group.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the aggregate of expressional variation.
The processes of separation and recombination randomly cause variation to go back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have difficulty meeting their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure to do so will also lead to severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most abundant plant resources were proteins obtained from the leaves and stems, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite and egg) are not only easily digestible, but are high in protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Insomnia is a conscious act of falling asleep during normal sleep and going to sleep after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during sleep, you may want to put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other options, based on biosystems, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his or her body and mind.
The less stress we have, the more positive our life force gives us. Everyone has the inherent potential to find peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing holding us back from this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but developed through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yuga . Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, gratitude is activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but by the end of the war, clashing systems, procedures and cultures led to conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was to last for the next forty years, being fought on the ground, by proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 Ramadan 1358 A.H., the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman Bridge.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army troops entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of cargo ships is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure the ability of your country to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, intercepting the ability of your enemy to transport theirs.
One of the most notable modern examples is the North Atlantic Campaign of the Second World War. where the Americans attempted to transport personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean in aid of the British.
Meanwhile, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have invaded Britain just as it had done with the rest of Europe.
The goat appears to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to be preserved for easy access to milk, wool, meat and leather.
The dairy goats were generally raised in herds roaming the hills or other pastureland, often tended by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known pastoralists. These grazing methods are still in use today.
Coach roads were developed in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to greater speeds and to pull greater loads than on roads which were considered rougher at the time.
Train tracks were invented relatively early on to secure tracks, but it was later found that putting a rail over the track would make it more efficient.
This became the norm, but the iron caused further wear to the wooden carriage wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1181, the first complete iron bars were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation; humans began walking erectly two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (literally "standing man").
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in a stable manner.
Two-legged species were found in the fossil record of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 Ma, although coelacanths may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to end it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed dramatically due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and that problems have become greater due to the increase in population and the opulent lifestyle of man.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary of the Treasury Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printer.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Cash Notes".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on the eighth of Rugby.
One of them was sent to George Washington on the 6th of February, and he read it to his troops in New York on the 9th. A copy arrived in London on the 10th.
The twenty-five Dunlap scrolls represent the earliest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence document, but the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have padded feet, claws, and are white, and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits - or bits, when using a computer's symbolic language.
An emesis may not show symptoms immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as vomiting, which is common enough, appear.
A poisoned medicine or toxic household chemical may be the best indicator of internal poisoning.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
Entomologists use the term "bugs" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to infest humans.
Both bed bugs and killer bugs are named for their longevity, and they have adapted to living in their host's nest or home.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that females are twice as likely as males to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child to raise a child.
Such couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption , the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
They are not, however, unique in this regard; experimentation is testing that can be used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are critically dependent on, and often produced by, the existence of self-cycles in the circadian clock.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclic signals, have been documented for most organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are oscillators that persist for periods of cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first major demonstrations that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses or parasites to introduce their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to label DNA using radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur protein.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells can only be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be to visit, photograph and document the orangutans of Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to their places of work and are met on the way by other workers in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is supported and somewhat connected by a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this carbon-based mega-economy may have displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses public transport. Everyone complains about public transport.
Similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down are rarely heard in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of motorists and individual vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic studies are difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic has a reasonably consistent pattern, which can be expressed mathematically approximately.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships aid in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to bend their wings back along their body length.
This gives them a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are the dragonfly and the Mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right but many people thought otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the Earth including the Sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the ground moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, at times up to 6 miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or architectural excellence.
The ancient Egyptians in the modern kingdom were fascinated by the relics of their ancestors, which are over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most state functionaries, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
The existence of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper has been known since ancient times, as all of these elements are found in nature in their native form and can be extracted in a relatively simple way using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This was analogous to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although it also assumed that they transformed into new materials to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a combination of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are metals such as silver and gold as well.
You can also get alloys that contain trace amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
Then, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the pencil has been relegated to less prominence and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without having to use a keyboard.
One has to wonder what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works by gathering energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. The core breaks down again and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei which means that they tend to decay with little or no movement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the shell is about 70 kilometres on the near side and 100 kilometres on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar oceans on the near side because the crust is less thick. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are about finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that automatically manifest themselves as they reach puberty.
These theories look at what makes some people want to do the things they do and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of contents are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's second factor theory.
In general, stereotyping can appear when managers begin to dominate their former peers in an attempt to remain "the same as the others" (or others).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary action, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, the individual becomes so unrecognizable that he/she feels obliged to change everything the team does and has.
In the end, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to friction between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical colleagues.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members as their teams may congregate according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real "stealth team" was described by Larson and LaFausto, 1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the Invisible Team management team, where the Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to create an educational organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the goals of applying the concepts of institutional learning.
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments in an organization, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
As a result, synergies within the organization to overcome barriers can result in new innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization is able to innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the method of continuity as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The data associated with neuroscience provide concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to knowledge inquiry. They thus narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
He supports the link between neuro-pathology and behavioral scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies is allowing us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in ways we never could before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to construct simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is also a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence involves making machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now being used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been used to build many software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any semester. Often a teacher will want to take her students to places where going by bus is not possible.
Technology enables the solution through virtual field visits. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to review a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year at the Bennett School in North Carolina, students design a website about their trip to the state capitol, and the website is redesigned each year, but old versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience can generally change that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, a blogger will begin to seek to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "compel students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that inspires and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; and by responding effectively to online material, students can identify their own positions within the context of others' writing as well as their own opinions on particular issues" (O'Raveek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital with a collection of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is to the far south, and to the north is the beautifully unspoilt Mascotte Waterfall and Beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as not being considered as inherently Canadian by outsiders.
The larger areas in the north are sparsely populated and some almost uninhabited.
A census comparison that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and is a continent apart when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent states, or linked to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Islam was introduced to the country by the Arabs, and has since spread widely in the Comoros and Maui.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the African coast, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Regardless of actual social status, women travelers should declare that they are married.
It is advisable to wear a ring (but not the expensive-looking one).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they may consider harassment and that it is common to be spotted, held through the arm, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't make it okay!).
The Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids used modern Casablanca as a strategic port called "Nafa" after its foundation by Berber hunters in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1168.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar-ul-Labadia, and Spanish traders named it Casablanca who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods around the Old City, such as chickens, pottery, leather goods, silk and all kinds of cheap goods, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 1423 Goma was devastated by the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo which covered most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside Goma should be sought to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, whereas in Goma it is reasonably safe.
The city also provides a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest trails in Africa for tracking mountain gorillas.
You can ride a Buda Buda (a motorcycle that also functions as a taxi) to get around Goma, and the usual fare (local) is about 500 CFA francs for a short trip.
Besides being relatively inaccessible, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for distant foreign lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, as well as having an airport.
In 1411, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the stations featured by Henry Louis Gates on the PBS series The Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is considered one of the major attractions in South Africa, and its centrepiece is one of South Africa's national parks (South African National Parks).
There is a daily fee for maintenance and access to the park, as there are in all South African national parks.
It may be worth buying a Wild Card, which gives you access to a select group of South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place where many tourists consider their first stop.
The row of buildings that lines the skyline of Hong Kong resembles a glittering graph that appears above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon Waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated heavily on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is where the British colonists took their place, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of coastal mangrove in the world, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located within the Indian Territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just swamps of mangroves; they contain some of the last evidence of the dense forests that once covered the Ganges River valley.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres, of which about a third is covered by water/marsh.
Since 1385, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer roaming the region.
Buses leave from the Inter-District (Across-the-River) terminal during the day, although most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Pomthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the intercity buses are usually full, it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable and powerful Japanese coaches.
Taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around to nearby places, such as Barrow (No. 150) and Ponnacha (No. 200).
The Ouyapouk River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Ouyapouk River connecting the cities of Ouyapouk in Brazil and Saint-Georges-du-Louyapouk in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long, and have two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres . Construction was completed in the spring of 1432 A.H., and it was not opened to traffic until the spring of 1438 A.H.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by Ramadan 1438, at which time it is expected to have its Brazilian customs checkpoints completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, the Guarani lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who subsisted on hunting, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", arose as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 943 A.D., Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournaments of the year are held in the same place, the Polo Grounds in Las Canitas.
Besides that minor leagues and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Argentine polo association .
The official currency of Falkland is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank in Stanley across from West FIC West department store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often used.
In outlying islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance for accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland's currency outside the islands, so you must exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo lies just south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and moisture combine to make the atmosphere colder than the thermometer would indicate.
The amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year, as there are no defined "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards (100 m) from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (25 m) from all other wild animals!
As tame as they may seem, bison, deer, elk, bear, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors a year get injured for not keeping a safe distance. These animals are large, feral, and considered endangered, and therefore must be given their own space.
Also, be careful as the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1350s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1379.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval skirmish in 1306 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were drowned.
During the struggle for independence organized by Mao's movement, a peaceful demonstration in the town resulted in the death of Supreme Leader Tupua Tassi Lilofi III.
Because Auckland is situated between two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor area) beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy allowing for safe swimming, and most are shaded by coconut trees.
Tamaki Road Beaches is located on Whitimata Harbour, on the outskirts of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good selection of shops lining the beach. It is safe to swim.
The main folk beer is known as "Number One", which is not a complex drink, but rather a pleasant and refreshing one. Another local beer is called "Manta".
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines may have a wider distribution.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water, if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is a strange one. A small black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino is a layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent although expensive.
Many excursions to the reef take place throughout the year, and reef injuries are rare for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. It can occasionally be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean; their main habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By making a reservation in advance, the traveler is assured that he will have a place to stay as soon as he reaches his destination.
Although you may find that other forms of accommodation, such as camping, can be booked through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
Travel agents have traditionally offered packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined packages including flights and hotels.
They can also reserve a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any adjustments or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of festival goers choose to camp on site as an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you should arrive early so that you can get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, some sections of the festival may continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are travelling through the northern Baltic in winter, you should check the position of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes a lot of noise for the most vulnerable people.
The Saint Petersburg cruise includes a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually missing, and it may be difficult to find exits.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment, to keep guests happy and to keep them in the building.
Some establishments will serve alcohol for free, but getting drunk hinders good judgment and teaches all good gamblers the importance of keeping a sober mind.
Anyone driving on high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive as smoothly as on smooth pavement.
And during a blizzard, enough snow may fall to make you stop for a very short time.
It may be caused by snowfall, hailstorms, condensation processes or the presence of ice on car windows in limited visibility.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic flows almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safari tours are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most popular with many visitors.
The term safari tour is commonly used to refer to traveling across the country to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, foxes and tigers are sometimes shy and can be seen better with binoculars.
Hiking safaris (also called "jungle walks", "hike-hiking" or "hiking trips") consist of walking for long distances, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 16 to 28 June 1443. Some of the events of the Games will be held in secondary venues in different parts of Japan.
After Tokyo hosted the Olympic Games in 1383, it became the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 1441H before the announcement of the postponement, you may encounter a problem.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late spring 2020, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not been lifted until the spring of 1441, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen while a standard ticket will cost around 7,000 yen.
It helps to dry wet clothes. Many hotels offer a blanket and a table to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no humidifier, or you would rather not wear humidifier socks, then you can try using an air dryer, if available.
Do not overheat the cloth (in the worst case it may shrink or burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some more effective against certain threats.
In some places boiling water for a minute is enough, in other places it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers are likely to encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully infect or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
Shopping in the free market is an opportunity to buy goods duty-free and in designated places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can, in some cases, save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it passes regularly through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow passages and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections  typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is more important.
Strangely enough, mobile service seems to be stronger here than in many other areas along the route, such as the Pennsylvania woods.
German pastry is very good, and in Bavaria it is very rich and varied, similar to the pastry of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are popular with apples being cooked in pies all year round while cherries and plums are appearing during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. A special type of cake is often eaten with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small, rich pastry, try the Berliner, Vancochene or Krapffen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of spices and herbs with meat or vegetables.
Curry spices can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, the use of yogurt in curry is common, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, the use of coconut milk is common.
Indonesian cuisine represents an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of regional cuisines that are common throughout Indonesia, as Indonesia's 17,000 islands to differentiate them.
However, when used without additional terms, the term tends to imply that the food originated in the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simple spicy dishes, the predominant flavors favored by Javanese are peanut, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The knees are supports for the rider's feet that rest on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a horse falls off a horse but its foot gets caught in the bridle, it may be pulled if the horse runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most horses wear riding boots with very tight heels and soft soles.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the back of the passenger to fall off the saddle when pulled back from the passenger seat.

In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking, but you will rarely reach long-distance skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and on well-traveled trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means having to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen Area acts more like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to go through the travel documents checkpoint again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for entry visas for each of the Schengen member states individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
Some tax authorities classify antiques as being goods over a hundred years old, but there is no universal definition of what constitutes an artifact.
The definition varies by geography, as the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Crafts may be recognized as artefacts even though they are more recent than similar goods mass-produced in the distant past.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many other occupations.

You may also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but the advice of those governments is mainly for their own citizens.
To cite one example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advisory is merely a summary of the political situation in a country.
Opinions are often given quickly, generally and simply in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.

Transgender people should not be expected to go through the screening process before surgery while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Drift is the ebb of the tide that cuts through a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Due to the underwater terrain, the backflow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current into the deep water can form there.
Most deaths result from fatigue while trying to swim against the current, which may not be possible.
Once you swim out to sea, the return journey is no less smooth.
Try to aim for a flow again or, depending on your skill and whether someone notices your presence, waiting for a rescue might be another option.
The return trip trauma occurs more quickly than the culture shock (shortening the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Sometimes, travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture have a particularly hard time re-adapting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your familiarity with your home culture.

In general, it is not practical to seek discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian but Russian is widely spoken.
