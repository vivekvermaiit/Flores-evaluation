Not only does it confirm that some dinosaurs had hair, a theory that has long been dismissed, but it also reveals details that fossils cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the coat of the sea otter is chestnut-brown on the upper side and dark brown on the lower side.

Since the dinosaur had no distinctive rachis, or hairline, but had other hairlike features - such as barbs and beards - researchers think that the rachis likely evolved these other features.
The researchers say that even if the tail of a baby dinosaur were to be found in the shell, the sample would show that it was an adult dinosaur's tail and not a bird's.
Researchers say that even if the tail was that of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample suggests that it was the hair of an adult dinosaur and not that of a bird.

In a poll of 1,400 people for the 2010 federal election, the number of people who disagreed with Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
In the 2010 federal election, the incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that she believed that Australia would become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled shared this view, since they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, but 31 percent thought that Australia would never become a republic.

A study distributed Thursday in a journal Science reported the formation of new birds in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the bird's population changed after two generations, although the process took much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be cut into a variety of colors or cut into a variety of designs.
It can be made into aLamber and then rolled and extruded.
It could also be sharpened and cut into metal, or it could be used to decorate illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the chemical's pH. You can create an indicator using the table in the repoIdium.
The repoIon table gives the chlorine content depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level indicates the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons with no surrounding electrons (Hydrogen atoms have a proton and an electron).
The two dry peoples are separated by a river and the five are melted into a hot, moist, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

When you call someone who is far away from us, you use a satellite.
The satellite in the sky receives the call and then redirects it to the receiver.
The satellite was launched by space rockets into the Kuiper belt. Scientists use the Kuiper belt telescope because the atmosphere of the Moon is too hot for the Kuiper belt and our eyes.
A rocket can be launched from a height of 100 feet to carry a satellite or telescope to the Moon.
The world has changed in many ways, but the most important change is the light and hot air.
There were trains, cars, and other means of transportation.
Among them were the best cats, which had the best muscles, such as rabbits, antelopes, and horses.
Later, the larger cats (including the Pusan Bajang) are seen roaming about with their tails, beaks, paws and tails.
Their secret is to know the right place to go so that they can be seen by others.
Lions are the most friendly of cats, joining a small group called a prides.
Pride will be a factor until the oldest of the four adult children is born, along with the mothers of the children and their mothers.
The women were close to each other because of the many family ties between the brothers and their daughters.
The male Lions are also similar to the bear or dog, as are the Ionians (but not as cat-like) in nature, and are equally ferocious to their prey.
Like a trained athlete, the tiger can fly (but not fly) swim, run long distances and can bend at a faster pace than the strongest man.
The tiger is similar to the groups (Genus Panthera) of Iion, Ieopard and the jaguars. These four cats are known to roar.
The tiger's voice is not as sharp as the tiger's when exposed, but it can be heard for a long time.
The ocelots love to eat small animals, and they catch bears, owls, geese, and porpoises when they can, and they are much smaller than most of the animals they ride.
Scientists have speculated that oceIots follow their prey by blowing smoke, tracking where they can get free on the ice.
They have excellent night vision and can call out in the morning, and ocelots also hunt their prey by searching for their nest and then by burying their eggs.
If small populations of living things are isolated from their main group of hosts, (such as on isolated islands or islets or on islands where it is difficult for them to be separated from their hosts), they can adapt to their home environment as they have in the past.
If the home is a different type of home and there are other members, the home group will develop a way to adapt to the new environment and to share in the same way as before.
Those former associates who had not changed much were still in the same situation.
In the course of time, the groups that fit their own characteristics became different from the others.
Until after the passing of the millennium or even millennium, these separate groups differed in their identity and what might be called common grace.
We call this differentiation, which is essentially the merging of two classes. The differentiation is a desired result and an important part of evolution.
Plants give off oxygen for man to breathe in, and man gives off carbon dioxide for the plant to breathe out.
Plants rely on the sun to produce photosynthesis, and flowers provide nutrients.
We make our homes and we sow our seeds and we make our clothes. We say all our food is vegetables. Without vegetables the animals die.
Mosasaurus was the most voracious of all the predators of its time, and it was not afraid of anything, not just of its fellow predators.
Its long jaws are filled with seventy mouthparts, with these other groups in the upper part of its mouth, so that nothing escapes its grasp.
We cannot be sure, but it may be that the tongue is split open. Its diet includes shrimp, large fish, and other reptiles, and it may also eat its own kind.
It also attacks anything that dives into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex would have been able to resist it.
We are familiar with most Roman dishes, but some of the most unusual or unusual dishes were added to festivals, such as pork chops, paboreal, biscuit, and a type of dormouse
Another contrast was that while the poor and the women ate at the table, the rich men preferred to feast together and sit at the table.
Ancient Roman cuisine was not influenced by the food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman could have a pigeon.
The Babylonians built a huge temple for each of their gods and viewed it as a house of the god.
The people bring sacrifices to their gods and the priests satisfy the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a separate courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes temples were built around a special pyramidal structure called a ziggurat.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a home was not essential.
Hebrew families lived mostly outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; stores faced the street; houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was expensive.
Norse mythology relates that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and that on his journey westward, he reached Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever the case, Eskimo tribes were already living in the area at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have vastly different peoples, kings, customs, and histories.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may have thought that the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map on the back.
True, the document has a design on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one can be sure who wrote it, it is known that early on the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was folded for storage.
So the notation was evidently added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France but not the south.
Some Frenchmen had made peace with the Germans in 1940, preferring to cooperate rather than fight.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded northern France in what was called "Operation Dragoon".
The Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France two weeks later, and they advanced into Germany.
A civilization is made up of people who have a culture to help them form a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, in harmony with the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city, which also denotes the size of society.
The culture of one civilization is passed on to another, and this is followed by the generations.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence and without being recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as the sole member under the Articles of Federation.
Congress has no power to impose taxes, and since the country has no unified executive or judicial branch, this is left to the state authorities, who do not cooperate in enforcing the law.
Nor did he have the authority to override the laws of taxation and collection in the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and the states had to rely on the central government for the necessary funds, which were often delayed.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports in the northern region were well-known, including Italian competitors in international events and Olympic events.
Japan has 7,000 islands, the seventh largest in the world!
Japan has been called an "archipelago" because the islands are grouped or clustered
In the 15th century, a European ship to Ilha Formosa, the beautiful island, passed through this island, opening the way to Taiwan.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company based in Taiwan had a sugar plantation and Chinese laborers.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) gained control of the Taiwan Coastal area and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which gave Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three structures, these are Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The typical building on the edge of the canyon has been restored for tourist attractions.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored and is still undergoing restoration.
A photographic film measures 35mm, the same size as analog film.
This is still used today, but its aspect ratio is especially important in the formats inherited from digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm is a very safe size, the 36mm wide and 24mm long.
The aspect ratio of this format is 3:2.
Most formats (such as the APS format) are close to the ratio.
Keep the image in the right size for the right dynamics.
An effective method of cutting an image was to place it on a plate to reduce its size.
In these early European events, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had united the European nations despite their differences in language and culture.
His powerful influence affected everyone from the king down to the common man.
One of the main purposes of Christianity is to use wealth to alleviate suffering and funds have been created for that purpose.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this central source of power and money has caused many to question whether its principles were really practical.
After the war ended, Britain invaded Germany.
The siege was effectively lifted, military aid was cut off and supplies were cut off, although this attack was not officially sanctioned, and was accepted by the international community.
Britain opened up international shipping lanes to allow its ships to enter the entire section of the sea, which was dangerous even to neutral shipping.
Since this tactic had limited response, Germany hoped for a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
Passivity and isolation were the hallmarks of the 1920's.
The horrors and atrocities of World War I were a reality that people never wanted to see repeated.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York city.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
China had a unique time, each family had a dynasty.
Each dynasty had three provinces. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms for 60 years that included the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During this period, the rich contended for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was the longest period of Chinese history, as the majority of the population wanted to sit on the throne in the court of Xian.
The political and social effect was nationalism, the belief that a country belonged to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, men of ambition and success were put in charge of the workforce.
Enlistment was also determined by rank.
The French Revolution inspired revolution in other countries.
Muhammad was interested in the afterlife and often went to the cave called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" to meditate.
He made this cave, and he made it a spiritual home.
This cave is visible from the top of the mountain in Mecca.
It is not easy to find.Go into a cave and feel at peace.
You see nothing but clouds and mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians for Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the great Sphinx.
Pharaoh Khufu and the pyramids, temples, and tombs were built for Khufu's wife and family members.
The "up bow" is shaped like a V, and the "down bow mark" is shaped like a curve.
Start with the tip of the Up and push the bow, turn the bow, press the frog and e-pull the bow.
The up-bow has a soft sound, the down-bow is loud and forceful.
A personal pencil mark can be used, or a printed bowing mark can be used.
In fear, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young sons (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were escorted back to Paris from Versailles by a group of market ladies on October 6, 1789.
As they were returning by boat, the crowd gathered around them shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the car door.
On one occasion, a man cut off the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles in front of a horrified Queen.
The cost of the war that US imperialism has spent on the Philippines is the cost of the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. government to cover the expenses and the interest owed to the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the huge profits from the long occupation of the Philippines have made US imperialism a great fortune.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the reasons for their organization.
The age in which the event took place is known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages gave way to the Early Middle Ages and were succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, reaching their peak around 1500.
The term techonological determinism is broad in its actual application, from the point of view that technology drives everything to the strict assertion that human destiny is driven by a scientific logic and is derived from technology.
Two ideas emerge from most explanations of technological determinism: technology advances along its own path without cultural or political influence, and because of this, technology itself influences people, rather than people driving it.
For example, someone might say that the existence of cars compels him to build roads.
But it would be pointless to spend money on a road across the country for just a few cars, so a new method of making cars was being studied to reduce the cost of those who wanted to own one.
The increased number of people with cars has also led to an increase in the number of road accidents, which has led to the development of new forms of care that can repair the damage done to the body by accidents.
Romanticism played a major role in the culture of determinism, as expressed by writers such as Geothe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes people, and then customs and culture associated with that geography emerge, and since this corresponds to the desires of the community, we are better off following a set of laws.
If Paris is the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was a noted center of luxury that began about 400 A.D. and ended about 1100 A.D.
Its decline during the 12th century was mainly due to the return of merchants with silk and food that was much more expensive than what could be bought in Byzantine markets.
At this time the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Paris to the former Constantinople.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries and again in the 14th century.
Early on, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slowness of communication, the western style may have survived for 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of the Crusades was the introduction of buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture was designed to produce enough food to provide for the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic, approach that uses seeds collected from an ecoregion and mixed with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase production.
At that time, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Cultures bring together people who are often marginalized.
Cultures are distinguished by ethnicity, class, age, location and gender.
Cultures are divided by language, principle, religion, politics, sex, geography and so on.
Members of a culture are identified by their style, fashion, mannerism, and class.
One way that socialization can be applied is by helping children who have been abused, neglected, and uneducated to grow up.
These abandoned children have become violent and aggressive. The abandoned children have been rejected by the community (usually their parents); in some cases, this rejection is due to the parent's refusal to accept the serious intellectual and physical disability.
The abused children were abandoned before they were born.
Some say that they grew up alone and lived with animals.
Because the children who are highly sensitive grow up to be so sensitive that they are very different from normal children.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easy and interesting, scaffolding is much more than that.
Scaffolding is a learning method that helps to develop skills and to complete a project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, as if a teacher were using a microsoft office.
Virtual Scaffolding is a software program designed to ask questions, analyze data, and explain the rules that the student should learn.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including to prevent abuse, neglect, and bullying.
The child must grow up with proper care, medical care, and education.
Foster Care is a safe place for children.
Foster care facilities provide a safe home, loving caregivers, and education and health care.
Foster care provides for all the needs of children.
The Internet has filled the air with elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The Internet has become a popular medium of communication because of its unique features.
For example, "education" and "faith" have been cited as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "close relationships" were identified as new motivations according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they took the opinions of people from websites.
The use of video recording is useful for capturing facial expressions every second.
A person's facial expression can be seen by his clothing.
Oliver Sacks says in "The President's Speech",one of the difficulties he had with speech interpretation was that it was also difficult to tell if someone was being truthful.
He added that a well-trained dog can also interpret human behavior.
The 20th century saw the discovery of two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation is the increase in genetic variation, excluding selection from expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination were inherited from generation to generation.
Outside the savanna, a beetle with a human-like digestive system has difficulty obtaining the amino acids it needs from plants.
But the most serious problems are when depression, malnutrition and death are involved.
Vegetables and leafy vegetables are the most protein-rich plants, but these are difficult to maintain if not cooked.
In other words, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are easily digested and high in protein which they provide containing amino acids.
It would not be surprising if our ancestors were able to solve their protein problem, as did the savannahs.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up during sleep and falling back asleep (about 10-60 minutes).
An alarm clock is a means of alerting a person.
Putting an alarm clock in another room may help a sleeping person to wake up.
Drinking a glass of water or tea before bedtime can help you wake up with a good laugh.
Peace of mind relieves tension in the body and mind.
When stress is gone, life is more positive. Peace and contentment are attained.

Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is influenced by mahayana and the Indian Yoga techniques.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are simple. Kundalini yoga includes meditation and the practice of love.
In Kundalini yoga, breathing exercises, yoga postures and visualization are performed.
The central element of Tibetan meditation is Diety yoga, in which the visualization of the gods purifies the energy, energizes the chakras, and enlightens the mind.
Germany was a great power in World War II, and the USSR and the United States came to its aid. After the war, the country's social and cultural system was disrupted and collapsed.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were at war and the Cold War was in full swing.
Forty years have passed, and wars have spread from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was defeated and the Germans withdrew and allied themselves with the Romans.
This plan was successful because 800,000 Soviet troops invaded Poland, following the signing of the Peace Threaty between Belgium and Poland.
The use of a cargo ship could help to alert people.
The navy's job is to protect people and their property, and also to protect the country from disaster.
America was helping Britain, which was aware of the sea that the North Atlantic used for shipping.
Similarly, the German navy, which used U-boats, tried to block the traffic.
The alliance was unsuccessful, and Britain was in danger of being annexed by Germany, as was the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes have hidden it away to make it easier to use in milk, hair, meat, and hides.
The goats were herded with cattle, mostly young or older, and were herded together, as in the more common pasture system, a system still in use today.
Chariot tracks were developed in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were made of planks, they allowed the horses to move faster and to handle the heavier loads of a paved road.
The crossties were used to keep the tracks from moving, but it was soon discovered that the iron over the tracks was more durable.
Most did, but the iron wheel was more prone to break the boards.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the first cast iron railway was put into service.
The earliest form of transportation was walking, which began to develop two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
The Australopithecus, which they tracked, was not accustomed to walking upright.
Australopithecus fossils indicate that they walked on two legs between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked seven million years earlier.
We can live in a more environmentally conscious way, we can participate in environmental activities, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in any way possible.
But if we are looking for more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the root cause of the problem and then take action.
It seems that mankind's scientific and technological advances have dramatically changed the world, adding to problems caused by overpopulation and climate change.
After this was approved by Congress on July 4, a five-page document signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was taken to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
In one night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which were now called "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon behind Independence Hall on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it aloud to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy was sent to London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are among the oldest known copies of a document, the handwritten copy of which has been lost.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people think that dinosaurs were not dinosaurs because they had hair and could fly.
But we see many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet, they crawl, and they walk with their feet pointing backward like the T-Rex.
Almost all modern computers are based on information encoded in binary code.
A binary number can have only one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, for computer jargon.
Symptoms, such as a cold, are common and may not be immediately diagnosed.
The main indicator of an addiction is the presence of open containers of medication or harmful chemicals.
Read the accompanying instructions for handling the product.
The term 'bug' is the formal term used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the long-standing knowledge that bed-bugs can parasitize humans.
Both the Assasin-bug and the Bed-bug are 'nidicolous' insects, able to live in the nest or in the host itself.
In the United States of America, about 400,000 have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading disease of youth and middle-aged adults
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to research, twice as many women as men have MS.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
A couple may plan to adopt a child for their own benefit.
Adoption removes the birthright from the parents and allows the other spouse to care for the child.
The primary purpose of science is to understand how the world works by means of the scientific method, which, in fact, guides most scientific research.

Biological clocks are self-regulating, which means that they keep going without any interference.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the main suggestions that DNA is inherited.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to make more of their DNA.
They performed two experiments that marked the DNA of a virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of a virus with radioactive sulfur.
The effect of a mutation varies greatly depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the inherited trait, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only variations in germ-line cells are passed on to offspring, but mutations from others can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature based tourism encourages people interested in nature to enjoy nature, including plants and animals.

This shuttle car is nevertheless connected and supported by a transport system based on a private car.
Science has replaced the massive carbon economy that destroyed the biosphere in a stable state that supported human evolution two million years ago.
Everyone cooperates in society and uses the transportation system.
In developed lands, complaints about the quality of water and the damage to bridges are rare.
Why does the transportation system have compains, why don't they do it every day?Can transportation engineers be trusted?Or is there a fundamental cause?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their intersections.
But studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers' behavior is completely unpredictable.
Fortunately, drivers today are more careful, so traffic can be more uneven and can be measured mathematically.
To understand traffic flow, the relationship between these three is established, as follows: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of a road facility.
The insects were first transported by air.The ability to fly helped them to defeat enemies, and they found food and mates easily.

For example, each year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, re-creating the website each year, but not removing the old version to make a scrapbook.
Although students often start their stories with grammatical and spelling errors, their audience can help them to correct them.
Since students often notice mistakes, the blogger works hard to improve his writing so as not to be criticized.
At the same time, blogging "makes students more interested in what is happening in their neighborhood". Because they want to keep their audience watching, it helps students to be intelligent and to make their topic interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging also encourages teamwork, and this helps students to learn beyond the traditional school environment.
Proper use of a blog "allows students to become more active in their research and thinking; by commenting on what they read online, they can express their opinions on what others have written and express their views on a particular topic".
