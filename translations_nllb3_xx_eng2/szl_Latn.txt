USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's list and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by continuing legal changes within our organization rather than by withdrawing the license.
USA Gymnastics supports independent investigation that may shed light on how abuses at the rate so carefully described by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone undetected for so long and supports any meaningful and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowered environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor and then for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also demonstrates features that fossils typically lack, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid colour beneath.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft called the rachis but had another feature of feathers - rays - researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later stage of evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for parade.[citation needed] Researchers have suggested that although this is a juvenile dinosaur's feather, the specimen represents the feathers of an adult creature, not a chick's plumage.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers rather than feathers from a chick.
A car bomb detonated at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, early on Monday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than 20 others.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect it sought to combine was thought to be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in much the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in the form of a halo and is composed of many small molecules.

The government also promised several million vials of the brain stem vaccine, which would help to equip health agencies for a year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to the historically hardest hit areas this year were delayed due to lack of funding and given low priority relative to other diseases.

In France, voting has traditionally been done using advanced technology: the voters isolate themselves in a cabin and put a pre-printed piece of paper marking their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After verifying the identity of the voter by the officials, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law codifies the electoral procedure fairly closely.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can observe that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the count and that no envelopes are added except those of properly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process, and in the evening, votes are tallied by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Adekoya has since been on trial for the murder of his son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but all eyewitness evidence may not be reliable because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary has operated differently, and courts see the publication of the photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that newspapers seem to be following a thin line when they publish photos of suspects etc.
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, indicated to journalists that there would be no further comment until the indictment was filed.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border conflict that Palestine is seeking to reestablish in support of the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel agreed to a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the treaty was signed, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to only five years.
The shooters who took part in the special pest control trial were to be closely supervised by the sentinels as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
A partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. recruited skilled volunteers under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly announced yesterday the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at bringing the country to a new election.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to postpone elections due to be held by 2011.
There have been about 60 reported incidents of iPod overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
In the last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company termed "non-serious".
The Ministry responded by naming Apple's report "the truth value of the complaint".
Landing commenced in the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Response Team said no damage had been reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami warning.
Former Philippine police hold Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly persons, were released early, and the Filipino photographers were released with them.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who needed a toilet, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career as a physician.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, in his spare time, Liggins began researching preterm birth.
His research showed that administering the hormone would speed the maturation of a child's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, the Black Box, from the plane.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of her second moon. She was very unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that Luna was as crazy as I was...maybe even crazier...miss her and will miss her...hopefully in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents shared this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the opposite poles, 29 per cent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 per cent believe Australia should never become a republic.
An Olympic gold medalist had been scheduled to swim the 100 and 200 m freestyle and the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his form was called into question by his complaints.
He was unable to take pain medication as it was banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the finding using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of delivering water to Earth along with organic matter that could make proteins and help sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, since comets have collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, won the governorship earlier this year and signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the clashes as "political nonsense and stupidity".
Rumor has it that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as limit carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately target aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no private transport, there are no overhead trains to Wembley, and there are no surface car parks or park-and-rides.
Concerns about lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be held behind closed doors by fans of the team.
The results, published Thursday in the journal Science, report the emergence of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in just two generations, through reproduction between a Darwinian endemic land snail, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus snail, Geospiza conirostris, although this process was previously thought to have taken much longer.
Gold can be worked into various shapes, and it can be rolled into small molds.
It can be drawn in a thin thread, which can be bent and flattened, and it can be hammered or rolled in a sheet.
It can be made very thin, and can be pasted onto another metal; it can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books, called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is the pH of the chemical.You can make a pH indicator using the juice of the blueberry.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) a given chemical compound is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (because hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together, and then with clean, wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in the markets will react with the outer crust to the pleasant feeling and form a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewerage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would sit together in a mixed society.
When you call someone a thousand miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the compound and bounces it back up into the dish, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways, the biggest thing the wheel has done for us is make transportation much easier and faster.
It has given us the automobile, the car, and many other transportation machines.
Below them are more medium-sized cats, which eat the average prey size, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) which eat much more small prey such as insects, rodents, rats, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, special behavior that each cat performs that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats and live in large groups called herds.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and brothers.
Lion herds function similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals remarkably similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behaviour, and also highly lethal to their victims.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can spin (though not excellently), swim, jump for great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar does not mention the full voice of the lion's roar, but rather a sentence made up of hoarse, carved words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, and when they can, they eat apes, snakes, rodents, and birds, although almost all animals that are preyed upon by an ocelot are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow animals and find them (the victims) by sniffing; sniffing at the ground where these animals have been.
They see very well in the dark due to their night vision and move about in concealment, the ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then attacking the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) remains separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it migrates across a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island and cannot easily get back), it is often in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations than the previous one in order to be strongly competitive.
The original population as a whole has not changed, still needing the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be spoken of as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species, and speciation is a necessary consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that man breathes and absorb the carbon dioxide that man exhausts.
Plants obtain moisture from sunlight through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
Plants are the building blocks of life, and plants are the building blocks of our bodies, and plants are the building blocks of our bodies.
The Mosasaurus was the best flying creature of its time, fearing nothing but other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an extra set of teeth at the top of the jaws, which meant that there was no chance of escape from anything that got in its way.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included crustaceans, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a large dinosaur like T. rex would not have been able to do so.
While most of their food is familiar to us, Romans also ate strange and unusual things during their festivals, including wild boar, porcupine, snails, and a type of rodent called an ashtray.
Another difference was that while poor people (as well as women) ate their meals sitting at tables, rich men liked to have communal banquets, at which they would lie on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the products that reached Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no ancient Romans ever tried turmeric.
The Babylonians built a central temple to each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People made offerings to the gods, and priests attempted to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple court as well as an inner sanctuary, accessible only to the chaplains.
Sometimes additional pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
At the top of the tower was an extra sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not as important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women were plowing in the square, shops were just open stalls facing the street, and houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extraordinarily expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated; in the Norse sagas, we read that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that as he travelled further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "Treasure of Nations", you might think that the Treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has an inscription on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The reverse of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776", which is the text at the bottom of the document, upside down.
It is not known for certain who wrote it, but it is known that early in its existence this large parchment document (in sheets 29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that this inscription was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was occupied by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together - a community.
The word civilization derives from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, cognate to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also in some ways reflects the size of the society.
City-states are precursors of nations; civilized culture facilitates the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, maintaining a cultural trajectory and meaningful development.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not considered to be true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government with Congress as its only elected body under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, Congress relied on the state governments, which were often unwilling to co-operate and enforce all of its acts.
Nor did it have the power to repeal the interstate tariff and customs duties.
Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, as long as they could be amended, and states treated the central government so disrespectfully that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful national team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, chess, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, where Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because Japan consists of a group of islands, it is often referred to geographically as the Archipelago.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when it was the passing European sailors themselves who recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa", meaning Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the Tuvanese production practices of opium and also employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) gained control of the coastal areas to the west and north of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what these buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues today.
For example, the most commonly used format for still photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film format in the late analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but importantly, its proportions inherited the image-converter formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simple integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many popular formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The often-abused and also often-derided rule of thirds is a simple advice, the use of which creates dynamics while maintaining order in the picture.
According to him, the most efficient location for the main subject of the composition is the location at the intersection of the lines dividing the courtyard into vertical and horizontal terraces (both examples).
Through this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, also became an object of interest.
For over a millennium, Christianity united European countries despite differences in language and customs.
This pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that church funds be set aside specifically for this purpose.
Central authority for the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Immediately after the outbreak of war, Britain launched a naval reconnaissance of Germany.
This strategy has proven effective in cutting off significant military and civilian supplies, although this effort has violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from affecting entire areas of the ocean, which threatened even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, the Germans expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were dominant attitudes among most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he took a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with Thomas Edison's 4 Cents on the Bill, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at the time of the first job).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different periods; each period or ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between the dynastic periods, with the provinces being divided into districts, the most notable of which was the Three Kingdoms period, lasting 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were shadow wars between many of the lords vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for supremacy over the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to any single ruler.
After the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the more ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, since instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the terrestrial realm, and often visited the cave that became known as "Hira" on top of "Noor" (the light) to contemplate.
This cave, which has survived to the present day, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
It is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to locate, even if one knows of its existence; the interior of the cave is completely isolated.
You can see nothing but a clear, beautiful sky above you and many mountains around you, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that has survived to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramids built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "top-down" symbol looks like a V, and the "bottom-up" symbol looks like a staple or square missing the bottom.
Up means you should start at the end and pull the string, and down means you should start at the frog (from where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
A top string typically generates a more mellow sound, while a bottom string generates a louder, more definite sound.
Don't be afraid to write your own characters, but remember that printed barcodes are there for the music, and should usually be respected.
The deposed King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of women from the marketplace to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and shouting threats at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a person in a mood of rage waved to the exiled queen a goat from the royal guard killed at Versailles.
The war costs of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were met by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay tribute to the American colonial regime to cover the greater part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
That the large profits derived from the long exploitation of Filipinos would constitute the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history lasting from the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from those prioritizing technology, being technologically imperative, to the strict assumption that human destiny is driven by logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological developments themselves can be narrowly defined independent of cultural or political influences, and that the effects of technology on societies are heritable rather than socially determined.
For example, one might say that the existence of automobiles led to the development of roads.
However, a state road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership on a mass scale also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques for treating damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from such writers as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography formed individuals, and over time customs and culture associated with it developed, and these, being in accord with their place in society, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
As a result, Paris became known as the capital of the modern world, and Constantinople as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its importance declined over the next 12 centuries, largely as the Crusaders returned with goods such as silk and root that were worth more than what the Byzantine market could offer.
This was the moment when the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The height of Gothic style occurred in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
The early style of dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can remain 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style; one of the major achievements of the time, which arose as a result of the Crusades, was the fastening of the cloak on the knees.
Subsistence farming is farming that is geared to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses fertilized seeds native to a given ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather like-minded units who feel alienated by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ because of age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of members.
The traits that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often display their belonging through the distinctive and symbolic use of a style that incorporates fashion, mannerisms, and vocabulary.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to a few unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, unhappiness, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their development.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild".Some feral children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this rejection has involved the parents rejecting the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Homeless children may have experienced significant violence or traumatic experiences before being rejected by their parents or running away from home.
Others were probably domesticated animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
In the case of total animal upbringing, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the parent that cared for it, such as being afraid of or averse to humans.
While the design method of teaching should make learning easier and more interesting, the design method takes it a step further.
Rote learning is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that provides support for individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a rector is a form of scaffolding, much like a little screwdriver in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in software and are intended to ask questions, give advice, and explain procedures that would otherwise be too difficult for a trainee to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to coercion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it is what happens.
We see the flag system as a substitute safety zone for these children.
Our surrogacy system is designed to provide safe homes, adequate care, stable education, and reliable, healthy surrogacy.
The surrogate mother is to provide all the essentials that were missing in the home from which the child was previously raised.
The Internet is composed of mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to extra dimensions in the approach to use and reward.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal commitment" and ""long-term relationship"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the responses of Internet users to online content.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, the movements that make up a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is believed that by properly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a given person is mentally ill.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", observed how people who are unable to understand speech because of a speechless brain are nevertheless able to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination reverse the back-and-forth variation between the two races with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a mammalian primate with a bone system like humans to meet its need for amino acids from available plant resources.
Furthermore, neglecting it has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in the leaves and foliage, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless we are kept busy.
In contrast, animal carcasses (antelopes, termites, eggs) are not only lightweight but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
With all this in mind, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during a normal sleep cycle and going back to sleep a moment later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up at all.
If you happen to move your bedpost in your sleep, you can move it across the room to force yourself to get up from bed to hold it.
Other options based on the biorhythm include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tallow, known diuretics) before sleep, which forces you to stand to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person is given is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force present.Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment; the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but has been expanded upon by the Mahayana way of loving and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
In its basic principles, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of yoga kundalini, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is excited through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods, through visualization of various deities, energy channels are re-twined, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA, and by the end of the war, a clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to a rift between the two.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought in earnest, by replacement armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were broken and the only hope was a Romanian-led retreat and reorganization.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 Red Army troops from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Byelorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Russo-Polish Non-Aggression and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is in fact the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The task of a navy has traditionally been to ensure that your ship retains the ability to move its own men and supplies, while controlling your enemy's ability to move their own men and supplies.
One of the most notable examples was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using most of its U-boats, attempted to stem the tide.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have likely been ready to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
The cig seems to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domesticated chickens were usually kept in flocks that roamed the fields or other pastures, often tended by chicken herders, often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar sheep herder, and these breeding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon bridges consisted only of level wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull larger gaits than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
At an early date, the use of sails to hold the glaze in place was introduced, but gradually it was realised that glazes would be more efficient if there was iron powder on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of wagons to be more heavily used.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones, and the first all-iron glaziers were introduced in 1767.
The earliest known means of transport was walking, and humans began to walk upright around two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "straight man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk in a posture so habitually simplified.
Two-legged specialisations occur in Australopithecine fossils from 4.2-3.9 Ma, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
In many cases, this is simply symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the source of the problem and eliminate it.
Admittedly, the world has changed a lot due to mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have been made worse by human overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After its approval by Congress on July 4, a separate bill signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent several blocks away to Congressman John Dunlap's office.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made per night, known today as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was held on July 8 by John Nixon at Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 broadsides of Dunlap that we know of still exist are the oldest extant copies of the document; the original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today, and they call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and could fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, as computer jargon says.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that a reliable diagnosis cannot be made.
The best contaminant for indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular toxin.
The term "flatworms" is used by entomologists as a formal designation for this group of insects.
These designations derive from their close relationship to beetles, which are insects well adapted to parasitise humans.
Both insects and beetles live in nests and are adapted to life in the nest or in the home of their host.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may feel that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish parental rights so that the other parent can have custody of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
However, this is not experimentation per se, and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, and to conduct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often driven by the presence of endogenous regions and their production by biological glands.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological cigarettes are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a period of free cycling even in the absence of external contaminants.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, i.e., viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments by tagging either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the meaning of the piece of genetic material they affect, and whether the cells they affect are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and it is the nature of cooperation that when there is a majority for the benefit, there will always be more to be gained in the short run by acting selfishly.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplaces are in the same place they left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has ripped the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Almost everyone participates in social life and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Sometimes, traffic flow research is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers tend to behave within a fairly consistent range; therefore, the traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of movement, the relationships between the two main characteristics were established: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These skills assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their talent for flight helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small spaces in which to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are reptiles and amphibians.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought it had a direction, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying over 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes measuring six miles in width.
The Amazon provides 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers to its oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza never equalled them in size and technical perfection of construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the relics of their predecessors, which had been there for well over a thousand years.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state and the least densely populated country in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its official documents and communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most of the people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are of the Roman Catholic faith.
Humans have known of the basic chemical elements - such as gold, silver and copper - since antiquity, since they can all be found in nature in their native form, and are fairly easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, held that all things were composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it referred to the four states of matter's concentration (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also theorized that they change into new substances, thus forming what we see.
Alloys are actually mixtures of two or more metals, and there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals; therefore, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in a dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sometimes, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil was degraded to a lower status and rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without having to go near the hub.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes out.
The fission bomb works by requiring energy to make a nucleus out of many protons and neutrons.
This is reminiscent of the tilting of a heavy weight, and splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to grow with little or no stiffness.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km wide on the near side and 100 km wide on the far side.
It is narrower under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
The closer the side was, the more marrow there might be, since the shell is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to float to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what people are saying or saying to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by their coming of age.
These theories analyze what it is about certain people that makes them want to do the things they do, and what factors in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors may occur when cheaters begin cheating on their former co-workers; one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the dwarves" (or the kids).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, valuing work, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum is the person who transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything that he has done collectively and make it his own.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to friction between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams enforce the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet at different time zones, which may be incomprehensible to local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unusual component of a virtual team.
An "invisible team" is a management team to which each member reports, and the invisible team sets standards for each member.
What should an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating an educational organization?One of the goals of applying the organizational concept to learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently by all functional departments within an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, a process in which an organization collaborates to overcome a failure can lead to a new, innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
To enable an organization to innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby narrowing the field of study and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
Various types of brain injury, trauma, alterations, and tumors have long been known to affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies has allowed us to observe and study brain structures and processes in ways never before possible.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that occur in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important branch of computer science dealing with behaviour, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, scheduling and creating timesheets, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from clients, and to recognize handwriting, voice, and text.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been incorporated into several home computer and video game applications.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom, and often the principal wants to take his students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual trips, where students can visit museum exhibits, visit aquariums, or admire fine art while sitting in a classroom.
Virtual outings are also a great way to reflect on outings and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned each year, but old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students hone their writing skills, and while students often begin their blogging experiences with rough grammar and spelling, audience attendance typically varies.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "compels students to be more aware of the world around them".[35] The need to pique the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "may make students more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can determine their own position in the context of other people's texts, as well as draw their own point of view on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muscat and more.
All of these things and more emphasize that Ontario is considered the quintessential of Canada by an outsider.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, with some of them nearly uninhabited wilderness.
The population comparison is striking: There are more African Americans living in the US than citizens of Canada.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a semi-continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent states or associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was largely adopted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the Inland Sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is required that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what they perceive to be harassment and are less likely to be stalked, framed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be ashamed to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, don't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after a land raid in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city at the expense of Dar l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as jewelry, ceramics, leather goods, shoes, and a whole range of gadgets, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, just east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered much of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be checked to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for exploring the Nyiragongo volcano, with one of the longest mountain gorilla tracks in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma, the normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative unavailability, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its airport and its market make it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to its threat from desert sands.
It was one of the highlights of the PBS special, Henry Louis Gates' Wonder of the African World.
The city contrasts with the rest of the country in having more of an Arab than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa, and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 (19,500 sq mi) and is divided into 14 distinct ecological zones, each supporting a different fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, they charge a daily fee for protection and access to the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider to be their main attraction.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering swamp map, made visible by its presence in Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated in the heavily reclaimed land along the northern coast.
It is a place that British colonists claimed as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal strip of seashores, stretching for 80 km (50 mi) off the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site and part of the forest in India is designated as the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only marine wetlands, but also some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km2, of which about one-third is water/marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and is estimated to be home to 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 packs of Bengal tiger deer.
Buses leave from the Interstate Busway (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a day in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small, comfortable, and powerful Japanese Coaster Buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Poro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 271 feet (83 m), are 1,292 feet (378 m) long, and have two lanes that are each 11 feet (3.50 m) wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian border checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the major indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, living as nomadic hunter-gatherers who also farmed for subsistence.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born from the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted over three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and pits can be seen by themselves at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy polo tickets, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged at one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted at every location on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted at Stanley.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; the owners should be contacted beforehand to confirm that payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months temperatures over +30°C are common.
Winters can be extremely cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the cold feel colder than the thermometer will indicate.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to being seen by humans, they are wild and should not be furred or controlled.
According to the park authorities, there should be 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how aggressive they appear, bison, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of stray animals inflict wounds by not keeping a proper distance, and these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, bear in mind that they attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking smelly food and keep your lager clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval skirmish in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one of the British ships were sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
There are many beaches in Auckland due to its two harbours, with the three most popular being in the three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour district) has Pacific Ocean beaches and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming facilities, and are also provided with shade by the coconut tree.
Almost all beaches are sandy, where it is safe to swim, and most shade is provided by the reef side.
There are also occasional family-friendly beaches with a wide selection of shops along the coastline, and swimming is safe.
These are often busy family beaches with good supply of shops by the sea, and swimming is safe.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a simple beer, but tasty and refreshing, and another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if one is afraid.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign; the short black is "espresso", the cappuccino contains a large amount of cream (not foam), and this is served with milk.
Abel Tasman National Park is located in the Nelson Bays region of New Zealand's South Island, between Golden Bay and Tasman Bay.
Many reef cruises are year-round, and injuries due to any one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, it is still important to follow the advice of the authorities, to adapt to all signs and to pay attention to safety precautions.
Jellyfish have been present near river banks and estuaries from October to April north of 1770, and occasionally can be found beyond these periods.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack humans; most sharks are fearful of humans and shy away from them.
Sun-tailed crocodiles are not active in the ocean, with their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may turn out that other forms of accommodation can be booked through the travel agency, such as a cell phone box.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or look at other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be reported to the travel office, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on the grounds, and most attendees consider this to be a right part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to leave early to get a seat at the convention near the music.
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be parts of the festival that will run late into the night.
Some festivals have special target fields for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes an acute alarm for those most affected.
Trips to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city; cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests; windows and doors are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They typically have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests entertained and in the house.
Some venues offer alcohol at company expense; sobriety is a handicap but the talent of judging situations and all good players know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone who intends to drive a car over high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or adverse temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and cannot be sustained even on a lump of asphalt.
During winter, enough snow may fall to cover you in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or rolling snow or by condensation of water vapor or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, paved and snow-covered roads are the norm in many countries, and road traffic is generally free throughout the year.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in common usage refers to a journey by land to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes timid and are best viewed through a pair of binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "business safari", "wandering safari", or "hiking safari") involves walking for hours or days at a time.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the 1964 Games.
People who booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the cancellation deadline may find themselves in a difficult situation.
Booking referral policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based booking referral policies do not cover July 2020, which was scheduled for the Olympics.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Rocking wet clothes can help them dry out, and many hotels have a toilet and a rocking chair that can be rented even if they are not in the room.
If a toothpick is not available, or if you are carrying a toothpick with a toothpick, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Care should be taken to avoid overheating of the material (which can cause shrinkage and, in extreme cases, cracking).
There are various ways of using water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse cause allergic reactions, spread iodine, or carry infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill humans do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at specified locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a large amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through set-aside forest land.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, use common sense: they carry steep inclines, narrow lanes and sharp corners.
The speed limits imposed are significantly lower than on the earlier and later sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and adherence to them is even more important than in other cases.
Interestingly, cell phone coverage is much better than on many other stretches of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are generally good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is popular, with apples baked in the dough all year round, and cherries and plums appearing in summer.
Almonds, walnuts and other nuts are also added to many German pastries, and popular cakes are often paired with a strong cup of coffee.
If you have a craving for small but rich cookies, try the ones called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with the addition of minced meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland in northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing the huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without special reference, the term typically refers to the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by its simple dishes, which are dominated by ground peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic condiments.
The backrest is the support for the rider's feet, hanging down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the boot, but can be dangerous due to the possibility of the boot's foot getting caught in them.
If the shoe is removed from the horse but its foot gets caught in the stirrups, it may be pulled back if the horse stumbles.
First, most riders wear riding boots with abzash and a slippery, rather gaunt, heel.
Then, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety belts that allow the skin to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling hook.
Cochamo Valley - the main limestone plateau in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its various granite giant walls and towers.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly charting new routes through the walls' infinite potential.
Cross-country sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that rely on skiing down snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to foot.
Skiing is a major destination, and many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", plan entire vacations around skiing at a location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
