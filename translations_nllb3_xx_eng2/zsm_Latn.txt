This not only confirms that certain dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but provides specific details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is light brown on the upper side with the underside being pale or carotenoid-colored.
Studies also provide insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed stem, called a rachis, but had other feather features - spines and barbs - researchers concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development of these other features that came later.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight purposes but rather to control temperature or for display. The researchers suggest that, although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the sample showed feathers belonging to an adult and not a juvenile.
The researchers suggest that, even though it was a juvenile dinosaur, the samples showed adult hair and not the delicate hair of a chick.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey early yesterday killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other victims.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that dark matter throughout the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a polling booth, placing printed sheets of paper showing their preferred candidate into the envelope.
After the officer verifies the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be lit so that voters and observers can see that there are no covers at the start of voting and no covers are inserted except those belonging to voters who are counted and who are authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the afternoon, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following a certain procedure.

He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya is already in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his son.
He's in custody pending charges and trial, but any witness evidence may have been tainted because his photos were publicly released.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but the judicial function in Scotland is different and the courts consider that publication of the photo could lead to prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "Journalists are walking on dangerous roads if they publish photos and other items belonging to suspects".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the entire prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
Based on leaked documents, the document refers to a border dispute claimed by the Palestinians based on borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed while the PA agreed to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control trials should be closely monitored by rangers, while the trials are monitored and evaluated in terms of their effectiveness.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, Acting Director of Park Conversation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission last month recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a move to move the country towards the implementation of new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime riots that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some as recently as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheated malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four people to be left with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they were aware of 27 accidents linked to the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had announced an additional 34 extreme warming events, but the company took it not seriously.
The ministry has responded by calling the delay in the report from Apple "very disappointing".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said that no damage was reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 at the tourist.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographer then took the old lady's place because she needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that if given hormones it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer says "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two months. Pretty unique like her. Powerful woman. "
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented on my weird moon...maybe more...loving her and will miss her...may her soul rest in heaven.
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those in this poll think they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme of the public opinion poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints led many to question her fitness.
He was unable to take the medicine necessary to contain his pain because it had been banned from the Resistance.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri has discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of the water that is delivered to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth forms, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political talk and nonsense".
He is speculated to be the president in 2016.
NextGen is an FAA-mandated system that will allow aircraft to fly to shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology over older technology based on ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately track the location of aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is provided and the overground train will not stop at Wembley, while parking facilities and pick-up and drop-off are not available at the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the games would be held without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports on the formation of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved after only two generations, although this process is believed to have taken longer, due to cross-breeding between a Darwin endemic finch, fortes Geospiza, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wires, which can then be twisted and woven. It can be beaten or milled into sheets.
It can be made so thin that it can be used to decorate books with hand-drawn drawings called manuscripts translated.
This is called chemical pH. You can make a marker using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (letter H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton with an electron removed (since a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Sprinkle both dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, clump the powder into a ball.
The fluid on the hand will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and form a shell-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a toilet in almost every house that is connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and by the time of Roman civilization, they were part of the public bathhouse where men and women mingled freely.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, that means you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space get a call and bounce it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space-based telescopes because Earth's atmosphere interferes with our lighting and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and the greatest contribution it has made to us is making transportation easier and faster.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to vultures and rooks.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral cats) that eat more small prey such as insects, mice, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special task for each cat that prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of cats, and live in large groups called "lion packs".
A pride is made up of one to three adult lions, along with as many as thirty lions and their cubs.
The women were often close to each other, as they were part of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion Prides act much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that exhibit the same behaviour as lions (but not big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Ready to attack, tigers can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, star tigers, and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but rather a rambling, crying word.
The osprey preys on small animals, and will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if it can, and almost anything it hunts is much smaller than its own size.
Scientists believe that the osprey tracks and searches for prey by its sense of smell, which is the smell of the ground it has passed.
The ocelot can see well using night vision, and also moves slowly. The ocelot hunts its prey by hiding in environments that mimic its body color and then poaching its prey.
When small groups of organisms (small populations) become separated from the main population from which they originated (for example if they wander across mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so they cannot relocate easily) they often end up in a different environment than before.
These new environments are resource diverse and competitive, so new populations will need different characteristics or adaptations to become strongly competitive than what they needed before.
The natives haven't changed at all, they still need to adapt just like before.
Over time, as new residents began to adapt to their new surroundings, they began to look less and less like other residents.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they are no longer of the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale and take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (when breathing).
Plants produce food from sunlight through photosynthesis.
We build our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, making it fearless of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are equipped with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set located in its roof, which means there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, and even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't compete with it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or exotic meals, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rat called the dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat their meals while sitting in chairs, the rich people like to have banquets together where they will relax by their side while they eat their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine was unlikely to include foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians had built primary temples for each of their gods that they considered to be the home of the deity.
The people would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to fulfill the gods' needs through various rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctum that was only allowed to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built to be part of such temples.
The tower's top became a sanctuary for the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house is no longer so important.
Most Hebrew family life took place in an open environment.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the store was just an open counter facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was a very expensive resource.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while on his way west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his findings, the Eskimos were already settled there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences in people, kings, culture and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think of a treasure map inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true, and even if there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence is the original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, this large document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it's possible that the notation was added just as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and had chosen to cooperate with the occupiers rather than oppose them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, this attack was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together in a cohesive, community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning public, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas meaning city or town, and it also however defines the size of society.
Cities are the beginning of a nation. Civilized culture signifies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the enduring traces of culture and the equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as perfect civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes and, because there was no national judicial executive, it relied on the power of the states, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
It also has no right to veto interstate tax and tariff laws.
The article required the unanimous consent of all the districts before they could amend and the districts took the central government lightly as their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the winner of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the North, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan contains nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands belonging to the State of Japan, the State of Japan by geographical designation, is usually referred to as an archipelago.
As early as the 15th century, Taiwan was sighted and recorded by European traders who called the island IIha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, creating a transformation in the native grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Empire signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Rooms.
Most of the old buildings have been restored to give tourists an idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu would have been restored and restoration work continues to this day
For example, the most common image in the world's fortography format is 35mm, which corresponds to the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the digital camera image detector format.
The 35mm format is actually, it's a bit confusing, 36mm wide times 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the easiest overall ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. formats from the APS family) are identical or nearly identical to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and disparaged rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining orderly size in the image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines that divide the image into three vertically and transversely (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become enormously wealthy and powerful, began to be questioned.
For over a thousand years Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and official customs.
His absolute power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and misery and that the church's financial endowment is specifically for that cause.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and the power of power and money had caused many to question whether this trust had been fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of the battle, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although these restrictions did not comply with generally accepted international law as embodied by several international treaties two centuries ago.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire section of the ocean, causing danger even to ordinary vessels.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, the Germans expected the same response as that of unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most people and countries was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, some nations wanted to avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his old workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods, each stage of China or each ruling family at the time having its own dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of regional instability and schism. The most notable of these was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period a fierce war broke out between several nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody era in the history of Ancient China thousands of dead fought for the highest seat in the great palace of Xian.
Various social and political effects would exist such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolute to republican rule, and the awareness and spirit of nationalism that the state belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
And, after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants allowing those most ambitious and successful to succeed.
So is the military because instead of ranking soldiers by class, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this ordinary life. He often visited a cave later known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) to think.
He sculpted himself, endured the passage of time, giving a very clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's not really easy to find even if one knows it exists, but once you step into this cave, it's completely silent.
Nothing is seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the mountains around it, and only the whisper of the world is heard or seen from this cave.
The great pyramid at Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, or Nekropolis of Giza in Egypt's Valley of the Dead are several pyramids (among them the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign swipe up is similar to the letter V and swipe down is similar to the shape of a square or an equilateral without the bottom.
Upper means, you should start at the end and push the bow, and lower means, you should start at the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up bow usually produces a soft sound while a down-bow produces a stronger and assertive sound.
Feel free to write your own signs, but be aware that the printed submission signs are there for musical purposes.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Empress Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a group of women in the market.
Riding in a chariot, they returned to Paris and were surrounded by a mob of people shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
A mob has forced the King and Queen to open wide their pedestrian windows.
At one point, a rioter lifted the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the expenses and interest on floating bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the great gains associated with the continued exploitation of the Filipino people would be the fundamental gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that triggered the order's creation.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly known as the High Middle Ages a period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000 -1300)
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas held, from technological progress or technological preference to the strong feeling that human destiny is driven by logic related to scientific laws manifested through technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has an "effect" on existing society, rather than social conditions.
For example, one might say that motor vehicles led to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network was not viable for just a few cars, so new methods of production were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The very high car ownership also resulted in an increase in road accidents that led to the creation of new techniques in health care to restore injured body parts.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and with the passage of time came the customs and cultures associated with this geography, and these, more in harmony with the position of society, were better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris was known as the center of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was considered the center of feudal European fashion.
It was known as a center of luxury starting around 400 AD and lasting until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century mainly due to the Crusaders who returned with gifts such as silk and spices of a higher value than what was offered in the Byzantine market.
At this time the change of title of Fashion Model from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the western style may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the crusades was that people started using buttons to tie clothes.
Self-sustaining agriculture is agriculture that is carried out to produce food for the needs of the farmers and their outlets.
Self-pollination is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds that originate from a single ecological area and are combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in agriculture for a living, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel they are being ignored by society's standards and allow them to develop their own identities.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define different cultural branches may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual politics, geography or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular cultural branch typically display their membership through a particular style symbolically, whether in the form of fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take into account some unfortunate cases of children being neglected, disadvantaged, or abused by deliberately not socializing with adults when they are growing up.
Such children are termed feral or feral. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually the parents themselves); in some cases this child neglect is due to the parents rejecting the severe intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Other children were allegedly raised by animals; some were said to live alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a feral child will exhibit behaviors (in physical limits) almost entirely like the animals that care for it, such as a fearful or indifferent nature towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding provides more than that.
A scaffold is not a means to learning but rather an aid that supports individuals in experiencing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A scaffold can be either virtual or physical, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold and so is the little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffold is integrated into the software and acts to question, assist, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed with foster families for a variety of reasons that include neglect, abuse and even for extortion purposes.
No child should grow up in a careless environment, cared for and educated, but they do.
We see the Maintenance System as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide all the needs that cannot be provided in the home where the child is taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet bring an additional dimension in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization have been proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and continuous relationships were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting small facial changes.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President Speaks, showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He suggested that the ability to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two types of genetic variation groups: hidden and manifest.
New genetic changes are the addition of mutations and selection of removals from a set of prominent changes.
Isolation and recombination reshaped the variation between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it's very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human to meet its amino acid needs from an existing plant source.
Moreover, failure to do so would have serious consequences: increased depression, poor nutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant source of protein is found in leaves and beans, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ant, duck, egg) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors were coping with their protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
A sleep disorder is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep briefly (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a silent alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, diuretics unknown) before bedtime, forcing a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of calmness in one's mind has the opposite correlation to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive life spirits there are, and everyone has the potential to find true peace and contentment.
The only thing that prevents us from achieving this is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddhism, but has been extended with the mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism has very simple principles, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of total love.
Kundalini energy (energy of consciousness) is triggered with Kundalini Yoga through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods, depicting various gods cleansing energy channels, activating chakras and creating inner awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. By the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes and cultures had caused the two countries to split.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be fought in the flesh by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17th, 1939, the Polish defences were shattered, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete in the aftermath, after 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian lines after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Neutrality Treaty, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods was the most efficient method of moving large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to ensure your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, while disrupting your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples of this is the WWII North Atlantic campaign, where the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, was trying to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to raise them for easier access to milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures, often tended by shepherds of goats who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the shepherds more familiar today.
Caravans were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon track consisted of only parallel wooden planks, it allowed the horse to pull it to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than the rougher roads of the era.
Cross-ties were introduced relatively early to hold the local track.Landai, however, realized that the track would be more efficient if it had an iron bar on top.
This has become the custom, yet the iron has made the wooden wheels of the chariot rusty.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron track was laid.
The first known transportation was walking, humans started walking vertically two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their overseers, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in their usual way.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want to just have a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite clear that the world is changing a lot because of the advancement of human science and technology and the problems are getting bigger because of the overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyles of humans.
After it was adopted by congress on July 4th, a written draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of this document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, read to his staff in New York on July 9th, and the copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known extant wide-scale Dunlap book prints are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy is now lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and survived, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think it's a dinosaur because it has feathers and it can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
It has scaly legs and claws, lays eggs, and walks on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only contain one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and such numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terms.
Internal toxicity cannot be quickly proven. Symptoms, such as vomiting are quite common so it cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the remnants of an open container of medicine or toxic household detergent.
Check the label for the specific first-aid instructions for that specific toxin.
The term pepijat is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient practice with bedbugs, which are insects that have adapted well to become parasites on humans.
Both the murderous walls and the massages are altruistic, adapted to life in a nest or a dwelling place.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the process of adoption, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that the other spouse can take over as the parent of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
It is not alone, experimentation and experiments are tests used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's critiques have been accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the Western world found itself deprived of learning the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are typically highly dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to cycle independently even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase have used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two tests that marked whether the DNA in the phage was radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein was radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning information about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, taking pictures, and learning about the Bornean Tattoo Organ.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to work and are passed by others whose destination of work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation everyone, in some way, is involved and supports the transportation system based on the private car.
Science now shows that a massive carbon economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable bases that once supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the association and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about the quality of water or a collapsed bridge.
Why is the transportation system causing such complaints, why is it failing every day? Is it because of incompetent transportation engineers? Or is there something wrong at the fundamental level?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are difficult because the behavior of the driver is not predictable one hundred percent.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent manner; thus, traffic flows are also fairly consistent and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be taken into the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back to the side of their bodies.
This gives them a wide area of small places to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the sculptor and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and also the other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it holds more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramids continued to use stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza never surpassed in size and technical excellence their construction
The ancient New Kingdom of Egypt admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in law and official communication.
Italian is the daily language spoken by most of those who work in the state while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made of a mixture of four or more elements: earth, water, wind, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it's also theorized that they change into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of an atom is so small that a few trillion of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a very low status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without having to be near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is needed to combine a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy pedal up a hill, separating the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei which means they can be separated with little or no contact.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the high ground.
There may be more tides in the nearby areas because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory is focused on finding out what makes people tick or appeal to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been identified as they reach maturity as adults.
These theories look at what's inside a person that makes them want the things they want and what's in their environment that will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when managers start leading their former colleagues; on one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain part of an old gang of friends.
Managers like this have difficulty making unpopular decisions, executing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, one would turn into an unrecognizable individual who felt that he had to change everything that the team had done and give it his own personal touch.
After all, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leader and the other members of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but the differences are not significant.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for nearby physical groups.
They typically have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team where all members report. This invisible team sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to engage in the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all resources are used effectively across every functional part of an organization, creativity and intelligence can occur.
As a result, organizational processes that work together to overcome barriers can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition, and thus, it refines the field of research that makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch in computer science, dealing with attitudes, learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer answers and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like this have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as have been built into some home computers and video game software applications.
A study tour is a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher wants to take his students somewhere that cannot be visited by taking a bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual tours, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing the tour virtually is the best way to describe the tour and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year the website is updated, but the old version is kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with grammatical and spelling mistakes, the presence of an audience in general can change that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger began to work on improving the writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to be more aware of the world around them.The need to engage readers inspires students to write intelligently and engagingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can provide students with opportunities to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to internet material, students can determine their position in the context of other people's writing and also outline their own perspective on related issues (Oravec. 2002)
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital with a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the northern part is the Muskoka Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and those that pass by are not as steep.
All of these things and more make Ontario the true Canadian experience for out-of-town visitors.
Large areas of the northern part are relatively unoccupied and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that shocks many: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadians.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and the continent itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are separate countries, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land and it has been growing rapidly in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
There are advantages to wearing a ring (but not a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as discomfort and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed through the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting people, and don't be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, it doesn't become ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was discovered by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
Moroccan sultans rebuilt cities such as Daru I-Badya and gave the name Casablanca to Spanish merchants who established a base of business there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods around the old Medina such as tagin, pottery, leather goods, shisha and various small jewelry, but that is only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that permeated most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing war in the North Kivu region.
The city is also a site for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short trip.
Combined with its inaccessible location, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
This was one of the main stops during the PBS special Henry Louis Gates Wonders of the African World.
This city is different from other cities in the country, as it has more Arab style than African.
Kruger National Park (NKP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones with each supporting the other's wildlife.
It is one of the top attractions in South Africa and is considered the crown jewel of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily maintenance and entrance fee for the park.
It can also be beneficial for one to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is a place considered a major focus by many tourists.
The row of buildings that decorate Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a glittering bar chart that is increasingly interspersed with the reflection of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast of Kowloon.
The majority of urban development in the Hong Kong islands is concentrated on the land that straddles the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took as their own and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial history of the region, this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest with an area of 80 km (50 mi) stretching from the coastline to deep inland Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part within the Indian enclave is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves - they are among the last remnants of the wasteland that covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by water/swampland.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and is now estimated to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer living in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station in the district (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them mainly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the inter-district buses are always full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts have the Japan Coast Bus service, which is comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the Oyapock River with the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and it has two hallways that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group occupying the area now referred to as Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering crops and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Land of the Indians", was born as a result of the encounters of the Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish had begun a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve the character and identity of its original people.
Argentina is very famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here in other years.
For news about the tournament or where to buy tickets for the polo match, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) whose value is set equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currency may be taken; check with the owner in advance to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it experiences summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winters can be confusing: temperatures rarely exceed freezing, but wind and humidity make them feel colder than the thermometer readings.
There is no specific rain and dry season, the amount of rainfall is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be eaten or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, keep 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wild animals!
How docile they look, bison, deer, moose, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are huge, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be careful because strong smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking strong smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a famous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All of the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser, with nearly 200 American and German crewmen lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of the most important Tamasese chief Tupua Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland stretches across two harbours. The most popular beaches are found in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor district) coast is on the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming areas and most shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, on the fringe of the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is a family beach that is sometimes crowded with all sorts of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but is tasty and refreshing. Another local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're careful.
For Australians, the idea of a flat white coffee is foreign. A concentrated black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino has a high concentration of cream (rather than foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is the Belgian equivalent, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
The reef is visited repeatedly throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare in the reef area.
However, seek the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near the coast and near the estuary from October to April of the 1770s. They are occasionally found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, they rarely attack humans, most of them are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The saltwater crocodile does not live in the ocean actively, its main habitat being in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers peace of mind that they have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Typically travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or packages that combine the hotel and the flight at once.
They can also make a reservation for you if you need time to think about an offer or get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests should be sent through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of those attending a music festival decide to camp on site, and most of the entourage considers it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get in early to get a tent site close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
There's a party that has a special camping spot for families with kids.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as the voyage down the ice produces a loud noise to those involved.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms)
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually missing and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have a menu of food, drinks and entertainment, to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some places offer alcohol at home, but drunkenness can corrupt judgment, and all sober gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or across mountains should think about the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
The icy and snowy road conditions cause low friction and you can't drive as if you were driving on a normal dirt road.
During a blizzard, you can be trapped in snow for a short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blown snow or through condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow cover and cold are normal in most countries, and traffic is mostly smooth throughout the year.
Safari is the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to a journey overland to see the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and standard equipment that allows for good views.
Lions, cheetahs and star tigers are sometimes frightened and you'll see these animals better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a bush walk, hiking safari or footing) involves an adventure, whether for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having previously hosted in 1964.
If you book your 2020 flights and accommodations before the delay is announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not take effect until July 2020 when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Sterilizing wet clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels provide sterilizer and sterilizer boards for borrowing, although they are not provided in the room.
If there is no iron, or you do not like to wear ironed stockings, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Please take care not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, fire).
There are many ways to filter water, certain methods are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in other areas several minutes are required.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're worried, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not used to seeing in their home countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread lice or spread infections.
Self-infectious diseases or dangerous animals can injure or kill people forcibly, never confirming as a pest.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at a specific location.
Travelers heading to heavily taxed states can sometimes save money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through remote wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, beware of the steep, narrow lanes, and sharp curves that dominate.
The announced speed rates are clearly lower than before and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Surprisingly, cell phone service is stronger here than in other parts along the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The pastries found in Germany are quite tasty, and the pastries in Bavaria are quite sweet, rich in fat, and varied, similar to those found in the neighboring country of Austria to the south.
Fruit pastry is a common delicacy, with apples being made into pastry all year round, as well as cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but fatty pastry, you can try pastry named after the region of origin such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a herbal and spicy dish cooked with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualification, the term means food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now found throughout the islands, Javanese cuisine presents a variety of moderately spicy dishes, typically consisting of Javanese favorite flavorings of peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
A cradle is a support device for the rider's legs that hangs on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider but there are safety risks due to the potential for the rider's legs to get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot is caught in the bridle, he will be dragged if the horse escapes.
First, most riders wear boots with flat, rather narrow heels and soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather footrests to drop the saddle if pulled backwards by the rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with its various large walls and granite craters.
The view from the summit is spectacular, and climbers from all over the world continue to build new routes between its endless walls.
Hill-climbing sports that include skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve skating over a snow-covered surface with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity of the trip with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ski-wanderer planning the whole holiday around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a long time  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as inland skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related to but does not usually involve alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, mountaineering is done in steep terrain and requires harder skis and shoes.
Think of a ski trail as analogous to a hiking trail.
In good health you will cover more distances than walking - yet very rarely will you get cross-country skiing speed without a heavy backpack in a neat lane.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through various countries means having to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
But the Schengen Zone, it works a little bit like a country in this regard.
As long as you are within this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country separately, so it saves time, money and documents.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, but some tax agencies define items that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be less in places like North America than in Europe.
