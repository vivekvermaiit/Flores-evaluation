It is not always clear that dinosaurs had feathers, and theories are widely circulated, but they do not provide details of their fossil lifespan, coloration, or three-dimensional models.
Scientists have identified the vertebrae as having a distinct upper segmented school and a distinct lower segmented carotenoid or spindle.

Martelly's oath was administered by nine members of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
Martelly was the seventh PAP president in four years.
A month before, a presidential commission asked former PAP members to resign over the new measures aimed at rebuilding the village.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the outbreak of the anti-regime movement that began in October.
The move was unfortunate as it would have prevented the team from competing during the 2011 season.

Over four hundred thousand people voted in the 2010 federal election (two thousand ten), all of whom voted for Australia to become a republic, an increase of eight percent since 2008 (two thousand eight).
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, during the 2010 general election campaign, stated her belief that Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's term expires.
Thirty-four percent of all votes cast cast in the election gave the Conservatives the confidence that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last monarch of Australia.
In a narrow poll, 29 per cent of those polled believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believed Australia should never become a republic.

NexGen is a system the FAA claims will enable aircraft to fly faster and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older radar-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional elevators were installed and the overground railway had no way of stopping at Wembley, and car parks and drive-through and parking facilities were not provided on the land.
So the racecourse may be forced to close. There is no longer any trail because of the lack of transportation and there is no one to cross.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science discusses the formation of new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer, due to cross-breeding between the endemic Darwin's cypress, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched out into thin wires that can be wrapped or folded into a sheet.
It can be very thin, covered with other metals, or very smooth, and is usually used in the style of illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. We can construct an indicator using red clove juice.
The juice of the cranberry changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic.
The pH level is determined by the number of Hydrogen ions (H- of pH) in the chemical being analyzed.
The hydrogen ion is a proton that loses its electron (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
He then combined the two into one and then, washing his hands, the water became clear.
The pulse will react with the fingers and the soft tissue, causing the skin to tingle and then to shrivel.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a small flush toilet in each house, connected to the newly developed sewage system.
Remains of waste treatment systems have been found at ancient Minoan sites on Crete, and on Santorini, Greece.
The bath was also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the bath was often part of a public baptism where men and women gathered together.
To call someone thousands of miles away, we use satellites.
Satellites in outer space receive light and then bounce it back, often at the same time.
Rocket launchers launch satellites into space. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere is too dense to be seen from a dog's eyes.
It would take a giant rock over 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest thing it has done for us is to give us a lighter and faster ride.
This has brought us trains, cars, and many other transportation equipment.
Measure the area under the curve. The measuring rod has one half of a rectangle, one half of a yard, one half of a yard.
Finally, let's consider the tiny worms (such as the black-footed ferret) that eat the tiny, distant remains of many insects, fish, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job that each has and the competitive nature of the other.
Lions are highly social animals, preferring to live in large groups called pride.
And there were thirty lions in the midst of the hill-country, and thirty lions of the same age, and thirty young lions, and thirty young lions that were with them.
These mates are usually very close, like siblings or cousins, and they form a big family.
The lions' roosts resemble those of foxes and dogs, their mouths are like those of wild beasts and lions (though not all of them are big) are fierce, and they are dangerous.
The athlete was very clever, but the wise man laughed and ran away.
The four species in the genus Panthera are the lion, leopard, and jaguar. All four animals have hearing.
The beast was like a roaring lion, and his mouth was like the mouth of a lion.
It delights to eat every small animal. It is able to handle everything from the smallest to the largest, and it tracks down every creature of the earth and every bird.
The wise man thought that Ocelot was tracking and finding the worm that had eaten the food (sandal) through its mouth, and hiding the contents on the ground.
By this means their eyes are opened, their tongues are loosed, and their feet are straight. They can even swim like a dove to find food - or they can leap like a hawk to catch prey.
When a group moves away from its original habitat (for example, by moving down a mountain or along a river, or in a new harbor and then returning to its original habitat), it tends to stay in a separate area from its previous habitat.
To find the source of their strength and to defeat the enemy in the new territory, the new group must be different or become a stronger adversary than the one they had previously needed.
The natural body is not changed, it must remain as it is.
Before long, a newly formed sect begins to glorify its new territory, becoming as debased and debased as the other sects.
Thus, thousands or millions of years later, the two groups are no longer able to be modeled as one.
This process is called speciation, which means the production of a new species. It is not possible to avoid speciation, and thus it is important in evolution.
It removes the oxygen that plants use for their food, and removes the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., their food).
The plants obtain their food from the sun by photosynthesis and prepare themselves for the sun.
They build houses for themselves, they make clothes for themselves, they eat what they want. They do not grow vegetation, they do not grow grass.
The Mosaurus was a top predator in ancient times, but no one was harmed, except its fellow dinosaur.
The long vowel and the 70 straight vowels are the same, with the upper vowel added to the east, meaning there is no escape for the object that is being played.
I'm not sure, but it may have a double-tongued mouth, and it's also a turtle, a giant fish and other Mosasaurus that it feeds on, and it may be a cannibal.
It fights everything that enters the water, and even a giant dinosaur like Tirex may have no enemies.
When the Most abundant food was cooked, the non-Romanian or unusual portion included wild boar, peacocks, roosters, and a type of deer called the dormouse.
while the lowly one feeds at his table in humble surroundings, and the rich one enjoys the pleasures of life at the table of the rich.
Ancient Roman cuisine was influenced by European or Asian cuisines in the following centuries.
For example, there was no larva, no feathers, no scales, and no ancient Romans ate turkey.
The Babylonians built one of its principal temples, which was to be turned into a royal palace.
The people offer sacrifices to idols, and then many rituals or festivals are held to offer all the idols.
The temple was divided into two parts, and the first part was called the inner room, into which the priests only entered.
Another typical pyramid is the ziggurat, a pyramidal, tower-shaped structure built as part of a temple.
The tops of the towers were a hiding place for the lord.

All of the countries are Scandinavian, with a distinct identity and history, including the people, kings, cultures and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
Having seen the National Treasure map, it is possible that there is a real treasure map depicted on the back of the United States Declaration of Independence.
But this is true. The writing on the scroll is not the treasure box itself, but is the writing on the inside.
The first sentence of the Declaration of Independence is written on the seal, which reads "The first seal of independence was written on July 4, 1776". The fifth appears below the seal, on the lower left.
Although no one knows who wrote it, for the first time in its life, the large parchment scrolls (which are 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) were printed as a single sheet.
Thus, it is the same as if the notes were added as labels.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles resulted in the liberation of northern France, which had not yet been liberated in the south.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had invaded Germany in 1940 and worked with the war effort to resist.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what was known as "Operation Dragon".
Only two weeks after the liberation of France from the Allied forces, the Americans and the Free French forces left for Germany.
A civilization is a culture that is brought about by people being able to survive and help each other.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil or individual, and civil is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen or community, and civis, meaning city or town-state, and civitas, meaning community.
Cities are the cradles of civilization, the seat of knowledge and the offspring of knowledge, and the history of culture is the story of the interconnected and interdependent.
These subcultures, often later ones, retain the vestiges of their history and are thus considered a civilization.
In the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a central government under the Articles of Confederation. This government was not strong because of the Congress's exclusive power.
It reduces the power of Congress to impose taxes, and, because it has no national executive or courts, it relies on the authority of the states, often uncooperative, to enforce its actions.
He was not obliged to exchange taxes between the states and any taxes between the states.
These articles could be agreed upon by the whole country and could still be signed by the central government and usually without representation.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the two most successful football teams in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include boxing, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, horse riding, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 auto racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, with even international competitions and Olympic events following Italy in this one sport.
Japan has over 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because Japan consists of a group of islands, they are called "islands" geographically.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European navigators named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
By 1624, the Dutch East India Company had established a base in southwestern Taiwan, started processing grain and hired Chinese laborers to work in the sugar cane and sugar plantations.
By 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) had gained control of the western and central coast of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings in the small complex have been rebuilt as tourists learn about the origin of the site.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration was complete.
For example, the most commonly used format for still image photography in the world is 35 mm, and it was the dominant film size in the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but the main aspect ratio depends on the image sensor format of the digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, with a 36mm width and 24mm height.
This aspect ratio format (dividing by twelve to get the smallest possible ratio of even numbers) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) are identical or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-missed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining the regularity of image size.
It has been said that the most effective location for a main subject is on the cutting line that divides the figure into three parts, the vertical and the horizontal (see examples).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church was seen as rich and powerful.
For over a millennium Christianity had been present in the countries of Europe despite their differences in language and culture.
His authority affected all humanity, from kings to commoners.
The Christian principle of wealth must be shown to be in favor of the poor and needy and the church's taxation has a special reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and was the center of power and wealth, but many questioned whether this principle was ever fully realized.
After the war began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy proved effective, reducing the size of the military and civilian populations, but the blockade was in violation of generally accepted international law and codified in several international treaties over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom gained control of international waters by attacking incoming shipping, which could endanger neutral shipping.
Because of the uncertainty surrounding this tactic, the Germans also wanted their submarines to be unrestricted.
During the 1920s, the citizens and the nation were divided by their pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the long and costly First World War, the nations turned against the nation.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in America, he had only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former employer).
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of counting time, each stage of Chinese history or even the history of China had its own dynastic use.
It is among the longest-lived dynasties from the subcontinent, the best known of which was the Three Kingdoms period of 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a bitter war broke out between the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms became the bloodiest period in Chinese history as thousands of people died to obtain the great throne at the palace at Xi'en.
Many social and political developments included the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to individualism, and the emergence of a collective sovereignty over the individual rather than a centralized government.
After the revolution, many jobs opened up for all the great men who wanted to be successful.
The military was once distinguished by its size based on rank, but is now distinguished by its caliber.
The French Revolution set an example for people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was so fond of contemplating spiritual things that he would often take refuge in a cave called 'Hira' on Mount Noor (the cave).
He chose him, and after this time, gave him a permanent knowledge of the spiritual nature of Muhammad.
Perched on the top of the highest hill of Mecca, the isolated cave is visible from outer space.
You can hardly tell where he is from, except that he stumbles into the mountains and all the cattle are scattered.
The heavens were so high, and the mountains were so low, that none could enter into it, and the earth was so deep, that few could hear it.
The Great Pyramid at Giza, one of the seven wonders of the world, still stands.
Built by the ancient Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids built to commemorate the death of the pharaoh.
The Valley of the Kings contains the pyramids of the Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza" (the Great Pyramid being the largest of the pyramids), as well as smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
A large pyramid was built to commemorate the death of the second Pharaoh, and many smaller pyramids, including temples, were built to honor his wife and the wives of the second Pharaoh.
The upper arrow symbol resembles a letter V and the lower arrow symbol resembles staples or a rectangular shape with no lower edge.
The top is the part of the bow that starts from the tip and is then pulled up by the bow, or it is the part of the bow that starts from the bow (the hand that holds the bow) and then the bow is pulled up.
The upper arch usually produces a soft, high-pitched sound, while the lower arch is more subtle and shrill.
We have freedom of speech, but we do not need to set aside traditions that we have for traditions that we would not have been able to carry out ourselves.
The King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged three), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to flee to Paris from Versailles by a group of women on October 6, 1978.
On the train, the return journey to Paris was interrupted by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
Anyone who forced the King and Queen to open the train window would be killed.
On the night of the attack, a member of the mob carried a guard of the Palace of Versailles in front of the Queen.
The cost of the war was that the United States would take over the Philippines from its own Filipino people.
He ordered the payment of all U.S. taxes, interest and fees on Philippine government bonds to Wall Street banks.
The enormous profits made from the long-term poverty of the Filipino people were a major source of American policy.
To understand a person's home, you have to understand the story that drives the events of the message.
This was the period of time known as the High and Middle Ages, in Europe during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High and Late Middle Ages began before the Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, the last of which lasted until about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term covering a wide range of ideas in the field of technology, ranging from the motivation and influence of technology to the level of sophistication where human behavior is driven by the lowest common sense that is associated with the communication and knowledge of technology.
The broad consensus on what technology can do rests on two general ideas: that technological developments are independent of cultural and political influences, and that technology can affect the conditions of society in which it is inherent without affecting socially conditioned society.
If you put the cart before the horse and it sits still, you can say to the rider, "Here, put your hand under your foot".
The national grid system could not be developed exclusively for car types, so new production methods were developed that reduced the cost of owning a car.
The increase in the number of vehicles has led to a rise in the number of injuries, as well as to the discovery of new techniques in the field of health and surgery of the large organs.
This Romantic ring is unique in that it has a deterministic element of the word, which comes from Goethe's writings, fichte, and schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the place shapes the person. This would correspond to the customs and traditions of the place. Since these two are in harmony with the place, they are far superior to the laws that are imposed.
Just as Paris was known as the Fashion Capital of the Contemporary Era, Constantinople was considered the Fashion Capital of Europe during the Imperial period.
His fame as a virtuoso lasted from about 400 to 1100 CE.
This status was especially important in the 12th century, as merchants returned with gifts, for example, spices were bought at a premium from the Byzantine market.
This was the time of the transfer of the title of the Imperial Capital from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
The original usage was heavily influenced by the Byzantine term okko northeast.
Due to the narrowing of the communication channel, this causes the loss of the pattern in the period of twenty-five to thirty years (25 - 30 years).
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western European styles began to develop, and one of the major developments of the period was the wearing of the veil.
Subsistence agriculture is the agricultural practice of providing food for the needs of a family and its members.
Subsistence farming is a simple method of growing crops in an area, typically using local pasture, rotation crops, or other simple methods to produce large yields.
In the past, farmers and ranchers used subsistence farming methods, which are still used in many developing countries today.
A subculture is a group of people who have an idea of the century in which they live.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, culture, class, location, and gender of their members.
Whether it is language, art, religion, politics, entertainment, geography or other factors that constitute a subculture.
Members of a subculture typically use their sign language in a unique manner, covering all their styles and ways of speaking and arguing.
One commonly used method is to illustrate the importance of being aware of the number of cases in which food is damaged by negligence, negligence or intentional damage.
Such a child is called a "savage", or a wild child, whose body is bound up in a cage (often by his parents); some are so unkind that their parents scold them or refuse to accept them that they are mentally and physically depraved.
The surviving children may have experienced a beating or a fall before they left or ran away.
Some of them I said, "The wild animals have eaten them up!" Others, "The grass has been overturned!"
When the pig is released, the female shows her characteristic behavior, such as looking at or ignoring others.
If project-based learning is used to make learning easier for students rather than making learning fun, then scaffolding is a great way to do it.
Scaffolding is not a learning curve, but rather a support for students seeking to gain experience in learning to program or learn new projects.
Scaffolds can be virtual or physical, where the teacher acts as a tool and may be a removable tool such as a small paper shredder in Microsoft Office.
The virtual assistant internalizes the software to help students ask, request, and explain how to solve their problems.
There are many reasons why children are placed in foster care, ranging from neglect, abuse, or exploitation.
No child grows up in an environment where he is not ignored, treated and respected, but rather is.
The guard system is known to be a good place to eat.
Care systems must provide safe, effective care and maintain good health.
Foreigners need to give a reason for writing the defects in the house that they have inherited.
Internal links are important elements in mass and interpersonal communication.
Other influences from the internees led to increased dimensions in terms of gift use and gratification.
For example, learning and socialization are considered important attributes for use on the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The "self-defeating" and "self-destructive" behaviors were introduced as new motivational symptoms by Eighmey and McCord (1998) to help explain the self-defeating responses to websites.
This is the case with video recorders and because of the important role they play in the interpretation of microexpressions, the instantaneous motion of the spectrum is measured in milliseconds per second.
In fact, once it's been shown that I'm correct in the way I interpret microexpressions, we can know that someone is lying.
Oliver Sack, in his presidential address, showed how it is possible for a person who cannot understand a speech to have a brain injury to be able to judge its authenticity.
The proverb about the man who was blind says: "Even the dogs know what the dogs are saying".
According to twentieth century research, there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variations and cause them to be eliminated from the population of known variations.
The variation is due to the separation and recombination of the two genes over generations.
In fact, primates have difficulty absorbing amino acids from plants because they have a weakened digestive system.
Its failure has had a profound effect; growth depression, malnutrition, and even death.
The most easily available natural food source is the protein in leaves and nuts, which primates like us find difficult to digest without a meal.
In contrast, other animal products (beef, goat, egg) are not only difficult to digest, but also lack protein and essential amino acids.
All told, it should not surprise us that our brains are self-sustaining "protein-eating" in much the same way that chimpanzees are today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of excessive arousal during normal sleep, which lasts for approximately 10 to 60 minutes.
This is easily done by using a silent alarm to alert us to an emergency without actually taking a picture of us.
If we find ourselves teaching a certain way, it's not like we're sitting on the sidelines, we have to be there to explain it.
Other biorhythm choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water, tea, diuretics and ice) before bedtime, which can help to reduce dehydration.
The number of digits a person has is related to the number of digits in the human body.
The more positive the life experience, the more likely it is that all people have the potential to achieve a sense of personal fulfillment.
All men can find goodness. Only the one who resists is the mind of the difficult.
The Tibetan Buddhist tradition is based on Buddhist teachings, which are in turn based on the teachings of the Buddha, and the Indian yoga techniques.
The most common principles of Tibetan Buddhism are kundalini yoga, eternal life, and the path of love for humanity.
With kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (the energy of the mind) is built up through yoga postures, slow practice, reading and visualization.
The centerpiece of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Godhead, which focuses on the heart's contemplation of the gods, purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras, and elevates the so-called enlightened consciousness.
Germany was the main enemy during World War II, along with the Soviet Union and the United States, and the end of the war affected the political and cultural systems of many other countries.
Two years after the war, the two opposed sides joined forces and the Cold War began.
It began 40 years ago and was fought largely by proxy forces, on the battlefields of Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, and the only hope was to be relieved and ordered back to the Romanian front.
However, these plans were thwarted when over 800,000 Soviet troops, including the Red Army, signed the Treaty of Riga, banning the Soviet-Polish invasion, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Ships were used to carry goods, which was a convenient way to transport people and goods across the sea.
The Navy's traditional role is to ensure that our nation is protected from invasion, and to keep the enemy at bay.
One of the most prominent recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, in which the United States attempted to divert men and material across the Atlantic Ocean in aid of the United Kingdom.
The German navy, all equipped with U-boats, tried to block the road.
Considering the Allies, it is possible that Britain was conquered by Germany like other European countries.
The domestication of goats began about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The Matoa culture began to focus on the hunt for milk, fat, meat, and oil.
The goats were usually grazed on the open country pasture, and the young male or female shepherds used to graze them.
Wagonways were built in England during the 16th century.
The chariot was made of a bamboo stick, and the horses could easily pull it because of the swiftness of the reins and the heavy weight of the saddle in those days.
Crossties were used to hold the rail in place, but the road was much narrower if the rail had a metal edge on top.
This became common practice, but the heat caused the wheels of the lorries to quickly wear out.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was put into service.
Walking as a means of transportation first appeared about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Its ancestor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright in the usual way.
Bipedal specializations were found in Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 Ma, while Sahelanthropus was able to use two legs as early as 7 Ma.
We can start to become more environmentally conscious, we can join the environmental movement, we can become activists and act to reduce our future dependence to some extent.
Like symptomatic treatment in many cases, if a temporary solution is not needed, then we should look for the root of the problem and try to deal with it.
Obviously, the world is changing rapidly due to advances in human technology, and problems are becoming more acute due to the increasing population and increasingly destructive lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, the manuscript was signed by Congress President John Hancock and his Secretary Charles Thomson and sent several blocks away by a visit from John Dunlop's print shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced per night, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read by his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 8.
25 The only Dunlap tablet known to exist is a copy of an ancient document that is still preserved. The original handwritten copy has not survived.

Traffic Flow is the study of the behavior of traffic flowing between two points that interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the current of the highway because the direction of the current cannot be determined with certainty.
Fortunately, the number of roads and the number of traffic jams are usually fixed; therefore, the number of traffic flows is usually fixed and can be calculated using mathematical methods.
To better describe the flow of traffic, the relationship has been constructed from three main features: 1. flow 2. area 3. velocity.
These relationships are useful in the planning, design, and operation of the road infrastructure.

For example, over the years students at the Bennet School in North Carolina created a website that featured their trips to the state capitol, and over the years the site was remodeled, keeping the original website online and making it look like a clipboard.
Blogs can also help students develop their level of writing skills. Typically students often begin their blogging experiences with random grammar and spelling, and the presence of a general blog readership can help this.
Since students are the most critical readers, bloggers began to write sentences to avoid criticism.
Blogging "encourages students to better understand their environment" It is necessary to attract the attention of the readers and inspire students to be interesting and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school curriculum.
The focus on the use of blogs can make students more analytical and critical; through active online feedback, students can define their own position in the context of other peers' opinions and can also describe their own perspective on certain issues (ORAVEC, 2002)
