This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Paleontologists say that the animal's feathers were brownish-brown above with pale or carotenoid undersides.
Discovery also looked at the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed race, called axes, but only had secondary traits of feathers - scales and spiracles - researchers have concluded that axes were probably a later, gradual evolution of these secondary traits.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or for display.The researchers suggest that although this tail is that of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows plumage from an adult animal rather than a chicken.
The researchers suggested that, although this fossil is a small dinosaur, the specimen shows adult and non-puppy feathers.

The road to the accident was closed for a short time as emergency services released the driver of a red Audi TT.
He was taken first to James Baggett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
She has since become an advocate in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh for the murder of her son.
She is being held pending charges and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness could be compromised as her photo was widely circulated.
It is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have considered that publication of the photographs could be potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "one journalist would appear to be in no danger if he published photos etc. of suspects".
The Crown Court, which is responsible for the prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment was issued.
The document, according to the leak, would refer to the border dispute, which Palestine had over the border before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered were the future state of the Holy Land for both peoples and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the Valley for ten years once an agreement was signed whereas the Palestinian Authority agreed to keep this presence for only five years.
The archery in the complementary pest control experiment had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, and there the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's Hunting Programme.
According to Mick Ahlin, acting director of parks and heritage conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting had received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Board (CEB).
It was Martelly's fifth CEP exam in four years.
A presidential commission recommended last month the dismissal of the former provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee also questioned Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests erupted over the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving hardware.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of heatstroke, which the company described as "not serious".
The Ministry responded by describing Apple's delay in reporting as "extremely regrettable".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 am local time (Friday 09:19 pm GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management in Northern Mariana Islands reported no damage in the county.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took two Hong Kong tourists hostage and hijacked their bus in Manila, the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza crashed into a snowbank on the M16 motorway.
We have rescued a good number of hostages and confirmed at least six deaths so far.
We were able to rescue six hostages, including children and a woman, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographer then took my place quietly because she needed to take a bath. They then cut her hair.
Liggons followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynaecologist and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While employed at the hospital, Ligonnes began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research has shown that giving hormones speeds the development of the lungs of the unborn.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders from the black box on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers have praised her highly.
"Luna was Extreme's first queen. My first boss. She died on a moonlit night. She was as unique as she was. A strong woman". said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin " Goldie " Runnels commented , " As scary as I was ... I could be more ... I love her and I miss her ... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This view is shared by 34% of respondents, and they believe that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
Lastly, it is conceivable that 29 per cent of those polled think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle and in three events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to a complaint, his fitness was called into question.
He cannot take the medication necessary to manage his pain and has been banned from participating in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime ever known on January 25.
Several people checked the discovery using various devices and software by early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets, and especially the Earth, formed when comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo , 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He referred to rumours as "political and absurd gossip".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and give pilots more accurate information.
There is no additional public transport operating and trains do not stop overground at Wembley, and parking and boarding facilities are not overground.
Concerns over traffic congestion have also led to the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors without fans in attendance.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to have taken much longer, due to cross-breeding between the endemic Darwin's bird Geospiza robusta and the migratory finch cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
We can make different shapes of gold. It can also be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled by thin wires, which can be twisted and rolled. It can also be unwound or folded into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "Enlightening Manuscript".
This is called the chemical's hydrogen number. You can make an index using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or the alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in a test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Glue the towels together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a sort of covering.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a lavatory arranged in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
Remains of sewerage networks have been discovered in houses in Minoan Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would share in a mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and then plays it back, very slowly.
A satellite is launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere obscures some of the light and visibility.
This work required a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The automobile has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the automobile has done is provide a faster and easier means of transportation.
We have trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Beneath it, only the medium-sized bass eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and deer.
Finally, there are many small lizards (including the pet lizard flycatcher) that eat smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, which is a special function of each individual that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the mammals, living in large groups called pride.
The litter consists of one to three adult males, plus up to 30 females and lions.
Women tend to be more related to each other, as they are a larger family of brothers and sisters.
Lions behave very proudly like packs of wolves or dogs, and the animals are remarkably similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behaviour, and also very lethal to their prey.
A tiger, as a well-rounded athlete, can climb (though not very well), swim, leap long distances and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus) as the lion, the leopard and the tiger. Only the four lions can roar.
A tiger's roar is not the same as a lion's roar in full voice, but it does sound like a series of chronic loud words.
Assault dogs love to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, insects, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all animals that an assault dog catches are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that sloths track and find prey animals by smell, and sniff their way onto the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move well in the dark. Oscilotes capture their prey by blending into their environment and then destroying it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from its parent population (such as when moving across a mountain range or a river, or when migrating to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new residents will need different features or adaptations to be more competitive than they were before.
The natives have never been changed, and they will never need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to acclimate to their new environments, they begin to appear less frequently than other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two societies will appear quite different and may even be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, and it only aims at the creation of new species.Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and manufacture our food from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was the strongest predator of its era, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are lined with more than 70 teeth, plus another set with a topped roof, which means that there is no escape for anything in its path.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it was a forked-tongued god. Its diet probably consisted of turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, possibly anthropomorphic.
It also attacks everything that enters the water. Even giant dinosaurs like T. rex were in Zeo.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had exotic or unusual holiday items, which included wild boars, peacocks, lizards and a type of rodent called a grasshopper.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals seated in chairs, the rich men liked to make amends together and rest beside them while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include the foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
I mean, they didn't have corn, they didn't have potatoes, they didn't have cocoa, they didn't have flavoring or the old-fashioned Roman taste of turkey.
The Babylonians built for all their gods a major temple that served as a home to the deity.
People would make offerings to the gods and priests would try to satisfy the gods through festivals and ceremonies.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner courtyard that only the priests could enter.
Occasionally, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special place for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the square; shops were open counters facing the street. And they used stone to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland settled for a while. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and called it Gr√∏nland.
But despite its discovery, it was inhabited at the time by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you'll be pleased to know that the treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct. Although there is a label on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is below the document in reverse.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its earliest lifetime, a large manuscript document (measuring 29 inches by 24 inches) was sealed for safekeeping.
Therefore, the code may simply have been added as a label.
The landings that day and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy. These are the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, calling the invasion "Operation Dragoon I".
In just two weeks, American and Free French troops had been liberated in southern France and were marching on Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work together as a community.
The word civilization derives from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, also reflecting in some way the size of the community.
Nations or cities are the ancestors of nations. Civilization is the transmission of knowledge across generations, and the perpetuation and diffusion of a cultural identity.
Secondary cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence of their relevance and fail to be recognized as adequate civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government - of which Congress was the sole constituent - according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to tax, and because it lacked a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on the state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its actions.
It also has the power to override interstate taxation and customs laws.
The documents required unanimous consent of all the states before being amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with the Germany national football team, the second most successful football team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's island group, it is often said that Japan, from a geographical perspective, is "one archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, and began to diversify native grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows Room.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
When I arrived in 1976, we had recovered 30% of Machu Picchu and the restoration is still going on today.
For example, the most common photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, the most common size of film at the end of the analogue film era.
Today it is still produced, but more importantly the width-to-height ratio has been inherited by the more sensitive digital camera formats.
The 35 mm figure is actually a human-confusing work, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
This says that the ratio of the width to the height of this format (divided by twelve to get the smallest integer ratio) is 3: 2.
Many well-known formats (the APS format set, for example) have a width-to-height ratio that equals or approaches that which we have just given.
The often misused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics and maintains some order in an image.
The rule states that the most efficient location for the central subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three vertical and horizontal segments (see this example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a millennium, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together despite their differences in language and customs.
Her all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
A core Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's cash is there for that purpose.
Central authority had been vested in the Church of Rome for over a thousand years, and the fact that both power and money were associated with it led many to question whether this principle was even held in practice.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved successful, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in numerous international conventions over the past two centuries.
Britain has blocked international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire stretches of ocean, and this poses a danger even to neutral shipping.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with a 4-cent bill, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's phases or each ruling dynasty had a distinct dynasty.
Also within each dynasty was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most notable of these was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, a fierce war was fought between several nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying while sitting in the highest seat of the Great Hall in Xian.
There are many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to any single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, professions were opened to all young applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on class, military ranks are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class children in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond the mundane. He would go to a cave known as ÿ≠ÿ±ÿßÿ° on the mountain ŸÜŸàÿ± meaning "light") to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
The location of the cave is on a hilltop to the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if one knows of its existence. Because once you are lost in a cave, you become completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the beautiful clear sky above and a few surrounding mountains. There is very little in this world that you can see from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to the present day.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC is one of several large pyramids built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "City of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), many smaller tombs, numerous temples, and a mausoleum.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honour Khufu's wives and family members.
An " upper " is a sign of a V and a " lower " is a basic element or square minus its lower side.
Up means you start at the edge and push the arrow, and down means you start at the frog (where your hand grabs the arrow) and pull the arrow.
Usually the top arch produces a softer sound, while the bottom arch is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to draw your own markings in pencil, but remember that printed curves exist for a musical purpose, so you must respect them.
The frightened King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young sons (Mary Therese aged 11 and Louis Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 because of a large influx of women merchants.
In a car, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting and booing against the King and Queen.
A mob forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their caravans.
On one occasion a member of the audience praised one of the royal guards who had been killed in a duel in front of a terrified queen.
The Filipino people paid for the war expenses of the American imperialist invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear a large portion of the costs and benefits of the bonds secured in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
And of course, the huge profits made from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be a major gain for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context in which they were created.
The High Middle Ages, also known as the Renaissance, is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from the drive for technology or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is tied to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself takes a path that greatly exceeds cultural or political impact, and that technology in turn has "mediated effects" on native communities, rather than being socially conditioned.
So for example, one could say that the car makes us feel necessary to travel.
However, the national road network was not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
The mass ownership of cars increases the rate of road accidents, leading to the development of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to this geography emerged, which, in harmony with the place of society, were preferable to arbitrary imposed rules.
In the same way that Paris is recognized as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of wealth began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its importance declined in the 12th century mainly due to the return of the Crusaders with gifts such as silk and spices which were worth more than what was offered in the Byzantine bazaars.
At this time the title of the capital of fashion moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Early dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western models can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments during this time was the result of the Crusades, in which people started using buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds native to the ecosystem in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, race, class, location and/or gender of members.
The traits that define a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members often express their subculture through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, attitudes and controversies.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, bad luck or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their development.
These children are called "savages" or "savages". Some children are locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases this abandonment is due to the parents' refusal to allow the child to have a significant mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered child abuse or severe trauma before they could escape or flee.
They claim that animals have evolved; some say they lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by nonhuman animals, feral children will exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that are very similar to those of their animal peers, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While the PBL should make learning easier and more exciting, the ladder goes further.
Skills are not a learning tool but rather a support tool that provides support for individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new business.
Ladders can be both virtual and real, in other words, a tutor is a form of a ladder and is also a miniature paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Including Virtual Scaffolds in the software is intended to ask and answer questions and explain procedures that might be difficult for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
I don't see any child growing up in an environment where you don't care for them, nor do you raise them, nor do you work for them, but I see them that way.
We know that the nursery is a safe place for these children.
The foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, friendly caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that the previously adopted homes needed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and private communication.
The peculiarities of the Internet take us to further dimensions in terms of approaches to usability and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement and ""relationship continuity"" were also cited as novel motivations by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has enabled us to discover important phenomena by interpreting subtle expressions, facial gestures that last fractions of a second.
In particular, they say that one can detect whether someone is lying by interpreting the exact expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks explained in his paper ' `` The President's Speech ' how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
It also suggests that such a capacity to explain human behavior might be shared by domesticated animals such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
The mutation introduced a new genetic variation, and led to the identification of the group of variation expressed.
Separation and recombination serve to switch the difference back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Also, failure to do so has dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and eventual death.
The most easily accessible plant resource is protein, which can be obtained from the leaves and berries, but is difficult for our primates to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites and eggs) are not only difficult to digest and digest, but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not be surprising if our ancestors solved the "first protein problem" in some way similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna do it today.
Insomnia is a conscious act of falling asleep during a regular sleep period and going to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so that you have to get off the couch to turn it off.
Other options based on the circadian rhythm involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which will force the person to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress on his body and mind.
The less stress we have, the more positive the energy of existing life is. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
It is possible for everyone to achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but expanded upon through the MahƒÅyƒÅna path of love and various methods of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of totality love.
With Kundalini Yoga, one awakens Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chanting and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yuga . By visualizing various deities, it purifies energy channels, activates chakras and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.As the war ended, clashes of order, method, and culture led to the breakup of the nation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for 40 years and be fought in real time, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were completely overwhelmed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman Bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Byelorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ocean-going vessels is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The function of the navy has traditionally been to ensure the ability of your country to transport its own people and goods, while also intercepting the ability of your enemy to transport their own people and goods.
One recent example to note is the North Atlantic Campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were attempting to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to assist the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, which was mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have invaded Britain just as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran .
Ancient cultures and tribes began to be preserved for their easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Pasture goats were generally raised in herds roaming the hills or in secondary grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, as in the current grazing system. No pasture roads are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the carriages were only wooden planks running parallel, they allowed the horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than those travelling on the rougher roads of the day.
Crossties were introduced somewhat early to stabilize the tracks in place. Gradually, however, they learned that the tracks would be more efficient if there was a piece of iron overhead.
It became common practice, but the iron caused corrosion of the wooden frames of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden rails were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first complete railway was built.
The earliest known forms of transportation were walking, humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (erect man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not typically walk in a straight line.
Two-legged specimens were found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 Ma, although the coast was walkable by seven Ma.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become active in order to reduce some future suffering.
This is just like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we are only starting with a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem, and we must stop it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed dramatically due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have been made worse by the growth of population and the expensive lifestyle of mankind.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent several blocks away to John Dunlap's press.
Overnight they produced between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "The Dunlop Frontier".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on Independence Hall Square on July 8 .
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 extant Dunlap brochures are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy is not extant.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs lived and are still alive today: the birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like T-Rexes.
Almost all computers in use today rely on processing information encoded in binary digits.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, for computer language use.
Internal toxicity can be severe. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that we cannot make a diagnosis immediately.
A good indicator of internal intoxication is considered to be an open container of toxic medication or household chemicals.
Look at the label and pay attention to the first-aid instructions for that specific toxin.
Entomologists use the term bug in the formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have adapted greatly to infest humans.
Both the Assassin-bugs and the Bed-bugs are friendly insects, and they have adapted to living in their host's nest or apartment.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of the child, to raise the child.
Such couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption , the adoptive parents terminate their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This is how most people learn to do scientific research.
But it is not a hypothesis; it is an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to test one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, make observations, and conduct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted by almost all scientific disciplines, including psychology.
As Greek scholarship declined, the West found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are usually based on the presence of internal cycles produced by the circadian clock.
We have recorded cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclic signals, for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The circadian clocks are oscillators that keep time from cycling freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first major pieces of evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey & Chase used viruses, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
Two experiments were performed to isolate DNA from the mouse using radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur-containing proteins.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in cells of the germ line alone can be passed on to children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism appeals to people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be to visit, photograph and identify orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to work and see others who have the same job they just left.
With this new dynamic transportation coming, everything is somehow connected to a transportation system that depends on and is supported by private cars.
Science now suggests that this huge carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two billion years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
Similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges are rarely heard in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems behave like this, and fail on a daily basis? Do transportation engineers not understand this? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of motorists is not 100% predictable.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave in a reasonably regular manner; therefore, traffic flows usually have a fairly consistent pattern that can be represented by mathematical equations in an approximate form.
To better represent traffic flow, we make relationships between three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design, and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wide variety of small places from which to choose from among predators.
Today, the only insects that can fold their wings are dragonflies and the Mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right but many thought otherwise; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the ground moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river, at six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It brings together hundreds of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and constructional sophistication.
The ancient Egyptians of the modern state were fascinated by the relics of their ancestors, which were once over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least populated.
Italian is used in Vatican City's legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the people who work in the province, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything was composed of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was analogous to the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumed that they were transforming into new substances to form what we see.
A spike is essentially a mixture of one or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also get spikes that contain trace amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
And yes, the pencil was a good friend to many people when they were growing up.
Unfortunately, when new writing techniques were invented, the pencil was neglected for its limited space and uses.
People now type messages on computer screens, without the need for a pen.
One can only ask how the keyboard is doing when something new is added.
A fission bomb works by capturing the energy to unite a nucleus together with protons and neutrons.
As a heavy truck rolls up the hill, splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to decay with little or no propulsion.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the shell is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under Maria and thicker under the Alps.
There may be an excess of water on the nearby cliff because the crust is so thin. It is easy for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding out what makes people like or like a post.
These theories state that people have certain needs and/or desires that they satisfy as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what some people are led to believe about the things they do and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's second factor theory.
In general, behaviour can change when managers start referring to their former peers. One of the ends of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary action, performance appraisals, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes unrecognizable and feels compelled to change everything the team has done and leave it all to Elo.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their live physical group.
They often enjoy greater autonomy than traditional team members meaning that their teams may be convened according to different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real "unseen singularity" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique feature of the virtual singularity.
The Invisible Team is the management team whose every member belongs to God. The Invisible Team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational organization? One of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively by the functional departments of an organization, creativity and excellence can emerge.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead us to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide a physical guide to the theoretical approach to cognitive inquiry. This narrows the field of inquiry and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain and behavioral pathology supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as to recognize handwriting, voice and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are currently used extensively in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been developed into many computer software applications and home video games.
School trips are a big part of any class. Often, teachers will want to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting with their class.
A field trip is almost always a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital, and they redesign the website each year, but keep the old versions online as a souvenir.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Students often start their blogs with poor grammar and spelling, and the general public tends to ignore this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, a blogger will begin to seek to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to nurture public interest leaves students smarter and happier (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool, and it encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "may allow students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can position themselves to other people's writing as well as to their own views on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and is home to a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the far south are Niagara Falls and to the north are the untouched natural beauties of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what the West considers to be essentially Canadian.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and almost uninhabited.
To compare demographics, this will surprise many: African Americans living in the United States outnumber Canadians.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and is a continent unto itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent states, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the country, largely conquering the Comoros and Maut.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Coast Region, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It is advisable to tell any traveler that she is married regardless of her actual social status.
It is also advisable to wear a ring (not a very expensive one.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they may consider harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed or held by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber hunters in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinians as a strategic port named Nava.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, but abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Abadiyah and named it Casablanca for the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In all parts of the old town, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as chickens, pottery, leather goods, silk and a whole range of Jigaw ware, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo destroyed much of the city, especially the downtown core.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, we must seek out visits from outside Goma to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and one of the cheapest places in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
You can use the Buda Buda (motor bus and taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) fare is about 500 CFA francs for a short trip.
Unable to be transported, Timbuktu was used as a passage to foreign lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, yet it is famous as a tourist attraction, and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the stations featured during the Henry Louis Gates Show on PBS's African Wonders of the World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each with a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and regarded as one of the most outstanding national parks in South Africa (the Sunparks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily maintenance and admission fee.
It is also possible to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to a select group of South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is where many tourists consider to be its center.
The parade of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong resembled a plan such as the Glittering Ribbon that could be seen through the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong , leave the island and go to the Kowloon Waterfront opposite .
The bulk of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been largely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is where the British colonists made their home, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is arguably the largest coastal strip of coastal sand dunes in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 mi) into remote areas of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they are some of the last remnants of the enormous thickets that once covered the Ganges Basin.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water / marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and almost 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 wild deer now roam the area.
Buses leave the station between the two districts (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar / Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-county buses are usually full , it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance .
Most areas are served by comfortable and reliable small Japanese buses.
Service cars are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Barrow (No. 150) and Ponca (No. 200).
The Ouyapouk River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Ouyapouk River connecting the cities of Ouyapouk in Brazil and Saint-Georges-du-Louyapouk in French Guiana.
The towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two 3.50 m wide corridors.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres . Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017 .
This bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when it will clear Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the main indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, where they lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaicuru and the Paiagua, who subsisted by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three hundred years.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Canitas.
Leagues and mini-tournaments can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
For news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the website of the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in the islands which is in Stanley opposite the F.A.C. West store.
Pound sterling is accepted everywhere in the islands, and Stanley and US dollars are often accepted as credit cards.
Credit cards may be accepted in remote islands, although British and American currency are also accepted; therefore it is recommended that you check with the owners before going to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It is virtually impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your bank account before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. So in the summer months, temperatures can be over +30 degrees Celsius.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and moisture combine to make the atmosphere cooler than the thermometer would indicate.
There are no "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is virtually constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife!
No matter how vulnerable they are, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors die because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, if you know that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, you will avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British warship was sunk. About 200 Americans and Germans were found dead.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of Supreme Leader Topowa Tamase Lilofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is sandwiched between two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor area) has beaches on the Pacific Ocean stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe to swim in, and most offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
It is a family beach with good beachfront shops and is sometimes crowded. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer, but is delicious and refreshing. Another local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines one can drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better suited.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but the water bottle is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is a strange one. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes poured with a pinch of cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices, though expensive, are excellent.
I see many coral reef expeditions throughout the year, and injuries from any of these coral reef causes are rare.
However, seek the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay close attention to safety precautions.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. Occasionally it can be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean; their main habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep as soon as he reaches his destination.
Travel agents will often have deals with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through the travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even shared airline and hotel packages.
They can also reserve a reservation for you if you need it while you are considering the offer or have other paperwork for your travel destination (such as a visa).
However, any adjustments or requests must be checked through a travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of festival goers choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get in early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music in the main theatres may have stopped, some sections of the festival may still be playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in the evening, check the position of the cabin, as walking on the ice causes a lot of noise for people who are injured.
Cruise ships to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by their patrons. Windows and clocks are often missing, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings to keep guests entertained and entertained in the building.
Some places serve alcohol at Yates. However, sugar impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sane.
Anyone driving on high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is less friction and you cannot drive as if on bare ground.
In blizzards, enough snow can fall to cause you to get stuck in a very short time.
Visibility may be limited by snow or sleet or by condensation or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic flows almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safari tours are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important to many visitors.
The term safari tour is commonly used to refer to traveling on land to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars, and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs and elephants are shy and easier to see with the naked eye.
A walking safari (also called a "push walking", "hike safari", or "walk") consists of a walking tour of either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two editions of the Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the cancellation announcement, you may be in for a rough ride.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will run until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket costing around 7,000 yen.
A damp conscience may help to cool off. Many hotels provide a sofa and a dining table for rent, even if no one is in the room.
If the pantyhose are not available, or if you do not want to wear the pantyhose, you can try using the trousers, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the cloth (which can cause chafing or burns in extreme cases).
There are different methods of water purification, some more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, consider replacing your water with a filter from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse cause allergies, spread toxins, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully infect or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
A free market is an opportunity to buy goods duty-free in certain places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is considered the most difficult driving circumstance on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it passes frequently through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: most roads have steep inclines, narrow passages and steep curves.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to these is more important than anything else.
Strangely, mobile service is much stronger here than on many other stretches of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very delicious, and in Bavaria very rich and varied, like that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are popular, with apples being cooked in pies all year round, and cherries and peaches appearing in summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, walnuts and other types of nuts. A popular cake is often associated with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small pastries with filling, try Berliner, Funke oder Krapfchen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables in it.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, the use of curry milk is common; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is more common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a broad term that covers a wide range of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualifiers, the term tends to denote food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simple dishes, the predominant Javanese flavors being peanut, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The saddles are supports for the two riders to descend on either side of the saddle.
They offer more stability for the rider but may have safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's legs getting caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his leg gets caught in the stirrups, he may be injured if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, some safety precautions may be taken.
First, the rider wears riding boots with heels and soft, fairly narrow shoes.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the occupant to fall off the saddle if pulled over by a falling rider.
Cusamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with its diverse array of large granite walls and boulders.
The peaks have breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes within its walls that have been eroded away.
Slope sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving skiing over snow-covered terrain with skis or a skateboard attached to a sled.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called 'ski hangers', planning to spend an entire skiing holiday at a particular resort.
The idea of skiing is very old  the cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The history of downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking and skiing: Also called skiing in the countryside, ski tours or snowshoeing.
It is related to , but usually not including, alpine skiing or mountaineering, as the latter is done on steeper terrain and requires more rigid skis and shoes.
Think of a ski trail as a kind of hiking trail.
In favourable conditions, you will be able to cover some greater distances on foot - but you will rarely get around at cross-country speeds without a heavy backpack on well-traveled roads.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it contains many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling across different countries involves going through visa and passport controls many times.

As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Also, by obtaining a Schengen visa , one does not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member states separately, thus saving time, hassle and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an artifact. Some tax authorities classify goods over 100 years old as an artifact.
The definition has some geographical variation, meaning that it may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Crafts can be defined as artworks, even if they are smaller than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood among the Sami, and trade-related culture is important to many other occupations.
Even in traditional terms, however, not all Semitic peoples engaged extensively in reindeer husbandry, and they subsisted on fishing, hunting and such, and were mostly reindeer herders.
Many Sami people today work in the new trades. Tourism is an important income in Sapporo, the Sami region.

Transgender people should expect to go through a screening process before surgery to maintain their privacy and dignity.
A tidal current is the backflow of waves that cross a shore, often near a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few segments deeper, and a fast current can form to the deep water there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue while trying to swim against the current, which is impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming backwards is no harder than it used to be.
Try to target a place where you can be caught again or, depending on your skills and if you have been spotted, you may have to wait for rescue.
Recurrent trauma may occur earlier than culture shock (especially during the honeymoon period), last longer, and may be more severe.
Sometimes, travelers who have had great ease adjusting to a new culture have a particularly hard time adjusting back to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your familiarity with your home culture.
When I first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, recognizing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
The Pyramid Light and Sound Show is one of the area's most popular attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and can peer at them silently before the performance begins.
There is usually always the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a story in a book.
A Hullman uses it as the background and narrator of a long story.
He showed scenes of the pyramids and showed different pyramids.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by more nations and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active units as of 2020.
The archipelago is located about 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other places include Livingston Island, the submerged calderas of an active volcano that gave us a beautiful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost area of the peninsula, bounded by Bellingshausen Bay.
The peninsular mountains here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 225-mile-long (360 km) Ellsworth Range, through which the Minnesota Glacier flows.

Finland is a great place for boating. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the archipelago and on the lakes you don't need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the larger lakes are large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a capacity of seven or eight people per boat.
It is the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but differently it is completely unique (as in the Netherlands for example, the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days and return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you go to the beach only using the cruise ship, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in brochures. As you can see from the map above Berlin, there is no place near the sea and the city visits are not included in the price.
Traveling by air can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled before or have had a traumatic accident.
It is not shameful: it is no different from the personal fears and hatreds that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft operate and seeing it during flight helps overcome a fear of the unknown or lack of control.
Express mail companies are well paid for fast delivery. Often times, time is of the essence with paperwork, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there has been a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If you send goods by air, please confirm within a few days of receipt of customs clearance.
The only way to get it was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines do not have regulations allowing baggage to be sent without a passenger, so it will arrive at your door.
The obvious way to travel first or business class is to pay a premium (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay about four times the usual business economy fare, and 11 times in first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines recognize that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium in exchange for the privilege of a quick and convenient arrival, and they will be charged for this.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the unilaterally proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.

Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, falcon, wildcat and capercaillie can be found, along with many endemic species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover both knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries provide blankets for unprepared women to enter, but if you bring your own, especially if it is a bright one, you will be happy to receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover both knees.
I might as well borrow it from the store by the entrance but they don't wash these dishes after every use so you can feel comfortable wearing them. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of the Mediterranean regions, relies on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), generally using olive oil.

More traditional churches often hold services on Easter Sunday during the Easter holiday, and worshippers often come to celebrate the midnight mass to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally reached the islands arrived here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, leaving the giant tortoise as the primary grazing animal on the Gal√°pagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Gal√°pagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the autumn, you experience polar night, which means that the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis , as the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Because the area is sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not often considered a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are the normal business attire, and business partners address each other by their surnames or by their job titles.
