Although an experimental vaccine appears to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, to date no drug has been shown to be clearly effective in treating an existing infection.
One combination of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but official studies showed that it did not help prevent deaths to the desired degree.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a comparator vaccine, meaning that the scientists compared it to the three other treatments.

This confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
The animal's plumage, according to the researchers, was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the bottom.
The discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed tail called a fin, but have other features of feathers - such as fins and feather rays - the researchers concluded that the fin was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for heat control or sound control, and although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the researchers presented the specimen as being from the plumage of an adult rather than the tusks of a juvenile.
Although the tail was that of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers presented the specimen as coming from the plumage of an adult rather than the plumage of a juvenile.

Luminosity and rotational motion are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less polar reversals occur in a star.

The work was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to detect tidal effects between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravitational pull affects the earth, causing tides, so the gravitational pull of the Milky Way affects the dwarf galaxy of Sagittarius.
The researchers were able to deduce that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the galaxy's dark matter is surrounded by a kind of radiant atmosphere, made up of a large number of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered a form of tuberculosis that is highly resistant to drugs (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was very worrying and alarming because of its extremely high mortality rate.
Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, Moll believes, and at least two of them were hospital health-care workers.
A person infected with HIV can infect 10 to 15 close contacts in a year.
However, the percentage of all TB cases with XDR-TB appears to be still below  6 000 of the 330000 annual infections in South Africa.

They are cooler by day than the surrounding surface, and warmer by night.
Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as that of the large caverns on Earth, which often have fairly uniform temperatures, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing, a member of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology working group and a professor at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has traditionally not been a high-tech process: voters lock themselves in a box and place a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope, on which they have marked the candidate they want.
After the identity of the voter has been confirmed by the authorities, the voter drops the envelope on the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law is relatively precise in determining the course of events.
In 1988 the ballot boxes were made transparent so that voters and observers could prove that there was no envelope in the box when voting began and that no envelopes other than the officially counted and authorised votes were added to the box.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the series of events, and in the evening, volunteers will count the votes under close supervision and following the prescribed procedures.

Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped a Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused have been named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed when the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of his son.
He's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may have been tampered with, as his photo has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and the courts have considered that the publication of images could be detrimental to the fairness of the trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists do seem to be balancing dangerously when they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Crown Office, the Scottish public prosecutor with overall responsibility for the prosecution, has given the journalists an understanding that they will not comment further on the matter, at least until the prosecution is brought.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to be the way they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed were the future status of holy Jerusalem for both nations and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a continuous military presence in the valley for 10 years from the date of the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority accepts such a presence for only five years.
The rangers were to monitor closely the shooters participating in the complementary pest control experiment, for the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Eligible volunteers were recruited as part of a joint project between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the NSW Federation of Sport Shooters and the Hunting Program of the Rifle Federation.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's Parks Conservation and Cultural Heritage Unit, the four shooters selected for the first shootings received extensive safety and training.
Martelly admitted nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's the fifth interim election board Martelly has been on in four years.
A presidential delegation last month recommended the dismissal of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, which at times turned violent, were triggered by the failure of elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reports of malfunctioning iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, the department announced that Apple had notified it of 34 other cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the investigation "really regrettable".
The earthquake tested the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m. Greenwich time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at a group of tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom, and Mendoza was killed in the shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm birth in his early years.
His research showed that administering the hormone accelerates the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that an official investigation team found two black boxes, or flight recorders, on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and she passed away on the night of the two moons, a pretty unique case, just like her, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe more so... I love her and I miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted before the 2010 federal election, and the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared her view and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme end of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was scheduled to compete in the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three swimming events at the Commonwealth Games, but her condition has been precarious because of pain.
He has not been able to take the necessary pain-relieving medication because its use is prohibited in the competition.
On January 25, computer science professor and mathematician Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime number ever known.
By early February, several people confirmed the discovery with various devices and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the earth, which was struck by comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year, and last month he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political cheekbones and ridiculous".
He's expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration claims that NextGen is a system that allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older technology based on ground-based radar, enabling air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft positions more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and no overground trains stop at Wembley, nor are there any parking and access parking services available at the venue.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science revealed the development of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that the new species had evolved in two generations, although the sequence of events was thought to have lasted much longer, due to cross-breeding between the native Darwin's plum (Geospiza fortes) and the newly arrived cactus (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes, and it can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted pictures in books called "book paintings".
This is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make the meter yourself using the juice of the redfish.
The colour of the juice changes according to the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
The number of hydrogen ions (pH of H) in the test chemical reflects the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then crush them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hand reacts to the outermost layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in Minoan cities in Greece, in Crete and on Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had baths, and in Roman civilization, the baths were sometimes part of public baths, where women and men bathed together in the same spaces.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space in a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket more than 100 feet long.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and moving much easier and faster is the greatest thing it has done for us.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them come the more medium-sized felines, which eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and perros.
Then there are many small felines (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, which number much more.
The secret of their success is an ecological box, a concept that allows each cat to have a specific job to do, so that it doesn't compete with others.
Lions are the most social of all the felines, and they live in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males and sometimes as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lionfish behave much like wolves or dogs, and they are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large felines), and they too are very dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump far, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same family of big cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and only these four felines can roar.
The tiger's roar is not reminiscent of the lion's full roar, but more of a phrase made up of hoarse, shouted words.
The Oselots love to eat small animals, and they will prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them, and almost all the animals they prey on are much smaller than the Oselot.
Scientists believe that the oselots track and locate food, or prey, by the smell of the ground they have passed.
Oselots have really good night vision, thanks to the twilight, and they move really inconspicuously, and they hunt by blending into their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or to a new island, so that it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different from what it was before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, but still needs the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the main population over time.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of a new species, and speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans inhale and use the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food by connecting to the sun, and they also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the great beast of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were topped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and its jaw had an extra row of teeth that made it impossible for anyone to escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus Rex couldn't have survived it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own peculiar or unusual delicacies, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the peanut mouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, whereas the rich preferred to have communal meals at which they would lie on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not serve the kind of food that only centuries later came to Europe from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to satisfy the gods' needs with ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then the inner sanctuary, the Most Holy, into which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurate were built in temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, and shops were just open tables selling on the street corners.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited, and in the Norse sagas, it was said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the island was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has some writing on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" are written on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence, and are written upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that a large parchment document (measuring 29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was originally rolled up for safekeeping.
It is therefore likely that the mark was added as a name tag.
D-Day, or the landings, and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was under the control of the so-called Vichy France, that is, the French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders, not fighting them at all.
The Allied invasion of southern France on August 15, 1944, codenamed Operation Dragoon, was a major offensive by the Allies against the French Third Army.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people living and working together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civilian or citizen, and it's related to the Latin civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it also kind of defines the size of society.
The city-states are the predecessors of nations.Civilized culture refers to the transmission of knowledge from one generation to another, a long-term cultural footprint and a high degree of diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving the necessary historical evidence, so they are not usually considered true civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, the only part of which was Congress, under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judicial branch, it had to rely on the often uncooperative state agencies to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have the power to change tax laws and interstate customs duties.
Amending the articles required the unanimous approval of all the states, and the states were so arrogant toward the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful football team in the world, after the German national team, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, hockey, roller derby, and F1 motor sports.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in them even in international matches and the Olympics.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), Japan is the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of its islands, Japan is often referred to as an "island" in a geographical sense
Taiwan was known as early as the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by mentioned the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the native peoples' grain-producing methods and hiring Chinese laborers for their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and proclaimed Taiwan a Qing Dynasty province in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common size used in still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced, but its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
A bit confusingly, the 35 millimeters is actually 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high.
Hence, the ratio of this size (divided by twelve to get the simplest overall ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family) either correspond to or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The oft-abused and much-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamic in the image while still maintaining some order.
It says that the most efficient place for the main subject is at the point where the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds intersect (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected all, kings as well as commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are intended for just such use.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question the fulfillment of the doctrine.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital supplies to soldiers and civilians, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by numerous international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to block ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the tactic only elicited limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolationism.
The nations, seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, decided to end it to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods: Each stage of China, or each ruling family, had its own dynasty.
In addition, there was a period of unstable provincial division between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit on the highest seat in the mighty palace of Xi'an.
The social and political consequences were many, including the introduction of the metric system, the transition from an autocracy to a republic, the quest for nationalism, and the belief that the earth belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, the offices were also opened to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and successful could succeed.
The same was true of the army, since military ranks were now based on ability rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside of everyday life, and he often went to meditate in the cave that came to be known as Hira, located on the mountain of Nur, meaning light.
The cave itself, which the tooth left in peace, creates a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located in one of the mountains to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's very difficult to find even if you know it's there, because once you're inside the cave, the isolation is perfect.
All you can see is a clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains, and inside the cave, you see or hear very little of the underworld.
The Giza Plain, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Giza Sphinx.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures made to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The rising arrow is a V-shaped mark, and the descending one is a square with no lower line.
The ascending bow means that you should start from the point and push the bow, and the descending bow means that you should start from the fross (the part you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
The rising bow usually produces a softer sound, while the descending bow is stronger and more coarse.
Feel free to add your own notes with a pencil, but remember that the printed arrows are in the notes for musical reasons, so they should generally be followed.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of working women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister Elisabeth, from Versailles back to Paris.
They came back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their chariots wide.
At one point, someone in the crowd shook the head of a bodyguard killed in Versailles in front of a shocked queen.
The Filipino people had to pay the war costs of the conquest of the Philippines to American imperialism.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to cover a considerable part of the cost and to pay the interest on the bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
The main benefit of US imperialism, of course, was the huge profits from the long exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the background against which the organization was born.
The Age of Events is usually referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history between 1000 and 1300 AD.
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended about the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the impetus of technology, or the necessity of technology, to the absolute notion that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two basic ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and second, that technology in turn has innate rather than socially conditioned "impacts" on societies.
For example, one could argue that the invention of the automobile inevitably led to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is leading to more road accidents, which is leading to the development of new health care methods to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a significant component of Romanticism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was seen as shaping individuals, and over time, the customs and culture of that geographical location were formed, and because they were in harmony with society, they worked better than arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began about A.D. 400 and continued until about A.D. 1100.
Its status weakened in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the supply of the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western European styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the era was the use of buttons to fasten clothes, which was introduced by the Crusades.
A subsistence farm is one that produces enough food to feed only the farmer and his family.
A self-sustaining economy is a simple, often organic, system using seeds native to the ecoregion combined with rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel rejected by society's norms, and thus are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct and distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexuality related, geographical or a combination of several factors.
Often, members of a subculture communicate their membership in a style by means of distinctive and symbolic behaviour, including fashion, mannerisms and their own slang.
One of the most common ways of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use the example of the few unfortunate children who grew up without adult socialization, either through neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse.
Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents), and in some cases, the abandonment is due to the parents' having abandoned a child with a serious mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to be domesticated, some said to have lived in the wild.
If a feral child has been raised entirely by an animal other than man, he will behave (within his physical limits) almost exactly like his pet, for example, showing similar fear or indifference toward humans.
The aim of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting, but the idea of 'scaffolding' goes even further.
Ladders are not a learning method but a tool to support individuals in a new learning experience, for example, in using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The ladder can be both virtual and real, so the teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the little paper clipboard in Microsoft Office.
The virtual ladders are built into the software and are designed to ask questions, give suggestions and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner to do without any help.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, but some do.
We're keeping the foster care system a safe haven for these kids.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, consistent education, and reliable health care.
The purpose of placing children is to provide them with all the basic conditions they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet imply additional dimensions in the context of the purpose theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are cited as important influences on Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" as new influencer perspectives when studying audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording equipment has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to judge sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two stores of genetic modification: hidden and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, selection removes it from the store of variation that has emerged.
With each generation, differentiation and recombination move the variation back and forth between these two stocks.
A handyman with a digestive system similar to that of humans has difficulty getting enough amino acids from plants available on the savannah.
Moreover, their lack has serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins from leaves and legumes, but it's difficult for primates like us to digest these without ripening.
By contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are easily digestible and provide ample protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Thus, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the deliberate awakening during a normal sleep cycle and re-entering sleep a little later (after 10 to 60 minutes).
This is easily accomplished by the use of a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but does not awaken you completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as diuretics) before bedtime, which makes you want to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force, and the possibility of finding complete peace and contentment is open to all.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that's stopping us from achieving it is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but with the addition of the concept of the mahajana, or great path, and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, including Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is the Divine Yoga, where the visualization of the Divine clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and develops the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the Soviet Union and the United States working together, and after the war, the clash of systems, practices and cultures led to a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war was real, for the proxy armies fought on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers crossed the border and created the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after attacking eastern Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that their own country retains the ability to move its own people and goods, while also interfering with the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the United States tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mostly using submarines, tried to block this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and goat meat.
Domesticated goats were usually raised in herds, which roamed the hills or other pastures, often tended by goat herders, often children or young ones, such as the more famous sheep herders, and these herding methods are still used today.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon roads consisted of only parallel wooden beams, they enabled the horses to pull the wagons faster and with greater loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day.
Early on, rails were used to hold tracks in place, but gradually it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron rail over them.
The practice became common, but iron consumed more than wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the first full-size iron rails were put into service.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans started walking upright about two million years ago, when Homo erectus evolved.
The Australopithecus that preceded it didn't walk upright as consistently.
Specialization in bipedalism is found in 4.2-3.9 million-year-old fossils of Australopithecus, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the future suffering.
This is often like treating the symptoms of a disease, but if we do not want a mere temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a great deal because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and man's wasteful way of life.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, the handwritten copy, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were printed, known today as the Dunlap Open Books.
The first public reading of the document by John Nixon took place on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th, and another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap open sheets known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document, although the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like nightmares.
They have feet with fins and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers  or bits in computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most certain sign of indoor poisoning is a visible, opened medicine can or container containing a toxic household chemical.
See the label for the first-aid instructions for the particular toxin.
This is the specific group of insects that entomologists refer to as bugs.
The term comes from the fact that in ancient times, lice were very common, and lice are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bedbugs and beetles are nest-dwellers, adapted to living in their host's nest or enclosure.
With about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or MS, in the United States, it is the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may, if they so wish, draw up an adoption plan for their minor child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing the other couple to act as the child's parents.
The main task of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works, and the scientific method guides most scientific research.
However, it is not just about doing experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek became less known in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in body structure and behavior often depend very much on the existence of innate cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not merely responses to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to rotate freely for a certain period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's study was one of the most important clues to the fact that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They performed two experiments, either by marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or by marking the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important a part of the gene they have affected, and whether they have affected germ cells or other cells.
Mutations that occur only in the germ cells can be passed on to children, and mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites to enjoy the scenery  including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities in the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and exploring information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, learning about, and photographing the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, residents of small rural towns drive to work, and they are met by others who have jobs where they left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the private car-based transport system.
Science now suggests that the vast carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed lands, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail daily, are the transport planners just incompetent, or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow, since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively uniform way, so traffic flows tend to have a fairly good consistency and can be represented in rough mathematics.
To better describe the traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps in the planning, design and maintenance of the road network.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The wolf spiders and the day-flying spiders are the only insects today that cannot fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the entire solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, and it has more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at its widest point, 6 miles.
A full 20 percent of the water on our planet that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River itself is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or construction of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City State is the world's smallest independent state and the smallest inhabited country.
The Italian language is used by the Vatican State in its legislation and official communications.
Most of the people who work in the State also speak Italian as their common language, but Latin is often used in religious services.
All inhabitants of the Vatican State are Roman Catholics.
Common chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, have been known to man since ancient times because they all occur naturally and because they are also relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a combination of one or more elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four forms of matter - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma - in the same order, but he also theorized that they change into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals, and don't forget that there are many elements in a periodic system.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also metals like gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many when it first came on the market.
Sadly, with the development of new writing systems, the value and uses of the pencil have been neglected.
Today, messages are typed on a computer screen, and the sharpener never needs to be ashed.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus, which is made up of many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill, and then splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which make them prone to break apart under little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called its crust.
The moon's crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the side visible from Earth and about 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker in the highlands.
The dark areas of the sea may be more on the visible side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are primarily concerned with what is behind or appeals to people's behavior.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at why some people want what they want and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When managers start to lead their former peers, there are generally two different behavioural patterns that can emerge: at the other end of the scale, the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or "the guys").
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, a person is shaped into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything that the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behaviour often leads to disagreements between the managers and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same quality as traditional teams, but with subtler differences.
The virtual team members act as liaisons for their immediate physical team.
They often have more decision-making power than ordinary team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones and their local management may not always understand this.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique features of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team, to which all members report, and the invisible team determines the level of demand for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently in all functional departments of the organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be generated.
As a result, a process in which the organisation works together to overcome the barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, managers must create an innovation culture and share knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a methodology used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, and therefore narrows the field of study and makes it much more exact.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The proliferation of new technologies is allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
And this gives us a lot of data and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research is the attempt to make machines perform automatically tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and hand, voice and face recognition.
These have become distinct disciplines focused on providing solutions to real problems.
Today, AI is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, just as it is embedded in many software applications for home computers and video games.
Class trips are an important part of teaching, and often a teacher would like to take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution: virtual classroom trips, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting at a desk.
Sharing a class trip online is a great way to remember it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital, and the website is updated annually, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills.In the early stages of a student's blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often careless, but the presence of an audience usually changes the situation.
Since students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them". e need to feed the interest of the readership inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to be more analytical and critical, and by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position against the background of other people's writings and bring forward their own perspective on the issue at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, with a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and further north, among other places, is pristine, scenic Muscoque.
These and many other factors create the impression that Ontario is a place that outsiders view as the paragon of Canada.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The following demographic comparison may surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than in Canada as a whole.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest of these, and its nature is like that of its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it gained a lot of air in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women  All female travellers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it does not look too valuable.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as harassment, such as following someone, grabbing their arm, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not justify sexual intimacy!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the tenth century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen, and it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar-ul-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of Morocco's least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a wide variety of rugs, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of its streets, especially in the city center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but any excursions outside the city require preliminary investigations to determine the current state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the slopes of the Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also home to some of Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla trackers.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi), which costs about 500 Congolese francs (U.S.) for a short ride.
Combined with its comparatively difficult location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city in decline, though its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 because of the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different nature reserves, each of which supports a variety of fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park charges a daily protection and admission fee, as do all South African national parks.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to either some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a major destination for many tourists.
The pattern of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to the shimmering column pattern that is best seen in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best part of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head for the Kowloon harbor area across the street.
The majority of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is located on the north shore, in a landfill built in the shape of a spit.
This is the very place that the British colonial masters took over, and if you're looking for signs of the area's colonial history, it's a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Indian part of the forest is called Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangroves. They are some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Ganges plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by wetlands or marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers and some 30,000 Aksharas.
Buses depart from the inter-county bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta and Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the buses in the area are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the counties are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and supportive.
The taxi service is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paroon (150 Nultrums) and Punakha (200 Nultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 273 feet [83 m], it is 1,900 feet [378 m] long, and it has two 12-foot [3.5 m] slabs of railings.
The bridge has a baseline height of 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian border stations are estimated to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important of the indigenous groups inhabiting the area of present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-pastoral hunters but also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Giant Nation of the Indians", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native peoples of the land in the 16th century.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted 300 years.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas pool.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
The Argentine Polo Association provides news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are the main currency used throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often used in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in the Outer Islands, although British and U.S. currencies may be accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands themselves, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, and during the summer months, temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winter can be a treacherous time of year, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air appear colder than the thermometer readings.
There are no special rainy seasons and dry seasons: the amount of rain falls remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you keep at least 100 yards/meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter from other wildlife.
Although they may look very tame, bison, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, since the smells attract bears and other wildlife, avoid bringing or preparing strong-smelling foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port experienced the infamous naval standoff of 1889, when seven ships - German, American, and British - refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
A peaceful gathering in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement led to the assassination of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a lot of sandy beaches because Auckland is between two ports, and the most popular ones are in three different areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor neighborhood) is a coastal region on the Pacific Ocean stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them have sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour at Mission Bay and St Heliers in the affluent suburb of Central Auckland.
They are sometimes busy family residences, and the shoreline is lined with a good selection of shops.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a multi-dimensional beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
There are several French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better preserved on the way.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but the cautious will easily find bottled water.
The idea of a flat white type of milk coffee is foreign to Australians, with a small black coffee known as espresso, and cappuccino served with a large amount of cream-flavored foam instead of frothed milk, and tea served without milk.
The cocoa is of Belgian standard, the fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
The reef is a popular destination for year-round recreation, and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
So heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cuban jellyfish are found north of 1770 near beaches and riverbanks from October to April, and occasionally at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and will probably swim away.
The sloths do not actually live in the sea, but their primary habitat is the river swamps north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, a traveler has the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often offer special deals on certain hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through the travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation in force if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) for your destination.
However, any changes or requests should be made first through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp in the area, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the events, you need to arrive on time to get the music near the campsite.
Remember that even after the main stage music shows have ended, there may be places at festivals where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, for the worst parts of the ice make a very awful noise.
The cruise in St. Petersburg includes time spent in the city and is visa-free (see conditions).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are usually no windows or clocks, and finding exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep customers in good spirits  and on the casino premises.
Some places offer alcohol on a complimentary basis, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is planning to drive in high latitudes or in mountainous terrain should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice or very cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and you cannot drive as you would on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that the car gets stuck.
Snowfall or snow blown by the wind, as well as moisture or ice on the windows of the vehicle, may also impair visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally runs without interruption throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps Africa's biggest draw and a highlight for many.
In common parlance, the word safari refers to a journey by road to see the magnificent wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, frequently come near cars, and ordinary equipment is well suited to observing them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, hiking safari, and hiking) is a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related cancellation policies did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with tickets usually costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry, and many hotels offer to borrow irons and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you are not particularly fond of having your socks ironed, you may want to try a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as this may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, frostbite).
There are different ways of purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are in doubt, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread poison, and spread disease.
Serious infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can violently harm or kill humans are not generally considered pests.
Tax-free purchases mean the possibility to buy products in certain places which are exempt from excise duties and sales taxes.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries may sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging of the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highways, as it repeatedly passes through remote forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: there are many steep ascents and descents, narrow lanes, and steep curves.
The speed limits imposed are considerably lower than on earlier and later sections  generally 3540 miles per hour (5664 kilometres per hour)  and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, cell phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, like the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria quite rich and varied, reminiscent of the pastries of Austria, its southern neighbour.
Fruit pies are common, apple pies are made all year round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes often taste especially good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you crave small but firm pastries, try one called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a type of food that is made with herbs and spices, either in combination with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, while in southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a superlative that covers a wide range of regional food cultures across the country.
But when used without further definition, it generally refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, and includes a large range of simply flavored dishes. Javanese favorites include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a wide variety of aromatic spices.
The soles are the riders' feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they can be associated with safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but his foot gets caught in the footrest, the escaping horse may start to pull him, and a number of precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wear a riding boot with a smooth and rather narrow bottom.
Some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety harness that allows the tread to be pulled back from the saddle by a falling rider.
Cochamón Valley  The number one climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, is a valley of various large granite walls and rock cliffs.
The summits offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes on its endless walls.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve descending from snow on skis or on a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many skiers, sometimes called ski bumpers, plan entire holidays in a particular destination around skiing.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first leisure ski resort in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called pack skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related to alpine ski-style trekking or mountaineering, but is not usually included because the latter is practiced on steep terrain and requires much more rigid skis and monos.
Think of a ski trail as a kind of hiking trail.
Under good conditions you can go somewhat faster than on foot, but you will rarely be able to keep up with the speed you would be able to ski on well-groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is home to many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean filling out visa applications and passing passport checks several times.
The Schengen area, however, acts in this respect somewhat like a single state.
As long as you remain in this area, you can usually cross the border without re-passporting.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also do not have to apply for visas for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what factory-made goods are antiques, and some tax authorities define all goods over a hundred years old as antiques.
The definition varies according to geographical location, for example, in North America, antiques are considered to be more recent than in Europe.
Handmade goods may be classified as antiques even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Deer husbandry is an important occupation for the Sámi people, and the culture associated with it is also important for many other professionals.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi people have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived off fishing, hunting and similar livelihoods, with reindeer as their main driving force.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern trades, and tourism is an important source of income in Saami.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country of visit is covered by the travel information, this may affect your travel sickness insurance and your reimbursement insurance.
Perhaps it is worth seeking advice from other nations besides your own, even though their advice is for their own citizens.
For example, Americans may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The reports are just brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, generalized and oversimplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Hazardous weather is a general term for all hazardous weather events that may cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Hazardous weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types that can be caused by geography, landforms and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, heavy rain, heavy rainfall and wildfires are forms and effects of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, hurricanes, floods and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather events include snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of dangerous weather affecting the destination, as it may affect travel plans.
All those who wish to visit a country that could be interpreted as a war zone should receive vocational training.
An Internet search for the term "Hostile Environment Course" will likely return the address of a local business.
The course usually covers all the subjects covered in this section in much more detail and usually combined with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of the authorities to issue passports without an X or to update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not had surgery should not expect to survive security scans while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Backflow is the return flow of waves that break off the shore, often found on reefs or similar places.
Because of the underwater surface features, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper parts, where a fast flow into deep water can be formed.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the water, swimming back in isn't any harder than it used to be.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be swept away again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it may be wise to wait for rescuers.
The return shock is earlier than the culture shock (the period of adjustment is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time adjusting back to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture's customs.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new land.
What people may not realize is that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children to see in the area.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the show begins, they can be seen in complete silence.
You usually hear the voices of travelers and merchants, and the story of light and sound is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is the background to a long story and the narrator of it.
The scenes are shown against the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Many states have claimed the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, as the most heavily fortified base in the world, with 16 active bases in 2020.
The largest is King George Island, which is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the crater of a still-active volcano, filled with water, serves as a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea in the southern part of the peninsula.
There the mountains of Nijmegen merge into the plain and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, the Sentinel Mountains are home to the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Range, with its highest peak, Mount Vinson, at 16,550 feet [4,892 m].
In remote areas where mobile phone coverage is limited, satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, since to make a call you have to be outside and have an unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is used frequently by maritime transport, including leisure craft, as well as by excursion groups requiring remote data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider will probably be able to provide you with further information on how to connect to that service.
Travel and learning is becoming an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
It is especially popular among school leavers because they can take a year off before university without having their education suffer.
In many cases, attending a gap year course abroad may even improve the chances of continuing higher education in your own country.
Typically, these courses are subject to a tuition fee.
Finland is a great destination for boating, and the land of thousands of lakes also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
On islands and lakes, you may not need a boat the size of a cat.
While the coastal islands and the larger lakes are large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a common leisure activity in Finland, where boats are found in every seventh or eighth person.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in 40).
Most actual Baltic Sea cruises include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few days and still return to the ship for the night to sleep.
You do not need a separate visa if you only visit the country on excursions organised by a ship (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany, and as you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown or experienced anything traumatic before.
It is nothing to be ashamed of; it is no different from the fears and disgust of many other people for some other things.
For some, some insight into the operation of an airplane and what happens during flight may help to overcome the fear of ignorance or a feeling of helplessness.
Transport companies are well paid for fast delivery, and often speed is very important for company documents, merchandise or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own planes on some routes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent goods by air, then on some routes unloading and clearing could take days.
The only way to get the goods through faster was to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so at this point, we need you.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large chunk of money for this privilege (or perhaps prefer to let your company do it for you).
But it's not cheap: the rough rule of thumb is that you can expect to pay up to four times as much for business class as for economy, and eleven times as much for first class!
On direct flights from A to B, it is generally not worth even looking for discounts on business or first class seats.
Airlines know that there is a certain core group of air travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic which has suffered from ethnic conflict.
The conflict led to the declaration of independence in 1994 of the Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
The economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port in the country after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Today, the ancient city of Smyrna is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, surrounded by mountains and spread out around a huge bay.
The city's wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-brick roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere is more Mediterranean than traditional Turkish.

ScottUrb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, you should also visit the large Sanctuary of the Virgin of Fatima, world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Remember, you are, in effect, visiting a mass grave and a site of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the earth's population.
Many men and women who survived there are still alive, and many others whose loved ones were murdered there or forced to toil there to their deaths, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Remember to treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, and don't make fun of the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't ruin the place by drawing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish, and about half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understands it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, since it is the first official language by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
The metro's normal announcements are only in Catalan, but the automatic system notifies of unexpected disturbances in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although often a misplaced stereotype, the best way to get around Paris is to be as decent as possible and to behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred), which makes getting around much easier.
The rude exterior of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show them the usual courtesy.
Plitvice National Park is heavily forested, mainly with spruce, fir, and pine trees, and its vegetation is a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities due to the variety of microclimates, varied soils and altitude differences.
The area is also home to an extraordinary variety of animal and bird species.
Along with more common species, you can find rare animals, such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, hippos, wild cats, and mongooses
Women visiting monasteries must wear skirts that cover the knees, and shoulders must also be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially a bright one, you may get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men need to wear trousers that reach below the knee.
You can borrow these from the entrance wardrobe, but they don't wash after every use, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.
Like similar cuisines in the Mediterranean, the cuisine of Mallorca is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), all of which is olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes and any available accompaniment, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, and in addition the word "you" or "you", always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to separate some verbs from objects.
It can also make reading easier, although writing is complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters C and G deserve the most attention, for their pronunciation depends on the next vowel.
And remember, the r and the rr are pronounced differently.
Persian grammar is fairly easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help you to learn many things about Persian grammar and improve your understanding of sentences.
Needless to say, if you know some Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, those who know little Spanish may suddenly imagine that Portuguese is so close that it would not be necessary to study it separately.
Today, old-fashioned observatories are generally not used for their original purpose, but have been converted into museums or learning environments.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses and are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations, and they are located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The idea came from China, where the most popular flower was the Japanese apricot.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom festivals only for himself and other members of the influential aristocracy of the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take just "one" sample.
If you go into a formal and maintained garden, you will fly out of the "sample" collection without any but.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay, and it is very easy to find your way around.
But when you are in the heart of the tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to endure both the heat (always) and the intense sunshine (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
In addition, some buses travel north to Hebron, traditionally the burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are about to board also goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to plan a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to the fortified towns along the Danube or taking a boat trip on the Erie Canal.
They also guide the popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated on the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers and non-Christians in Christian lands around the world have also adopted many traditions associated with the celebration.
Traditionally, Easter is spent awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often deliver the Mass of the Easter Vigil on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, and the congregation often breaks out at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island came by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, the mammals could not survive the journey, so the giant tortoise became the principal herbivore of the Galapagos.
Since man arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs, have been introduced.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a "camo" when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It provides a good opportunity to see the aurora because the sky is dark for about 24 hours.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore not a problem, you can also admire the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may have been accustomed to.
The uniform is standard workwear, and colleagues call each other by surname or title.
The workplace is a place where harmony is paramount, where the emphasis is on teamwork rather than individual achievement.
Often, employees must have the approval of their supervisor for all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey the supervisor's instructions to the letter.
