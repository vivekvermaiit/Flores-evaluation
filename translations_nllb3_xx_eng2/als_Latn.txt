This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but provides details that cannot usually be provided by fossils, such as color and three-dimensional presentation.
According to scientists, the animal had brown feathers on its upper body and pale feathers or carotenoids on its lower body.
This discovery also gives us a glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft called a rachis but share other features, such as spines and whiskers, with the structure of modern feathers, the researchers concluded that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for regulating temperature or for appearance. The researchers believe that the example shows a full-grown feather, not a bird's beak, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur.
The researchers reasoned that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows a mature feather rather than a small bird's beak.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning in the police district of Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty others.

They discovered that the Sun's functioning is based on the same fundamental principles as other stars, and their conclusions showed that the activity in all the stars in the system was guided by their brightness and rotation and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the number of Rossby stars that are associated with the flow of the plasma.
The smaller the value of the Rossby number (Ro), the less active the star is in reversing the polarity of its magnetic field.

The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He warns that no one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this point will stop sectarian conflict, rising violence or an acceleration of chaos.
The report begins with a plea for open debate and consensus in the U.S. on Middle East policy.
The report is overly critical of almost every aspect of the current policy toward Iraq by the executive branch and calls for an immediate change in that direction.
First among its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative be undertaken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders from hostile interference, as well as to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work was largely theoretical, although the program was designed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by the interstellar forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts gravitational pull on the Earth and causes thunderstorms, so the Milky Way exerts a pull on the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in the form of a halo around the galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Molli believes, and at least two were hospital health workers.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters self-isolate in a booth and slip a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope to determine the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be visible so that voters and observers can prove that there are no envelopes in them before voting begins and that no envelopes are added except those of duly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives as witnesses to any part of the process.

In her next competition, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group, with a combined walking time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than first-place finisher Claudia Lash of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place finisher Giongi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's downhill ski category failed to finish their race and 45 of the 117 skiers in total of the Alpine World Ski Championships failed to qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss citizen and found her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekar Solanki said the accused arrived in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been charged with murdering her son in the Edinburgh Magistrates' Court.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be corrupted because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice found in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of the photographs as potentially prejudicial to the case.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous path if they publish photos and so on of suspects".
The Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for all criminal prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is announced.
According to reports, the document will refer to the opposition to the borders, which Palestine wants according to the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered are thought to include the future state of Jerusalem that is sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, until the signing of this agreement, demands to have a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian authorities agree to allow their presence for only five years.
The shooters had to be closely monitored by guards during the additional pest control test, after the test was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Clays Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Clays Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director for Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have been given extended instructions on their safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Interim Electoral Council for Martell in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been expected since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing six fires in total and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been made aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced last week that Apple had reported 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "very serious".
The ministry reacted by calling Apple's delay in the report "really unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 p.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 a.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no injuries were reported at the site.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were the first to be released, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began work at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs in infants.
Xinhua reported that state investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
You've also received compliments from your fellow fighters.
Tom Dreamer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager. Luna died the night of the two moons. Rare enough, like herself. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldie" Runnels commented that, "The moon was as strange as I am... maybe even more so... I love it and will miss it... I hope it's in a better place".
In a poll of 1,400 people ahead of the 2010 federal election, opponents of Australia's return to a republic have risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed the state of Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, according to which they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the survey's extreme responses, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100- and 200-meter freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his fitness has been precarious.
He has not been able to take the proper medication to beat his pain, as they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, mathematician and computer science professor Kurtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by many people using various devices and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water, along with organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially how the Earth was formed by long-ago cometary collisions.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate the aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transportation will be provided and no overhead trains will stop at Wembley, and car parking facilities, as well as parking and travel, are not available to the playground.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take longer, due to crossbreeding between an endemic Darwinian tristillate, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus tristillate, Geospiza conirostris.
The florin can be worked into any shape, it can be coated into fine forms.
It can be pulled into thin wire, which can then be twisted and pierced. It can be hammered or laminated into sheet metal.
It could be extremely thin and bonded to other metals, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can prepare a gauge using red lacquer liquid.
The lacquer solution changes color depending on the acid or base (alkaline) level of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H of pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of an electron and a proton).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with wet, clean hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give it a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every dwelling, connected to a rather elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets in Roman civilization were sometimes part of mixed public baths for men and women.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and then returns it back to us almost instantly.
Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has brought to us is that it has provided us with a much faster and much easier mode of transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are larger-than-average cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
As a result, many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) eat much more small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the comfort corner, a special feature that every cat has that does not allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called herds.
Flocks consist of one to three adult related males, along with up to thirty females and pups.
Women, being part of a large family of sisters and sons, generally have closer relationships with one another.
Lionsherds behave like wolf or dog packs, animals with behavior eerily similar to that of lions (but not other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
Like a well-trained athlete, a tiger can climb (though not so well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is in a group with lions, leopards and jaguars, the only four cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion but is more like a phrase of words with a roar and a shout.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals, and when they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds - almost all of which are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find animals (their prey) through the wind, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and move very stealthily as well.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they go to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than a previously necessary competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans absorb and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We build houses with plants, we make clothes with plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the supergrabber of his day, so he feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with over 70 sharp, brisk teeth, along with an additional set of teeth in the jaw, meaning that nothing that got in its way escaped it.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a tongue like a pike, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other non-asaurids, and he may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex could not defeat it.
Although most of their food would be familiar, the Romans had many strange or unusual items for celebrations, including wild boar, pallois, snails, and a type of rodent called a weasel.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals seated on benches, the rich men enjoyed eating together at banquets, where they ate their meals lying on their backs in the grass.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that came from the Americas or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
They had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, for example, and no ancient Roman ever tasted seafood.
The Babylonians built a principal temple, called the house of the god, for each of their gods.
The people brought the gods their beds, and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through festivals and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
Housing was not so important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Jewish family life was largely outdoor.
Women made their yarn in the courtyard; shops were simply open arcades with views of the street.
The land of Canaan was sparsely forested, so the source of timber was extremely expensive.
In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, on his travels westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time despite his discovery.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, and customs of the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that behind the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bore the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the end of this document, written backwards.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was assembled as a roll for preservation.
For this reason, it is possible that the mark was put on only as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south still remained occupied.
It was ruled by the French of the Vichy regime, who in 1940 had chosen to make peace with the Germans and had collaborated with the occupiers rather than fight them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragon".
Within two weeks, American and French liberation forces had liberated southern France and were advancing on Germany.
Civilization is a distinct and shared culture of a fairly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "civil", which is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", which in a way also determines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of states. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a continuous cultural footprint and a fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen colonies first created a weak central government - with Congress as its sole structure - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, lacking a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor did he have the authority to overrule the laws of taxation and fees between states.
Articles required unanimous approval by all states before they could be changed, and they took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and, in 2006, were the champions of the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, starting with Italians competing in both international games and Olympic activities.
Japan contains nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's grouping of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa", or "beautiful island".
The Dutch East India Company establishes a base in Southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of local grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on its sugar rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the coastal areas to the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main buildings, namely: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they looked like originally.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the tail end of the analog film era.
It continues to be produced today, and above all in the same formats inherited from the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35 mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) thus comes out to 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by maintaining a degree of order in an image.
He determines that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, was being watched with a critical eye.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had bound the nations of Europe together, despite differences in language and customs.
His power was felt everywhere, affecting everyone from the king to the common people.
One of Christianity's central tenets is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that church funds are there specifically for that purpose.
The main organs of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being applied.
Soon after the start of the military fighting, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to block all shipping access to entire stretches of ocean, endangering even innocent shipping.
Since reaction to this tactic was meager, Germany hoped for a similar reaction to its submarine warfare without borders.
The dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations during the 1920's were pacifism and isolationism.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents in his account, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a rare way of telling different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power was a known dynasty.
Also, between each of the dynasties there was a period of instability with separate provinces. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms era that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war was fought between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The "Three Kingdoms" was one of the bloodiest periods of ancient Chinese history, in which thousands died in the battle for the highest office in the great palace at Xian.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were also opened to all male applicants, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This is true of the military too because instead of being based on rank, military ranks were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was most interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Nur" (light).
The very guva that has survived the test of time gives a very vivid reflection of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
This cave, located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it's there.
You can see nothing but a clear, beautiful sky above you and the many mountains that surround you, and from inside the cave you can see or hear only a little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper arch" sign looks like a V and the "lower arch" sign like a wire catch or like a square without the lower edge.
"Up" means you have to start at the top and push the bow, and "down" means you have to start at the ring (which is where the hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper arch generally produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and more stable.
You may keep your notes, but remember that the printed arcs are there for musical purposes, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of merchants.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who were shouting and barking threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their chariot wide open.
In an instant, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of the war of American imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds was floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super profits realized from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main gains of American imperialism.
One must understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the order to understand the Templars.
The era when the events occurred is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the technological urge or necessity of technology to the narrow understanding that human destiny is guided by a basic logic that relates to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two main ideas in common: that technological development goes itself in a way beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology on the other hand has "impacts" on societies that are natural, unconditioned socially.
One might say, for example, that the automobile leads to improvements in roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a small number of vehicles, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of vehicles also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a pronounced element of cultural determinism, brought on by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography blurred the personality, and in time customs and cultures associated with that geography arose, and, since they were in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is noted as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were valued above what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the transfer of the title of the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was also carried out.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of the time that came as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use tassels to tie their clothes.
Existential agriculture is agriculture that is practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family alone.
Existential agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses native seeds combined through crop rotation or with other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield enhancement.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and the situation remains the same in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the ethnicity, age, location, class, and/or gender of the members.
The distinguishing criteria of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographical, or a mixture of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their membership by using in a distinctive and symbolic way the style that includes fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on some unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, accidents, or intentional abuse, were not socialized with adults during their upbringing.
Some feral children are confined by humans (usually by their parents); this abandonment of the child was in some cases due to the parent's disapproval of the child's severe intellectual or physical disorder.
Wild children may have been victims of severe child abuse or trauma prior to abandonment or removal.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the feral child manifests behavior (within physical limits) almost completely identical to that of the particular caretaker animal, such as its fear or indifference to people.
While the project-based learning method should make learning easier and more interesting, Scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but, rather, a support tool that provides support to people undergoing a new experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scales can be virtual and real, meaning a teacher is a kind of scales, but so is the little man in the form of a Microsoft Office letter opener.
Virtual skeletons are taken over by software and are intended to investigate, encourage and explain procedures that the learner may have had difficulty handling on their own.
Children are sent to children's homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should grow up, under any circumstances, in an environment that is not encouraging, loving and educational, but they are growing up that way.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide loving caregivers, safe homes, safe health care, and continuing education.
The caretaker is supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the home they were in before.
The Internet combines both mass and interpersonal elements of communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to other dimensions regarding access for uses and pleasures.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important incentives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they observed how audiences reacted to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in explaining microexpressions and facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a man is lying by accurately interpreting his facial expressions.
In his commentary "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks showed how persons who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even thought that such abilities to explain human behavior might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have proved that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection removes it from the group of expressed variants.
Separation and recombination mix variation repeatedly between the two groups with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans has difficulty meeting its amino acid needs through the plant resources of the savannah.
Failure to do so also has dire consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would be proteins obtained from leaves and tails, but primates like us have a hard time digesting them unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (milk thistles, termites, eggs) not only are easily digested but also provide large amounts of protein that has all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively low-volume alarm clock to bring you to your senses without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock to sleep, you can set it across the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking enough fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime to force someone to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person has is in direct proportion to the level of tension in his body and soul.
As tension is reduced, the actual life force is increased, and each individual has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was further enriched by the theological thought of the Mahayana "way of love" and more Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, through the visual representation of several deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, bringing cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process and culture led to the states' quarrel.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies, and so the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years and be fought in real time, by authorized armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian capital.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after the invasion of the regions of Eastern Poland, violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is currently the most efficient way to move large amounts of goods and people across the ocean.
The task of the naval fleet has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while, at the same time, interfering with the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans were trying to move people and material across the Atlantic to come to the aid of Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet was trying to stop the traffic by using submarines primarily.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have succeeded in conquering Britain, as it had done with other countries of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often under the care of goatherds who were usually children or teenagers, more or less identical to the better-known shepherds.
Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them for greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat more difficult roads of the time.
The traverse was introduced early enough to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a sheet of iron over them.
This became common practice, but the iron consumed more of the wagons' wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first all-iron signs were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began walking two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning man on foot).
Their ancestors, the australopithecus, did not walk normally.
Adaptations for bipedal walking have been found in australopithecine fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is the same as treating the symptoms, but we must find the cause of the problem and disable it if we want only a temporary solution.
It is abundantly clear that the world has undergone great changes because of mankind's advances in science and technology, and problems have been added because of overpopulation and mankind's extravagant way of life.
After its approval on July 4 by Congress, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printer.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies of what are now known as the Dunlap Flats were made.
The first public reading of the document was on July 8 by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it on July 9 before his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap tracts known to exist to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they're feathered and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have spiny feet and scales, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and, in computer language, these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as nausea are common enough to allow an immediate diagnosis.
The presence of an open can of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the most obvious sign of intoxication.
Look at the label for the specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term "candrus" in its formal sense.
The term originates from the ancient similarity of bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Like insect killers, bed bugs are nidicols, adapted to live in the nest or shelter of their host.
Across the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most important neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to prepare an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and this method actually drives most of the scientific research.
But it is not the only one; scientific inquiry is also guided by experimentation, and experimentation is the test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on every scientific subject, including psychology.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms related to physiology and behavior often depend primarily on the presence of endogenous cycles as well as their production by biological clocks.
For the vast majority of living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, rhythms have been documented that are more than just reactions to external signals.
The biological clock is an independent oscillator that will continue a period of free-moving cycles, even when external signals are absent.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments in which they labeled bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only cell mutations from the germ line can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in going to natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of field activities include fishing, hunting, photography, bird watching, park visits, and the study of information about the ecosystem.
One example is the development of visits, photography and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the cities by car to go to their workplace and pass other people whose work destination is the country they have just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth movement of transportation, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Now science shows that the massive carbon-based economy has caused the biosphere to shift from one of its stable states that has underpinned human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a participant in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about transportation systems.
In developed lands, there are rarely so many complaints about the quality of water or about collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such frustration, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic motion is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a fixed time interval; therefore, traffic flows can be calculated mathematically by approximation.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This coordination helps in the planning, design and use of road facilities.
In animals, insects were the first to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to evade their predators more easily and to find food and to breed more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back to the length of their body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to flee from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings back are the firefly and the moth.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars), moved around the earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on earth and the first widest, with eight times as much water flowing through it as the second longest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, six miles wide in some cases.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors that were at that time much older than a thousand years.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in its official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most of those working in the state, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known since antiquity about such basic chemical elements as gold, silver, and copper, since all of these can be detected in nature in their original form and are relatively easily mined by primitive means.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements - earth, air, water, and fire.
This more closely resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new matter to create whatever we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are, of course, metals like silver and gold.
You can also combine alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit the dots at the end of this sentence.
Thus, with his invention, the pencil became a good companion for many.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil's status and uses declined.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to use a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes out.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that the fusion of several protons and neutrons into a nucleus requires energy.
Like lifting a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus from the top releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to split spontaneously or with the slightest disturbance.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side of the moon.
It is thinner under the dark maria and thicker under the mountainous areas.
There may be more lakes on the near side because the crust is thinner, and the lava was easier to lift to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people choose or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they hold onto as they go through adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes some people want the things they want and what things in their environment will or will not make them do certain things.
Two popular theories for content are Maslov's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers take on their former colleagues: One side of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unusual decisions, imposing disciplinary measures, making performance appraisals, assigning duties and responsibilities to everyone.
On the other end of the spectrum, one easily becomes an outsider who thinks he or she has to change everything the team has done and own it.
After all, the leader bears ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure.
Often, this behavior causes friction between managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their live physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administration.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating an educational organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional sectors of an organization, creativity and skill can emerge.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to overcome a bottleneck can lead to a process of re-invention to serve the customer's need.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as the sharing of knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical treatment of cognitive research, and as a result, they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The reciprocal link between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although AI has taken on strong overtones in the science fiction literature, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, programming planning, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have turned into special disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the field of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it has been incorporated into some software applications of personal computers and video games.
Excursions take up a large part of any teaching methodology. It is often the case that a teacher expresses a desire to send her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers virtual field trips, where students can visit museum artifacts, view an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Virtual fieldwork is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website dedicated to their trip to the capital, this website is modified every year, but the old versions are still stored online as a memory block.
Blogs can also help improve the way students write.While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger makes efforts to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more thoughtful about the world around them". The need to nurture the interests of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand knowledge beyond their traditional school day.
Using blogs in the right way "can help students become more critical and analytical. Through active responses to online materials, students can define their positions regarding the writings of others as well as define their own views regarding particular issues".
Ottawa is Canada's bilingual capital of attraction, with a series of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and many more present Ontario with elements that are considered by outsiders to be most typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost deserted and uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands and it had a great influence on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It helps even if you bring a ring (not just one that looks expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they consider harassment and stalking, arm grabbing, etc. is not uncommon.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (even if it's because of cultural differences, it's not okay!).
The contemporary city of Casablanca was founded by Imazighen fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meronids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badia and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find stores selling traditional Moroccan products such as: cutlery, ceramics, leather goods, daffodils, and a whole range of ornaments, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the volcano Niragongo that covered most of the city streets and in particular the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, you should research for any visit outside Goma to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Niragongo volcano along with some of the lowest cost mountain gorilla pursuits in Africa.
You can use the boda-bodan (motor-taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is approximately 500 CFR for the short trip.
Combined with its unreachable and unforgiving nature, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for far-off exotic places.
Timbuktu is today an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990, due to the danger from desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special broadcast for the Public Broadcasting Service "Wonders of the African World".
The city has a strong contrast with the rest of the cities in this country, because it has more of an Arab style than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is called the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks in South Africa, the park has daily fees for entry and maintenance.
You may also be able to purchase a "Wild Card", which provides access to any of South Africa's selected parks or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place considered the main destination by many tourists.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a ribbon-cutting graph highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon pier opposite.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on a reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the land that was appropriated by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal belt of rice paddies in the entire world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the inland Bengal and Indian coastline.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest in the Indian part is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just swamps of rhizophores, they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the plain of northern India.
The sovereign state covers an area of 3850 km2, approximately one third of which is covered by water/sea surfaces.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a haven for wildlife and it is estimated that the area now has 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those travelling east and Jakarta/Bumthang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance, as intercity buses often fill up.
Most provinces are served by the comfortable and powerful Japanese minibus Coaster.
Taking taxis together is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Ojapó River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Ojapó River to connect the cities of Ojapó in Brazil and Saint George of Ojapó in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was created as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' confrontation with the indigenous local groups.
The Spanish were the ones who started the colonization period, a period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of the Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polo matches, go to the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the pound sterling (FKP), whose value is set equal to that of one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange your money at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will be generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted within Stanley.
In outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted. Consult with owners in advance to determine what payment methods are accepted.
Outside the islands, it is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency, so break your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, and in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can have a chill to it: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and moisture combine to make it appear colder than it is colder than the temperature on the thermometer.
There is no particularly "rainy" and "dry" season: the rainfall level is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, you should stay at least 100 yards [30 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] away from all other wildlife!
No matter how clever they may appear, bison, deer, bald eagles, bears, and almost any large animal can attack you.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these are wild, large, and potentially dangerous animals, and that's why you need to give them the space they need.
Additionally, be aware that the scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid keeping or cooking scented food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia, founded in the 1850's, has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, with the loss of approximately 200 American and German lives.
During independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful uprising in the city brought about the assassination of the main Tupua leader Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because of the stretch of Auckland between the two ports.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north and to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy and safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukaua trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Street are in the Port of Waitemata, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Helier in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded with a multitude of shops lined up along the shore.
The main beer in the country is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and pleasant. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand wines and Australian wines may be more readily available.
The water from the local tap is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are afraid.
To Australians, the idea of a "just white" coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an "express", the cappuccino is served covered in cream (rather than foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is by Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
Many trips are made on the tire throughout the year, and damage to the tire from any of these causes is rare.
But still, follow the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Kubozoa sea candles appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of the bay, 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking helps the traveler to remember that there will be a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Often, travel agents have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find that it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also reserve the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to provide other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants decide to camp in the same place, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember, even though the music may have ended on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic during winter, check where your cabin is located, as movement on the ice causes a very awful noise for those who are most sensitive.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and in their quarters.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving a vehicle over large geographical latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is minimal, and you cannot drive as if you were on clear asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that it can become trapped.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowstorm or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many places, and traffic generally runs uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the main attraction of tourism in Africa and the highlight of many visitors' lives.
The term safari, in common usage, refers to trips on land to view the wild and amazing life of Africa, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, usually get close to cars, and with standard equipment, you can get a better view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shaded, so they are best seen with an owl.
A walking safari (also called a " bushwalk", "walking safari", or "walking" tour) consists of walking for several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the postponement was announced, you may be in a messy situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
It is expected that the bulk of the event tickets will be priced from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with typical tickets priced around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing tables available for rent, even if there is none in the room.
If you do not have a cast iron or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you may try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them in their region of residence.
Parasites can damage food, cause skin irritation, or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases in themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force do not generally qualify as harmful.
Duty-free shopping is a case for buying goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in some countries.
Travelers headed to high-tax states can occasionally save a considerable amount of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road segment between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult conditions of vehicle driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often traversing isolated terrain of virgin forests.
If you are new to driving on country roads, keep your mind on the road: sharp swords, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than on the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/ h) - and full compliance with them is even more important than under other circumstances.
Surprisingly, cell service is much stronger here than along other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pies are very good, and in Bavaria they are as varied and diverse as those of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, ranging from apple pies that are cooked year-round to summer dumplings.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, milk, and other dried fruits.
If you want some small but rich desserts, try those called berliner, pfannkushen, or krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "liquid", depending on the amount of liquid.
In curry, coconut milk is generally used in the inland provinces of North India and Pakistan; in South India and some other coastal provinces of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catchall term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But the term is intended to mean foods originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island of Java in case it is used without other qualities.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, has a range of simple spicy dishes, with the predominant flavorings that Javanese like being: peanuts, burnt spices, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and some aromatic spices.
The stars are supports for the rider's legs that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but can be a safety problem due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but has his foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged back if the horse leaves.
First, most motorcyclists wear boots with very tight, polished heels and soles.
Then, some shawls, especially English shawls, have safety straps that allow the star belt to fall off the shawl if it is pulled back by the falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier mountaineering destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
The mountains include breathtaking views from the ridges. Alpinists from every corner of the world are constantly trying new routes between its pages of endless possibilities.
Hilltop snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding across snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a widespread travel activity with many admirers, formerly known as "ski nomads", whose sole purpose of vacation is to get the skier to a certain place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
As a sport, alpine skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first ski training club in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski excursion.
It is related to, but does not usually include alpine-style skiing or alpinism, where the latter are developed on steep terrain and require much stronger skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as a similar walking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than by walking, but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the cleared slopes.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent states. Under normal conditions, travel to many countries would require visa applications and numerous passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you do not leave this area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money and documents.
There is no general definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.
This definition varies geographically, where the threshold of seniority may be lower in countries like North America compared to Europe.
Craft products may be called antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding (northern drer) is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture around trade is also important to many people with other professions.
Although traditionally the Sami were not all involved to a large extent in reindeer herding, they did live off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern crafts, and tourism is a major source of income in Sapmi, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is commonly considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma population.
If a travel recommendation is made for the country you are going to, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but it is programmed for their citizens.
To give one example, American citizens may encounter circumstances in the Middle East that are different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory notices are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified compared with the more detailed information given elsewhere.
"Hard weather" is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious disruption of social life or loss of human life.
Rough weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it that can be conditioned by geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The forms and effects of severe weather are strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, water columns, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather conditions include thunderstorms, snowstorms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather hazards affecting their area, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be called a war zone needs to be professionally trained.
A search on the Internet for "Hostile Environments Course" may lead you to the address of a local association.
A course will normally deal in much more detail with all the issues discussed here, generally with practical experience.
A course will be regularly from 2-5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with desert survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender declaration (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents also varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, security checks at checkpoints became much more intrusive.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to pass through the scans without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Coastal currents are the backflow of waves that leave the coast, often in a rubber or similar form.
The underwater topology causes the return flow to concentrate in some deeper parts and there a fast current towards the sea depth can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while trying to swim backwards against the current, which may be impossible.
But to get out of the current, the return leg is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your abilities and if you've been spotted, it might be better to wait for rescue.
The reciprocal cultural mate occurs faster than the cultural mate (there is a shorter phase of the honeymoon), lasts longer and can be heavier.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after your life abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs from your home country's culture.
When you first went abroad, people may have been patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not expect that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The pyramid's light and sound display is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
Before the show begins, you can see the pyramids in silence and darkness.
Usually you always hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is exactly like a book of stories.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
The images appear on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have more bases there, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Vila-Las-Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled caldera of a still-active volcano provides an impressive natural harbor.
Elsuorth Land is the region in the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Belingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains join here in the plateau and then reappear to form a 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are separated by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Ranges have Antarctica's highest mountains, Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Mount Vinson at 4892 m (19,030 ft).
In isolated places where there is no cell phone signal, satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite telephony cannot replace the mobile phone in general, that you have to be out in the open with an unobstructed line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as by expeditions that need remote data and voice calls.
Your local telephone service provider may provide additional information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a sabbatical year is travel and study.
This is especially preferred by school dropouts, which allows them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical year course abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education when you return home.
In general, enrollment in these educational programs will require a tuition fee.
Finland is a great sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on these lakes and archipelagos.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is considered a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, apart from them, it is something quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).
Most of the special cruises to the Baltic have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several full days while returning and spending the night on the ship.
If you go to the coast only on boat excursions, you will not need a special visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise lines in their brochures feature the German city of Berlin. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, so a visit to this city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying by air can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that many, many people have.
For some, some knowledge of how an airplane works and what happens on a flight can help them to overcome fear of the unknown or of things not being under control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important for working papers, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some lines, the larger companies have their own planes, but it was a problem for other lines and smaller companies.
If they were to send the goods by air, some routes could take days to clear and unload.
The only way to get through this faster would be to check in as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow baggage to be checked in without passengers, and that's your job.
The easiest way to fly first or business class is to raise a large sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, have the company do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as a general rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and eleven times for first class!
Usually, it is not even worth asking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a select handful of passengers who willingly pay high prices for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, and they set prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the official language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
This conflict led to the creation in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religious faith in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a fairly good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it has now become a bustling, modern, and developed commercial center, situated on a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Scattered among the wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are the traditional red-brick roofs, the 18th-century marketplace, and the old church mosque, although the atmosphere of the city is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eisturoi and has a curious octagonal church.
Above the tombs of the church yard, there are some interesting sculptures, in the form of pigeons, made of marble.
It's worth a half-hour stroll through the intrigue village.
To the north and very nearby is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became famous to outsiders after a vividly colored account of its beauties was written by Lord Byron.

Do not damage the appearance of the object by making notes or graffiti on these structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
Regular metro announcements are made only in Catalan, but for unplanned stops, announcements are made by an automated system in a multitude of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, harsh, and arrogant.
Although this is often an incorrect stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as best you can, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-educated).
The harsh exterior of Parisians will soon soften if you display a few basic good manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forests, mainly of oak, coniferous and broadleaf pine, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, unique soils and varying elevation levels.
The region is also home to a staggering number of animal and bird species.
There you can find such rare wildlife as the European grizzly bear, the wolf, the eagle, the cuckoo, the hedgehog, the wildcat, and the wild rooster, along with many more common species.
When entering the monastery, women must wear a tunic below the knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries offer a headscarf for women who do not come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one of bright colors, you will win a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the spare trousers at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after every user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these wide trousers.
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil entirely.
A typical simple dinner of the area, especially during the summer, is "Pa amb Oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any other ingredients available such as cheese, tuna etc.
All names next to the word "Sie", which means "you", always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some sayings from opposing ones.
It also makes reading undeniably easier, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to detect whether a verb or a surname is used in substantiated form.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are the c and the g, as their pronunciation varies with the subsequent sound.
Also, make sure you pronounce the r and rr differently: "caro" means dear, and "carro" means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, if you read this practical grammar, you will be able to learn much about Persian grammar and better understand its expressions.
Needless to say, if you have a command of a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is too similar for them to study on their own.
The medieval observatories are now mostly decommissioned and used as museums and educational facilities.
Since light pollution in their day was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, where they are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern survey telescopes are very large objects in special areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom viewing known as hanami has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The notion came from China where the favorite flower was the carnation.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look much better when they are in their natural environment, so do not be tempted to remove them like a "lone" champion.
If you visit a properly maintained garden, even the collection of "samples" will automatically get you out.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe and very easy place to move around, and you can buy almost anything when you get there.
But since it is located in the "northern tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with either steam (always) or strong sun (rarely, when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you intend to take goes inside Hebron, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat-Arabia.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to provide the base for holidays around them.
For example, by visiting the Loire Valley fortress, the Rhine Valley or by cruising to interesting places on the Danube or sailing along the Ir Canal.
They also set routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been adopted by non-Christians in Christian lands and by non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual for spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into festivities as soon as midnight falls to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally reached the islands came here by swimming, flying, or burrowing.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
After humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals, including horses, cows, goats, cats, dogs, and mice, also arrived.
If you visit Antarctica or the Arctic during winter, you will enjoy the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to watch the polar dawn, as the sky will be dark almost all the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, visual pollution is easy and usually not a problem, so you will be able to enjoy the stars too.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
The costumes are standard business attire, and colleagues call each other by their surnames or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, putting the emphasis on the efforts of the group, rather than the praise of individual achievements.
Often, employees must get their superiors' approval for every decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
