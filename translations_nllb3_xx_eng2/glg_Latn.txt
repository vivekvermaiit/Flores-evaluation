It was in late 2017 when Siminoff appeared on the television shopping channel QVC.
Ring also reached an out-of-court settlement with a competing security firm, ADT Corporation.
Although evidence suggests that an experimental vaccine is able to reduce mortality from Ebola, to date, no drug has clearly demonstrated its ability to treat this infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promising results in this area, but other formal studies suggested that it had less of a benefit than expected in preventing mortality.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other drugs to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the imperative need for the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, could be better served by looking to the future with a significant change within our organization, rather than withdrawal of certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how abuses of the dimensions so boldly described by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone unnoticed for so long and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics as a sport, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that female athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowered environment.
It was during the 1960s that Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and, later, for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
During the 1976 election, he advised Carter on foreign policy and later worked as National Security Advisor (NSA) between 1977 and 1981, as successor to Henry Kissinger.

This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a widely held theory) and provides other data that fossils generally do not provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the animal's feathers were brown at the top and pale or carotenoid at the bottom.
The find also offers insight into how feathers evolved in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed barrel, called a spindle, but do have other feather characteristics (beards and barbels), researchers have deduced that the spindle likely represents a later evolution of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or as ornamentation. The researchers suggested that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has adult plumage and is not the plumage of a young child.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has adult plumage and is not the plumage of a young child.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

They found that the Sun follows the same basic principles as the rest of the stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system is governed by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a stellar Rossby number, related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less activity the star will have in relation to the magnetic reversals.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts its attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke rising from the plant.
Local authorities are warning residents near the plant to stay indoors, turn off the air conditioning and not drink tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant was "extremely worrying and cause for alarm, due to its extremely high mortality rate".
It's possible that some patients contracted the disease in the hospital, in Dr. Moll's opinion, and at least two of them were health care workers there.
After a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 of their immediate contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total TB group still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared imaging shows that the temperature variations between night and day indicate that these are likely caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the Earth's large caves, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is similar to that of large holes in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been an experience with little technological presence: voters go to a booth and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate into an envelope.
Once officials verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter registration.
French electoral legislation codifies the procedure in a very strict way.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can check that no ballot papers are inserted at the beginning of the vote, nor are envelopes added, except those of voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each and every part of the process.

Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss national woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused respond to the names of Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki explained that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared before the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with murdering his son.
He is being held pending arraignment and trial, but any witness evidence could be altered due to the widespread publication of his image.
This is a common practice in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently and the courts considered that the publication of the photos was potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that journalists seem to be following a dangerous line when publishing photos etc. of suspects.
The Crown Office, which generally handles court proceedings, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is formalised.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over the borders, which the Palestinians demand to be based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other topics allegedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to maintain that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the complementary pest control test would be closely monitored by guards, during the supervision of the test and the evaluation of its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were hired as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting Park Conservation and Heritage director for NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation were given extensive safety guidelines and training.
Martelly invested the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine people yesterday.
It's the fifth Provisional Electoral Council in Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
Martelly responded to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October with the commission.
The sometimes violent protesters were spurred by the inability to hold elections, some of which had been pending since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod overheating failures have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it had 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling it "truly regrettable" that Apple delayed the report.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that no tsunami notification was recorded.
A former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A large number of hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released in the first instance, as were the photographers from the Philippines.
Afterwards, the photographers were exchanged for an elderly woman who needed to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a tocologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began studying preterm births in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if the hormone was administered it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators recovered the two flight recorders, the so-called "black boxes".
Fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first representative. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Something extraordinary, almost like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that "Moon was as weird as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed throughout the 2010 federal election campaign that she was of the opinion that Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme ends of the poll, 29% of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to problems with his fitness he is in the air.
He couldn't take the medication he needs to deal with the pain because it's banned in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and university professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever.
Numerous people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, a fact that was made public on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were the origin of the arrival of water on Earth along with organic matter that can create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially how Earth formed, since comets have collided with Earth for a very long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politics and lies".
Rumor has it that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save billions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than older ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being offered and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley; parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the surface.
Fears of a lack of transportation opened the possibility that the game would have to be held behind closed doors without the team's attendants.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden have pointed out that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to have lasted for much longer due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch (geospiza forte) and a Spanish cacti (geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be turned into a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided, or it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be reduced to a minimum thickness and glued to other metals. Its thickness can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance, and you can create an indicator using the juice of a red cabbage.
Cabbage changes color depending on the degree of acidity or base (alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the pH H) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
He mixes the two dry powders and then with clean, moist hands, he molds them into a ball.
The moisture from the hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had cisterns in virtually every house, connected to an advanced sanitation system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewer systems have been found.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets also existed. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, shared by men and women alike.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then bounces it back, almost immediately.
A rocket launched the satellite into space, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing it has done for us is to give us easier and faster modes of transportation.
We have the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below these, more medium-sized cats are found that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including pet cats in the wild) that eat much larger amounts of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the idea of the niche, a specialized job that each cat has been assigned and keeps them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called packs.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and pups.
Females are often related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act in a manner very similar to a wolf or dog costume, animals strikingly similar to lions (though not to other big cats) in their behavior and also highly deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can bark (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and throw with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is included in the same group ("genus panthera") as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not the same as a lion's full roar, but rather a phrase with words writhing in cries.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and find prey using their sense of smell, sniffing out where they have moved on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and also move gracefully. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or leave for a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be up to that point.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new surroundings, it also begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that we humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that we can exhale (that is, expel by inhalation).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes with plants, we make our clothes with plants, most of the food we eat is made with plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the ultimate predator of its time and was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw was adorned with over 70 sharp, knife-like teeth, plus an additional set of teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We can't be sure, but it's possible that it had a biphasic tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not be a match for it.
While most of their foods would seem familiar to us, the Romans had a handful of items for strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the nightingale.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they could recline on one side while eating.
Ancient Roman lunches could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no coconut, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of that deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples have an open courtyard and, often, an inner sanctuary that is only accessible to priests.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called "ziggurats", were sometimes erected to be integrated as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was lived outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simple open counters facing the street; stone was used to build houses.
The region of Canaan lacked important forests, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled from Iceland for committing murder and, while traveling westward, to have found a territory which he named Greenland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many distinctions between the people, kings, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The Hunt, you probably think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct, and even if there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document face down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, this document was kept in a large-sized scroll (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) that was rolled up.
So it's likely that this annotation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still invaded.
It was ruled by Vichy France, which was Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and were moving towards the Germans.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a sizeable group of people who live and work cooperatively: a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, relative to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, and also to some extent defines the size of a society.
Cities-states are the birthplaces of nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is passed down through different generations, a lasting cultural remnant and considerable dissemination.
Smaller civilizations often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations of their own.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first created a weak central government (composed solely of Congress) under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and, lacking a national executive or legislature to enforce all its laws, depended on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate.
Nor did he have the authority to override tax legislation or interstate tariffs.
The Articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national team, along with the German national team, are the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Some popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheel hockey and Formula One competition.
Winter sports enjoy more popularity in the northern regions, while Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an archipelago.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as 岛 Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan, thus initiating the transformation of the production practices of aboriginal grain and giving employment to Chinese laborers who worked on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared the country a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Winds.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they were originally like.
By 1976, 30 percent of the restoration of Machu Picchu was complete, and it continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photographic image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It still occurs today, but more importantly is the aspect ratio that the image sensor formats of digital cameras inherited.
The 35 mm format, in fact and for confusion, measures 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus, the aspect ratio of this format (the simplest integer ratio is obtained by dividing by twelve) is said to be 3:2.
Different common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The overused and often ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
It states that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came into the spotlight.
For thousands of years, Christianity united European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its dominating power in all areas affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used for the relief of suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been Rome for a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this pious principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting vital civilian and military supplies, though this blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified by many international agreements over the past two decades.
Britain seeded international waters with mines to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horror and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to live in the United States of America where he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter recommending him to Thomas Edison by Charles Batchelor (manager at his last job).
In ancient China, there was a unique method of showing the different time periods; each era of China or each family that came to power was a particular dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time, there was a bloody war between different nobles who were trying to get the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the top seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political consequences; for example, the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the occupations were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and determined to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because the ranks in the army are now based on caliber, not class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters related to the beyond of this worldly life, and he would frequently go to a cave that came to be known as "Hirana" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) to do contemplation.
That same cave, which has survived the passage of time, provides an intense picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on one of the mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find out at all if one knew it existed.
You can see nothing but the beautiful clear skies above the numerous mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures that were built in honor of the pharaoh's death.
The Giza Plateau or Necropolis of Giza in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu while a large number of other pyramids, tombs and temples of smaller size were built in honor of the wives and relatives of Khufu.
The upper arch mark resembles a V and the lower arch mark resembles a staple or square that is missing the bottom half.
Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow, while bottom means you should start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is more intense and assertive.
You can write your own notations, but don't forget that the printed marks on the bow are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of market women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), as well as the king's sister, Madame Isabelle, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a mob member scratched the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were obligated to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to pay most of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extraordinary benefits resulting from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history comprising the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000 to 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by general convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological impulse or technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that reaches beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that motor cars inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are designed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass vehicle ownership also generates a higher incidence of road accidents, which gives rise to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geographical context emerged, which, by being in harmony with the place of that society, proved better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a cradle of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, due primarily to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices that were more valued than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height in the period between the 10th or 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slowness of the communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style, and one of the great advances of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic, system that uses native stored seeds from that ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers worked in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine the differences of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of all these factors.
Members of a subculture often make their association clear by a distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, mannerism, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of boys who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults as they were growing up.
Some wild boys have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these boys is due to the parents' rejection of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that wild children experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived solitary away from civilization.
When raised by nonhuman animals, feral young show behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely identical to that of the particular animal that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, staying in the studio goes one step further.
A staycation is not a learning method but a helping hand that provides support to individuals who are undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The stays can be both virtual and real, i.e. the master or mistress is a form of stay, but so is the clip in the form of a man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual images are embedded in the software and their purpose is to question, provoke and explain procedures that could be complicated for the student to face alone.
Children come into foster care for a wide range of different reasons, which can range from neglect and abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not enriching, affectionate and educational, but it happens.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for this girl.
It's taken for granted that our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster adoption is supposed to provide all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The particular characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the focus of uses and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are proposed as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continued relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to fundamental discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements of a few milliseconds in duration.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect when a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how people who lack the ability to understand speech as a result of brain damage suffered are nevertheless able to determine sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these interpretative abilities of human behavior might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix up and down variations between both of the two reserves in each generation.
In the savannah, it's complicated for a primate with a digestive system like humans can have to meet their requirements for amino acids from existing plants.
And the consequences of not doing so are serious: increased depression, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and vegetables, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large volume of protein that integrates all essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a relatively similar way to chimpanzees on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly afterwards (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock that helps you return to consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find that you end up delaying the alarm without waking up, you can put it on the other side of the room, to force yourself to get up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing you to stand up to move.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive life force is present.
Everyone can achieve a state of enlightenment, and the only thing standing between us and this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but these have been extended by the Mahayana way of love, as well as through many techniques of Indian yoga.
To begin with, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga, through the visualization of the different deities the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are reactivated and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, clashes between systems, processes and culture led to disagreement between the countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the former allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would stretch out over the next forty years and be fought in reality, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and other different places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight, when 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Russia-Poland Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large amounts of people and cargo across the ocean.
The navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that the country maintains the ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move theirs.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain in the same way it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have been first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, in a manner similar to the more commonly known shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted merely of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and move heavier loads over the slightly more rudimentary roads of the time.
The railings were introduced very early to secure the tracks in position, however it gradually became apparent that the tracks would be much more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels replaced iron ones, and in 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Its predecessor, australopithecus, did not walk upright as is common.
Bipedal specialization is found in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join an environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it amounts to treating the symptoms, but if we don't want a purely temporary solution, we should look for the root of the problems and disable them.
It is more than evident that the world has changed considerably as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances and that problems have increased because of human overpopulation and excessive lifestyle.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a couple of blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
That same night, between 150 and 200 copies, now known as the Dunlap Flyers, were printed.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and an additional copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known Dunlap scrolls are the oldest extant copies of this document. The original manuscript document has not survived.
Different paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and they're called birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
These birds have many features that are still very similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs just like a T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so generic that it is impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household substances.
Refer to the label for the specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term beetle in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term has its origin in the classic familiarity with bed bugs, insects with a great capacity for adaptation to parasitize humans.
Both the redoubt and the bed bug are nesting animals, adapted to live in their own nest or that of their host.
Across the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to suffer from MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the child's best interests to raise a child.
These couples may choose to draw up an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to determine how the world works by scientific methods, and this method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
It's not just through experimentation, but experimentation is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations that guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view was accepted in all matters relating to science, including psychology.
As the wisdom of the Greeks declined, the West became detached from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often have a vital dependence on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
There are documented periodic rhythms, which are nothing more than responses to external periodic patterns, in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free running even in the absence of external guidelines.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was one that led to the suggestion that DNA constitutes genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have multiple different effects depending on their class, the relevance of the element of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline.
Only mutations in germline cells are susceptible to be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-focused tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural spaces to enjoy the landscape as well as the fauna and flora.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visit, photograph and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural villages to their workplace, crossing paths with others whose work destination is the same place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle service, everyone is somehow connected and supports the private vehicle-based transportation system.
Science now shows that this massive coal-dependent economy has changed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two billion years.
We all participate in society and use transportation, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear a similar level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints? Why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some other more basic problem?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and private vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they maintain with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent ranges; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be made an approximate mathematical representation.
To get a better representation of traffic flow, relationships were established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan and design traffic service operations.
Insects were the first to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the devil's horses and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others thought otherwise; the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
It makes sense, because it doesn't look like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and most flowing river on Earth, carrying eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide.
About 20 percent of the total water from the planet's rivers that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 mi).[1] It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never surpassed by those at Giza in size or technical superiority of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while in religious ceremonies Latin is often used.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humanity has known the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized on the principle that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but it was also theorized that they transform into new substances that shape what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more materials, and it's important to remember that the periodic table includes many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as coal.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many people at the time of its invention.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and uses.
Now people can type messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new replaces it.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to join a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
By splitting the nucleus again, it then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the nearest point and 100 km at the farthest.
It is thinner under the marshy areas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more marsh on the near side, because the bark is thinner, and the lava is easier to get to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized as they matured and became adults.
These theories study what makes certain people want certain things and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain actions.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In general terms, two types of behaviour can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues: at one extreme they will try to remain a "best mate".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities and demanding accountability from people.
On the other side of the coin, you become an unrecognizable individual who believes that you have to change everything the team has done and adopt it as your own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often creates divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams respond to the same levels of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams will be able to meet depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by national management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which each member is accountable. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the slow process of establishing an organization that promotes learning?
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can spill over.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that responds to customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as sharing knowledge and learning as an organization.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research, and so they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The spread of new technologies is allowing us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides a wealth of information and material that allows us to build simulation models to help us understand the process in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction overtones, it constitutes an important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence seeks to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to patient diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These kinds of things have become independent disciplines, which try to provide solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently employed in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as they have been integrated into multiple home software applications and video games.
Excursions are a very important part of any classroom, and teachers often love to take their students to places where bus travel is not feasible.
Technology offers the solution through virtual school tours, where students can see museum gadgets, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from their desks.
Sharing a virtual school trip can also be a great way to reflect on the trip and shared experiences with other classes in the future.
For example, each year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; each year the website is remodeled, but previous versions are kept online to act as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing.While students often begin their blogging experiences by showing poor command of grammar and spelling, in general, the presence of an audience makes them change.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog editor starts to make an effort to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "compulses students to learn more about the world around them".[22] The need to feed the interests of the public inspires students to show their intelligence and be interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "enables students to become more analytical and critical; by providing an active response to Internet materials, students can define their own positions in the context of what others have written, as well as their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's lovely bilingual capital, with a selection of art galleries and museums where you can contemplate the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario an example of what foreigners consider to be inherently Canadian.
Large areas to the north are barely populated and many are virtually uninhabited wilderness areas.
Here's a comparison of populations that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent of its own in terms of flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated nations of France and are famous for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region which settled deep in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that women traveling here claim to be married, regardless of their marital status.
It may also be helpful to wear a wedding ring (which does not seem too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences could lead to something they would consider harassment and it is common to chase them, grab their arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to assert your position (whether it's because of cultural differences or not, it's not acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sailors in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants, who established trading bases there, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
On the outskirts of the old medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as taxis, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of trifles, but all of this aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and most of the city's streets, particularly downtown, were buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visitor outside the city should be researched to learn about the state of the confrontation that still persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base from which to climb Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
To get around Goma, motorhomes (mototaxis) can be used. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for this short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, the term Timbuktu in English has become a metaphor for exotic and remote islands.
Today, Timbuktu is a very poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and also has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special on the Wonders of the African World.
The city offers a stark contrast to the rest of the country, with its more Arab than African air.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northwest of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which maintains different fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in other South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
It is also likely to be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which offers access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the entire territory and is the place that many tourists consider to be the most relevant.
The parade of buildings defining the skyline in Hong Kong was likened to a brilliant bar chart made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you'll have to leave the island and head to Kowloon Pier on the opposite shore.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea on the north coast.
British settlers adopted this place as their own, so if you're looking for samples of the territory's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal strip of mangroves on the planet, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest that is located in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps: they include some of the last strongholds of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which approximately one-third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 cheetahs in the area.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (crossing the river) uninterrupted throughout the day, but most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 am and 07:30 am.
As buses between districts are usually full, it is recommended to buy the ticket in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, comfortable and solid vehicles.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient method of traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is shot down. It crosses the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 metres (275 ft), the bridge is 378 metres (1,220 ft) long and has two 3.50 m (11.9 ft) wide lanes.
The tunnel under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft) long. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs checks are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now known as eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The period of colonization initiated by the Spanish lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to largely retain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
There are also tournaments and smaller matches during other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, you can consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), whose value is set in equivalence to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted throughout the islands and Stanley itself also accepts credit cards and US dollars.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and American currency will be accepted; owners should be consulted in advance to determine which payment method is most acceptable.
It is virtually impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to do so before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cool: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: rainfall remains almost unchanged throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wildlife that should not be fed or tamed.
The park management recommends keeping a minimum distance of 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, bears, and virtually any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured by not keeping a proper distance, and these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so they should be given space.
Also, it should be noted that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of the infamous naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except for a British cruiser, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle driven by the Mau movement, a peaceful demonstration in the city culminated in the assassination of the Tupua supreme chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to the fact that Auckland is situated between two harbours, it has many beaches. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All are safe sandy beaches for swimming and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Bay, in the upscale residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are usually very busy family beaches with a good variety of shops along the coast.
The most famous local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to choose from, but probably New Zealanders and Australians are the best at travelling.
The water brought in locally can be safely drunk, but bottled water is easy to find in case of doubt.
For Australians, the idea of a "coffee with milk" is foreign. A coffee is just an "espresso", the cappuccino is served with a layer of mounted cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate in the bowl meets Belgian expectations. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are organized throughout the year, and reef injuries are uncommon.
However, you should follow the advice of the authorities, follow the signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cube jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries between the months of October to April in the north of 1770.
Kenillahs do exist; however, they rarely attack humans. Most kenillahs are afraid of humans and would escape by swimming.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind in knowing that he will have a place to sleep once he has arrived at his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to or from the airport, or even combined air and hotel packages.
You can also save the reservation if you need time to evaluate the offer or look for other documents for the destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or requests should be handled in the first instance through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees choose to camp inside the festival itself and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
In order to be closer to the action, you'll need to arrive early to get a camp near the music.
It should be remembered that even if the music ends on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music until well into the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young girls.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during winter, you should check the cabin location, as the crossing through the ice generates an extremely unpleasant noise that affects some people more.
St. Petersburg cruises include a time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from having a visa (see conditions).
Usually, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They often have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and staying in the facilities.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but drunkenness clouds judgment, and all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
People who are going to drive at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, friction is low, so you can't drive the same way you would on normal asphalt.
During a snowstorm in a very short period of time enough snow can fall to get trapped.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow or hail or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries and traffic is maintained virtually without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest attraction for tourism in Africa and the most highlighted for many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to surface travel to see the impressive African wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, will run very close to cars, so a normal kit will allow for good vision.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so the best way to see them is through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "mountain walk", "hiking safari", or "footing") is a type of hiking, ranging from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, it is possible that situation will complicate.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellations will not go beyond July 2020, the scheduled date of the Olympics.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with the average price of a ticket around ¥7000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them out. Many hotels have an iron and a table available for use, even if they are not in the room itself.
If an iron is not available or you do not feel like ironing your socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Do not let the material excessively shrink (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if in doubt, you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them in their native regions.
Plagues can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases per se or dangerous animals with the ability to injure or kill people by force are generally not considered pests.
Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to purchase items free of excise duties and taxes in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries where there is high taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont features the most challenging driving conditions of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated terrain in the middle of nowhere.
If you are not used to driving on secondary roads, take it easy. Steep hills, narrow lanes, and tight curves are the most common.
The speed limits indicated are considerably lower than those of the front and rear sections (generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and their strict adherence is even more important than the reverse.
However, it is curious that mobile phone service has more coverage here than on other stretches of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and, in Bavaria, they are quite sweet and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbours: Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apples cooked in the trays throughout the year, with cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German bakery products also include almonds, bees and other types of dried fruit.
If you want to try some hard and consistent pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used to cook curry; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of dishes found throughout the country.
However, used without any other qualifier, the term usually means the typical food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now readily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a range of simple condiments dishes, with the predominant flavours favored by Javanese being peanuts, chiles, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and different aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting trapped in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged by the horse if he tries to escape. To minimize this risk, there are a number of safety precautions that can be taken.
First, most motorists wear high-heeled boots with a flat, fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall off the saddle by pulling it back in the event of the rider's fall.

Alpine snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular and involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity, with many followers, occasionally referred to as skiing 'tolls', planning entire holidays around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Skiing for hiking: This activity is also called skiing for hiking, skiing for sightseeing or skiing for hiking.
It is related to, though not usually involved with, alpine skiing or mountaineering, as the latter is done on sloped terrain and requires much harder skis and boots.
The ski trail should be thought of as similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, slightly longer distances than on foot can be covered, but only occasionally will cross-country skiing speeds be reached without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, under normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries would require applying for multiple visas and going through multiple passport controls.
However, the Schengen area in this sense functions to some extent as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas for each Schengen country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines what manufactured objects are an antique. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, in that the limit of antiquity may be lower in places like North America than it would be in Europe.
Craft products could be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar items produced on a large scale.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding its trade is important for many other professions as well.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi participated in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, caring for reindeer primarily as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions, and tourism is a major source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.

Back currents are the flow that returns from the waves after they break against the shore, usually against a reef or similar.
Due to the topology of the groundwater, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and it is possible for a fast current to form towards the deep water from that point.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from trying to swim backwards, which may prove impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
He should try again in an area where there is no possibility of being caught or, depending on his swimming ability and if he has already been spotted, wait to be rescued.
The return shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to re-adapt to their home culture.
By returning home after living abroad, one has already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of one's own.

The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the south of the peninsula bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here with the plain to then resurface and form the 360 km (220 mi) long range of the Ellsworth Mountains, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in the Antarctic, with Mount Vinson in the Vinson Range reaching 4,892 m (16,030 ft).
In remote locations with no mobile phone coverage, satellite phone is likely to be the only possible option.
Satellite phones are not generally a replacement for mobile phones, as you need to be outside with a direct line to the satellite to be able to make a call.
This service is frequently used for shipments, including leisure craft, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice.
The local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to go on a journey and learn.

Finland is a great destination for boating.The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are undoubtedly large enough for any type of yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak allow for a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is still quite exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only plan to go ashore with the excursions on board, you will not need an additional visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and city visits are not included in the cruise cost.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

However, it is not cheap - as a rule, you could end up paying four times the price of a regular business ticket and up to eleven times the price of a first-class one!
In general, it is not worthwhile to look for discounts on business or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a select group of passengers who are willing to pay exorbitant prices for the privilege of reaching their destination in a quick and comfortable way, with the corresponding fare.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
