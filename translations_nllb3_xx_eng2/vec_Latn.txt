This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils do not usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were a brownish-brown color on top with a pale carrot color at the bottom.
The discovery also provides clues to the evolution of feathers in bones.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed trunk, called a tail, but had other features of feathers such as beards and barbs, scholars have speculated that the tail was likely a later evolutionary development than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or for display.[citation needed] Scholars have suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, it simply shows adult feathers and not the fur of a polystyrene.
Scholars have suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the fur of a polystyrene.

The effect that the team was close to would have been caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most dark matter is found around galaxies like the halo, and is made up of many particle epicycles.

Voting in France was typically a low-tech experience: voters went to a polling booth, placed a hand-drawn ballot paper in an envelope, and indicated their preferred candidate.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting record.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no ballot boxes are present at the start of voting and that no ballot boxes are added other than those of regularly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to monitor every part of the process, and in the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision following specific procedures.

Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says journalists are treading "a dangerous line by publishing photos and other material of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the overall prosecution, told journalists that no further action would be taken at least until the case is brought to trial.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to settle on the basis of borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics discussed included the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees that this presence is only for five years.
Those who participated in the supplemental disinfestation trial were to be closely monitored by rangers, while the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In association with the NPWS the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooters Association's shooting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of the NPWS's Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received safety instructions and full training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that occurred in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been due to take place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheated iPod malfunctions have been reported, causing fires with four people wanting to burn their hands.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week METI said that Apple had been informed of 34 additional overheating incidents that the company termed "not serious".
The ministry responded by saying that the delay in Apple's response was "really unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there was no damage in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino politician held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several of the hostages were rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including a woman and her neighbors, were also released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an anxious woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a nurse and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if given a hormone it would stop the maturation of the mouse's lungs.
Xinhua said that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" of flight recorders.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the Queen of Extreme". To my first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. She was a unique thing just like her. Strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Moon was as dead as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and I miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who do not want Australia to be a republic have risen 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled agreed with this view and wanted Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints her health was called into question.
He was unable to take medicines to overcome his pain because they are forbidden by the Ziogi.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number on January 25.
Many people have been monitoring the survey using various tools and software since early February and it was released on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth as well as organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have been hitting the Earth for a very long time.
Cuomo, 53, was sworn in as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
In regard to the wishes he said that it is "a political gift and money".
He is said to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly on shorter routes and burn millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology different from the older ground-based radar technology that allows air traffic controllers to more accurately target aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
No overnight transport has been put into operation and surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and car park and shuttle services are not available overland.
Fears of low attendance raised the possibility that the match would be played behind closed doors without the support of the home team.
A study published in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of osseous fish on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scholars from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have said the new species only evolved over two generations, although this process is thought to have taken much longer, due to crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
They can be cut into any shape, and can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled like a simple wire that can be twisted and cracked. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and placed on other metals, and was sometimes used to decorate hand-made figures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by how many hydrogen ions (the pH Ha) are in the substance being tested.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (since the hydrogen atom is made of one proton and n electrons).
Mix the two powders together and then with wet, clean hands make a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers, which will give it a strange sensation and form a kind of cork.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a toilet in almost every house connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of sewers have been found in houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, bathrooms were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women bathed together.
When you get a call from someone so far away, you're supposed to use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and returns it almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket.Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts light and our sight.
It takes a rocket larger than 100 feet to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, the biggest thing the wheel has done for us is give us a more convenient and faster means of transportation.
He brought the train, the automobile and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized flies that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat many smaller animals such as insects, ants, lizards, and bees.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special place that each individual has and that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the animals, living in large groups called packs.
Flocks are made up of one to three unrelated adult males and up to thirty females and their offspring.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds are as numerous as wolf or dog herds, animals remarkably similar to lions (but not to any other cetaceans) in behavior, and equally deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can wrestle (though not well), swim, leap, and shoot five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four birds are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's mighty roar, but more like a brute's phrase of zigzagged words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, such as fish, fish, lizards, and bones, and almost all animals that the ocelot catches are smaller than it is.
Scientists think that the ocelot tracks and finds food animals (prey) by smell, sensing by touch where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and also move silently. Ocelots catch prey by blending in with their surroundings and sometimes leaping over them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (such as by moving across a mountain or river, or by moving to a new island so that they are no longer suitable to return to easily) it will often find itself in a different environment from where it was before.
This new environment has many resources and many competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor to its previous needs.
The original population is not changed at all, they need the same adaptations as before.
As the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they begin to resemble each other quite closely.
Eventually, after thousands and even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which basically means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they capture the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (via egg, waste).
Plants feed off the sun by photosynthesis and also produce shade.
We make our homes with plants, and our clothes with plants. Much of what we eat is plants. Without plants animals cannot live.
The mosasaur was the strongest predator of its time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
In its mouth it had over 70 sharp teeth like teeth of a cortege, and another blade was on the palate, there was no escape for those who were caught.
We are not sure, but it may have been a forked-tongued vessel, preying on turtles, fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly even cannibals.
Beware of anything that enters the water; even a small animal like a T.rex would have a bad ending.
Although many of their foods might seem normal, the Romans had a taste for strange or unusual things such as wild boar, peacocks, limes, and a type of mouse called a ghiro.
Another difference was that while the male and female monks sat on their charges, the men would feast together facing sideways while they prayed.
The food of the ancient Romans could not have been comparable to the food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, coconut, and no ancient Roman ever ate tachin.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to all their deities that was the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests ensured that the gods' needs were met with ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a raised courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which could only be entered by the priest.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was the god's sanctuary.
In the mild climate of the Middle East the house was not so important.
Much of the life of a Jewish family was spent abroad.
Women made their own food in the courtyard; shops were just benches along the street; and houses were built of stone.
There were no large clear-cut forests in Canaan, so timber was expensive.
In the Norse sagas Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for killing someone, and travelling west found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But even though he made his discovery, there were already some Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is a footprint written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, and appear on the reverse at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows who wrote it, it is known that at first this large document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that this note was added as an netiqueta.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by Vichy France, which had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and paid the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what was known as Operation Drago.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were well on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single shared culture among a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, in relation to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and describing the extent of society in some sense.
City-states are ancestors of nations. A culture of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, an enduring cultural imprint, and a just diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, with Congress as the sole component, under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took over the central government with such levity that their representatives were often absent.
The Polish national football team is the second most successful football team in the world, after the Polish national football team, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey, and formula one racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, with the Taureans participating in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu) making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the island groups it contains, Japan is often called a geographically "Archipelago".
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European seafarers named the island Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the East India Company established a base in the southeastern part of Taiwan and began to change aboriginal practices of wheat production and employed Chinese labourers in rice farming and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures called Intihuatanam, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can get a better idea of what they must have been like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the default lens format in the late analogue-lens era.
It is still made today, but the main thing is that its aspect ratio was inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS format group) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The much abused and often criticized rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
She says that the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
At this time in European history the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For over a century, Christianity held the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His power gripped everyone, from kings to peasants.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that abundance should be used to alleviate tribulation and misery and that church schools are there for that purpose.
The center of control of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and all this power and authority led many to question whether its doctrine had been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, the British established a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was successful, cutting off vital civilian and military supports, although the blockade was a violation of generally accepted international law and codified by many international agreements over the previous two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to blockade the inland portions of the ocean to all ships, causing damage to neutral shipping as well.
With little to counter this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s the attitude of most citizens and countries was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid similar events in the future.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States of America to work with the Edison company in New York City.
She arrived in the United States without glasses, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (her former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking the different periods of the year: each phase of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was a period of relative calm with the provinces divided, the most famous of these being the Three Kingdoms period which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between the various nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people died fighting for the top spot in the Great Palace at Xian.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the decimal metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to any single sovereign.
Even after the Revolution, the occupation was open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious to succeed.
The same was true for the military because instead of classifying the army by class, it was based on the number of soldiers.
The French Revolution inspired many other repressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues that went beyond this worldly life, frequenting a cave that became famous as "Hira", his mountain of "Noor" (light) for the containment.
The cave itself, surviving to the time, offers a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all difficult to climb even if one knew it existed.
All that can be seen is the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the most imposing), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "top arch" sign looks like a V and the "bottom arch" sign is a graphette or a square without a bottom edge.
On means that you should reach from the tip and push the bow, and z means that you should reach from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while a lower arch usually produces a louder, more distinct sound.
Feel free to write your own markings in pencil, but remember that tired knee marks are there for a musical reason so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Sister Elisabeth, on 6 October 1789 at Versailles had been forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob that was shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the head of a royal guard beheaded at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and the interest on their bonds was exchanged in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would have constituted the fundamental achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that incentivized the creation of the order.
The period in which the events unfold are commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism has many ideas, from a technological imperative or technological drive to the narrow sense that human destiny is guided by a basic logic along with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in contrast has effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile engine led to the development of the road by force.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
Having many machines also leads to many accidents on its roads, and this leads to the invention of new medical techniques to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, as expressed by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged and these, being in harmony with society, resulted in arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known for being the fashion capital, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known to have been a center of luxury from the 400s until the 1100s.
Their estimate was increased in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with goods and spending that were valued above what the Byzantine market offered.
It was during this period that the title of Capital of Luxury was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning the clothing was strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may have remained in place for 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, one of the major developments of the period was the introduction of buttons to clothing following the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture geared towards producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often biological system that uses saved seeds originating from ecoregions combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or generated by any combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashions, mannerisms and speech.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the unfortunate few cases of children who, through neglect, shortage, or willful abuse, were not socially cared for by adults during their development.
These children are called selvareghi. Some of them were put into foster care by people (usually their parents); in some cases this abandonment of the foster care was due to the parents' rejection of a severely intellectually or physically disabled child.
Wild boars can suffer severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or killed.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the goat exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raised it, such as its fear or its indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
What is referred to as a tool is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support for people who are about to undergo a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
These scaffolding integrations can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but is also the object of the graphs in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended to discuss, suggest, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the individual student to handle.
Children are put into foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from abandonment, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not corroborating, caring and educational, but it does happen.
We believe that the trustee system is a safe place for these boards.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care must provide all the necessities that are missing in the home from which the puppies were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions of uses and approaches to gratification.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous reporting" were identified as motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant advances in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell whether a person is telling lies by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately gauge someone's sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two basins of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and the trait is removed from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools at each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its requirement for amino acids by sourcing them from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in their leaves and legumes but for primates like us they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ant, termite, egg) are not only easily digestible but provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during the normal sleep time interval and shortly thereafter falling asleep (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively meaningful wake to bring you back to a conscious state without waking you up completely.
If you try to reset the shutter while you sleep, it may be positioned on the other side of the room, thus forcing you to get out of bed to shut it.
Other options based on biorhythm alone involve consuming a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that characterizes a person is correlated to the amount of tension present in the body and spirit.
The lower the blood pressure, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find fulfillment and satisfaction.
The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been extended through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques typical of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through the yoga poses themselves, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the Divine Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are created, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment takes shape.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to the collaboration of the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures caused the decline of the nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were enemies, and the Cold War ended.
It would go on for the next 40 years and be fought for real by proxy armies and their battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had been broken and the only hope left was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans were soon overshadowed by the events of the following day when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The purpose of navies has traditionally been to ensure that a nation maintains the ability to move its own people and goods while simultaneously interfering with an enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time the Royal Navy, which mainly used U-boats, was very keen to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
The goat appears to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes relied heavily on wool, meat, and fur.
Domestic goats were typically kept in flocks that grazed around their own hills or other grazing areas, often controlled by goats that were often deaf and dumb, similar to the better known sheep herders.
Wagons had already been built in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagons were usually wooden towers placed one above the other, they allowed the horses pulling them to move faster and pull heavier loads over the temple's paved roads.
The tracks were laid almost immediately to hold the rails in place, but a child at the time realized that the rails would be better with an iron rail above.
This became common practice, but the iron and wooden wheels of the carriages were destroyed.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron railway was built.
The first means of transportation was the feet, humans began to walk on them over two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning "standing man") first appeared.
Those that preceded it, the Australopithecus, did not typically walk on foot.
The bipedal feature was found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can learn to live better with the environment, we can join environmental movements and we can even become more active in trying to alleviate some future suffering.
In many cases this is how to treat the symptoms, however, if we only want a temporary solution, we now need to find the cause of the problems and fix them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have become even bigger because of mankind's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as the "Dunlap Flyers".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on the steps of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who delivered it to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets known to still exist are the oldest known copies of this document, the original handwritten copy of which has not survived.
Many paleontologists still believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
Many people do not think of dinosaurs as having wings and being able to fly.
But there are many things about the bones that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scales and spines, they lay their eggs and walk on their backs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are denoted by binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal bleeding may not be immediately visible, and symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to warrant immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of a green medicine bottle or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to that particular vein.
The word zimeso is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
It derives from the ancient familiarity with the lemur lizards which are insects adapted to infest humans.
Bedbugs and bedbugs are nest-like creatures, adapted to live in the inn or guest house.
In the United States of America alone there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) which is the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that females are twice as likely to get MS as males.
A couple may decide that having a child is not in their interest, or in the interest of the marriage.
These couples may decide to try to adopt a child.
In adoption, the rights of the natural parents end so that another couple can act as the adoptive parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand the world through the scientific method, which has guided almost all scientific discoveries.
It is not all about experimentation, however, and an experiment is just a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, while asking questions and making observations guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, his Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
Once in decline in knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are crucially dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological means.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological controls are self-sustaining oscillators that will send a period of free cycling on even without external input.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was made of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by tagging the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the amount of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations from elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is attractive to people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including its fauna and flora.
Examples of activities to be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people drive from the countryside to work and are passed by others who go to work where they are then driven away.
In this transportation system everyone is connected in some way and supports a transportation system based on their private cars.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems make so many people feel uncomfortable, why do they have problems every day? Do transportation engineers not understand anything? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to construct a reasonably consistent boundary within themselves; thus, traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings from the back onto the body.
This gives them the possibility to hide from predators in many dangerous places.
Also, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are butterflies and aphids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some thought it was, while others thought it was, that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and some other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't make sense that the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth, and the largest, with more than 8 times the volume of water in the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river, at some points being up to a mile wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water in the world's oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, draining into the Amazon from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction was abandoned until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or the technical excellence of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language commonly spoken by most of the working people in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as these have been found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we now see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals, not forgetting that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and naturally, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
Alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon may also be present.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a billion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
However, with the advent of newer writing systems, the pencil fell into disuse and decline.
People now swipe messages on computer screens, they don't need a template.
One may wonder what will become of the keyboard once it is tapped again.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A feat like pushing a heavy object up a hill, the fission of the nucleus is a small part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to split with little or no push.
The surface of the Moon is made of dust and debris, the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may have been seas on the left side because the crust was softer, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centred on the search for what makes people tick or what makes them tick.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues; one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the cool guys" (or cool).
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that you have to change everything the team has done and make it your own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to friction between the bosses and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than members of a normal team because their teams may meet in different time zones that may not be understood by the local administration.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? Innovation is about putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be seen.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a hurdle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) states that the Continuum approach is a method that is used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical strategy to investigate its knowledge, thereby narrowing the area of inquiry and making it much more precise.
The correlation between cervical pathology and behavior supports scientists in this research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and investigate previously unseen server structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and material to make simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has its roots in fantasy, it is a very important part of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The study of AI is concerned with the realization of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Exceptions include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and even handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These became separate disciplines, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are also often used in business, medicine, engineering, and military fields, as they have been incorporated into many home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are very important for every class, and often the teacher would like to take his students to places where it is not possible to go by bus.
Technology provides a solution through virtual tours, where students can visit a museum, visit an aquarium, or view art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is updated annually, but older versions are kept online as a photo album.
Blogs can also help students write better. While students often begin their blogging experience with grammar errors and poorly written words, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, bloggers strive to write better and avoid criticism.
In addition to blogging, it also encourages students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them. The need to increase public interest inspires students to be more engaging and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the normal school day.
A brief use of blogs can encourage students to become more analytical and critical; with active responses to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of what others write as well as describe their personal perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful and bilingual capital and is home to many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and further north are the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more make Ontario look like Canada's quintessential outsider.
Many areas even further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost entirely uninhabited natural areas.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and wildlife-wise is a continent in its own right.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to their lands, which was especially successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism ended in the 15th century, with Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama finding the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: I think that all women who travel claim to be married, regardless of whether this is true or not.
It is also advisable to bring a ring (as long as it is not a toy).
Women need to understand that cultural differences may be what they perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, touched, held, etc.
You have to be firm in saying no to men, and not afraid to make your reasons count (cultural differences or not, it's not fair!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port, called Anfa, by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids.
The Portuguese demolished and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who made it a trading base.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
Around the old Medina, you can find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as crowns, ceramics, stoneware, nargile and a whole range of trinkets, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano, which burned most of the city's streets, especially downtown.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any further travel outside Goma must be prepared in order to understand the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest Gorilla watching expeditions in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (mototaxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) fare is around 500 Congolese Francs for a small round.
As well as being relatively difficult to reach, Timbuktu has become a river  a metaphor for exotic and distant places.
Timbuktu is also a poor city, although its fame makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main tapes of the PBS special Henry Louis Gates' African Wonders of the World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arab than African charm.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-east of South Africa along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 (19,500 sq mi) and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each one supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most popular attractions and is considered the symbol of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily park admission and conservation fees.
It may be a good idea to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the most visited place by tourists.
The series of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a glowing bar chart, recognisable by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, go to the island and go to Kowloon on the waterfront on the other side.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is heavily built on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is where the British colonists were first taken for their land and so if you want to see traces of the territory's colonial past this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of mangrove in the world, extending 80 kilometres (50 mi) into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and the Indian part of the forest is designated as the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps, however - they are also remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km2 (1,200 sq mi), of which about one-third is water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and one estimate is that there are 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 domesticated deer currently living in the area.
Buses leave from the Interdistrict Bus Station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although the majority of departures, particularly those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, are between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is best to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by small, comfortable and durable Japanese Coaster Buses.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of transportation to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 271 feet (83 m), are 1,208 feet (378 m) long, and have two 12-foot (3.50 m) wide arches.
The air span under the bridge is 50 feet (15 m). Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge has been operational since September 2017, with the Brazilian customs checkpoints being completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant ethnic group inhabiting Eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called "the great province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the halfway stages at Las Cañitas
Tournaments are held there and at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy half-match gear, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound Sterling (FKP), whose value is fixed as equivalent to that of the British Pound Sterling (GBP).
The designs can be exchanged on the only bank of the islands, which is in Stanley in front of the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted at Stanley.
In the Outer Islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the interested party in advance to see what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to change the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures over 30 degrees are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold; temperatures rarely go below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make it appear colder than the thermometer says.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's mammals are familiar to humans, wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife!
No matter how docile they appear, the bison, deer, and kidney, bears, and any other large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors become ill because they have not kept a proper distance.These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous and therefore they seal their space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep the base camp clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of only 40,000.
Apia was founded in about 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval disaster in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to enter the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British ocean liner, and only 200 American and German ships were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of the great Tupua chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches in Auckland, as Auckland is situated between two harbours, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Shore (North Harbour district) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost entirely sword-shaped, with a thick layer of shadow on the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive shops are on the Waitemata Harbourfront, in the Mission Bay and St Heliers shopping districts of central Auckland.
There are places for families, sometimes with too many people, with many shops.
The main local beer is the Number One, which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines to try, but those from New Zealand and Australia might be better.
Tap water is safe to drink but bottled water is easy to get if you are not sure.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is a fortress; a short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled to a creamy (not foamy) consistency, and the tea is served without a latte.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard, while the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many tours of the coral reef are made throughout the year, and accidents from these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the instructions of the authorities, obey the signs, and be alert for safety signs.
The cucumber seals are near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist but rarely attack humans, and most sharks are fearful of humans and the new way.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active ocean dwellers, their main habitat being river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the security and peace of mind that there will be a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you can book other accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agency.
Travel agents often offer packages that include connections, airport transfer options or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also put your reservation on hold if you need time to think it over or to get the necessary documents for your arrival (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests would however have to go through the agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp at the site, and most consider this to be a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action you have to get in early to get a camping spot near the music.
Note that although the music on the main stage has ended, there are parts of the festival where it plays late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is, as going through the ice causes horrible noise for everyone involved.
Cruise ships to Saint Petersburg include some time in the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see regulations).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize time and money spent by patrons, windows and doors are often absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They typically have special offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers in good spirits and keep them spending money.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks, but drunkenness hinders judgment, and good poker players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who wants to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or below-ground temperatures.
On icy, uneven roads, grip is low and you cannot drive as if you were rolling on the asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to block a road in a short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling snow or condensation or by glare on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted all year round.
Safari is perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to the overland journey to see the incredible African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to get close to machines and standard equipment allows for good eyesight.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A bush walk safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari or footing safari) is a short hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Certain events will be held at other sites across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you book your 2020 flight and accommodation before the postponement announcement, you may be in for a rough ride.
Rules on cancellations vary, but as of March cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket selling for 7,000 yen.
Ironing clothes can help them dry out. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for loan, although one is missing from the room.
If a cast iron is not available, or you do not want to wear stretch socks, you can use a suction cup if available.
This is to prevent the tissue from becoming too hot (which can cause it to become hotter or, in extreme cases, burn out).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain types of threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you should have a problem you may want to consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter parasites that are not familiar to them in their place of origin.
Harmful animals can cause food spoilage, irritation, or in the worst cases cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that make people sick or kill them by force do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping represents the opportunity to buy goods duty free and can be found in certain specific locations.
Travelers from countries with other taxes can sometimes find themselves facing a fair amount of taxation especially for products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The Point Marion-Fairmont section presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be wary of them: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are fairly basic compared to previous and subsequent sessions - commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and adherence to these limits is even more important than in other circumstances.
Interestingly, however, the telephone ringing is much louder here than at other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good and in Bavaria is very rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with coconut trees present in the pastry all year round, and cherries and apples sprouting outside of the city.
Many German baked dishes contain almonds, walnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often accompany a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a rich but chewy pastry, try the one called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the place.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of India and Pakistan yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands from which to choose, Indonesian cuisine is an all-encompassing term that includes a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without other adjectives, the term tends to mean the food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Available only widely across the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a spectrum of simple flavoured dishes, with the main flavours that Javanese people love being bajiji, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavoured spices.
The staffs are supported by the rider's feet hanging low from either side of the saddle.
They provide stability to the rider but can pose safety problems due to the potential for a rider to get bogged down.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be pulled away if the horse starts to run. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions must be taken.
As a first step, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, particularly the English saddle, have safety bars that prevent staff from falling off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - the first Chilean destination for climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a wide variety of granite walls and cliffs.
Climbs include views mocked by peaks. Climbers from all parts of the world continually establish new routes through its infinite wall potential.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that include jumping off snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards tucked under one's feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many avid travelers, sometimes called "ski fanatics", who plan entire vacations to ski on a specific location.
The concept of skiing is very old - the grottoes representing skiers date back to 5,000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski mountaineering or ski touring.
It is related to but usually does not include ski mountaineering or alpinism, as the latter two activities take place on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as similar to a similar hiking route.
With good condition you can get farther than walking - but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on the beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would involve multiple visa applications and passport controls in many circumstances.
The Schengen Area, however, acts as a single country in this respect.
While in this area you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa to visit each Schengen member separately, thus saving time, school and paperwork.
There is no universal definition on what constitutes an antique handmade goods; some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variation, with the age limit being lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products may be termed antique even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
