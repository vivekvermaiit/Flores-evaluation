Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely held, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional appearance.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were bony-brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed handle, called the main shaft, but have other features of feathers - soft hairs and soft hair - the researchers concluded that the main shaft likely represented a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but for thermoregulation or for flapping. The researchers pointed out that although this is a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not those of a chicken.
The researchers pointed out that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not those of a chicken.
A car bomb detonated at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, early yesterday, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They determined that the Sun functions based on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system is determined to be driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing more.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star, which is related to the flow of the plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of the inversion of the magnetic poles.

The work accomplished is mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team expects should be caused by the tidal forces and the shear between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon affects the Earth, causing tides and currents, so the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is found in a sort of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused came to court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services could remove the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Each has since appeared in the Edinburgh Circuit Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from eyewitnesses could be called into question as her picture is posted everywhere.
This is commonplace throughout the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system is different and the courts consider the publication of images to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it really seems that journalists are following a thin line if they publish photos etc. of suspects".
The state prosecutor's office, which has full jurisdiction over the prosecution, indicated to reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment.
According to the source, the document refers to the border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to return to the pre-1967 Middle East war period.
Other topics reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is a holy place for both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan River Valley.
Israel seeks a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of 10 years after the agreement is signed while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave the presence for a period of five years only.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be under strict surveillance by the rangers, as the test was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Under the Sporting Hunters Association's hunting program, in collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Hunters Association of Australia (SHA), qualified volunteers were recruited.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEC).
This is the fifth Martelli Interim Election Commission in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed that SER resign earlier as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Martelli Commission was actually a response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the non-holding of elections, and some date as far back as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving appliances.
Last week, METI announced that it had received notification from Apple of 34 more cases of overheating, which the company considers "not serious".
In its response, the Ministry called the delay in Apple's report a "regrettable fact".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am (09:19 pm GMT Friday) and was followed by a second earthquake at the same time.
Officials from the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Service said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers replaced the scene with an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began to research premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that introducing the hormone would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs of the baby.
Xinhua announced that government investigators found two "black boxes" for recording flights on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by her fellow fighters.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died in the night with two moons. Quite uniquely just like her. A strong woman. "
Dustin Goldstein Runnels commented that "Luna was as aloof as I am... maybe more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose 8 percent from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this opinion, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the extremes noted in the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have raised doubts about his fitness.
He was unable to take the medication he needed to overcome the pain, as it was forbidden by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water transport to Earth, along with organic matter that could create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, specifically how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed the bill allowing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older technology based on ground-based radar, to help air traffic controllers more accurately identify the aircraft and give pilots accurate information.
No additional transport is organised, and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley and parking spaces and public transport overpasses are not available at the stadium.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the possibility of the match being held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer, due to cross-breeding between the endemic Galapagos stingray, Geospiza fortis, and the large cactus stingray, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape, it can be twisted into small shapes.
It can be dragged in a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided, beaten with a hammer or dragged in layers.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-made pictures in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH value, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean, moist hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel unusual and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with running water in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewerage systems in houses have been found in Minoan-era cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where both men and women went together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back at almost the same time.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket, over 100 feet high, to take a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and the best thing it has done for us is it has made transportation easier and faster.
He has provided us with the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the domain, a special thing that every cat has that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called herds.
The herd is made up of one to three blood-related males, along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion herd acts similarly to a wolf or dog herd, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, as well as very deadly to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of the strongest man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's full-speed roar but more like a phrase of words that resemble a roar and a loud cry.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds - almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are considerably smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find prey by smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
They see beautifully in the dark with night vision and move stealthily, too.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it is often in a different environment from the one in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment and begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (breathe out).
Plants produce their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
Our habitats are made from plants, our clothes are made from plants, plants make up the majority of the food we eat, and animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with another row at the top of its mouth, indicating that it had no recourse to anything that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a chattering tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it's possible it was even cannibalistic.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex was not able to outrun it.
Although most of the food is familiar to us, the Romans also had their own strange or unusual feasts, such as wild boar, peacocks, slugs, and a type of rodent called a polv.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their meals sitting on benches, rich people wanted to have communal feasts, where they could rest while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly did not contain products that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a chicken.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each god, which was considered the home of that god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to serve the needs of the gods through rites and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes separate pyramid-shaped elevations, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the mound was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the ancient Jewish family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open-air stalls facing the street.
The land of Canaan was not densely forested, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Old Norse lore, it is said that Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Despite each country being "Scandinavian", there were a multitude of differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might believe that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a hidden treasure map.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is inverted and stands at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was originally rolled up for safekeeping.
So it's possible that the note was written simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichyevite" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies entered Southern France, and the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated the south of France and marched on Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture formed by a significant large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", meaning "civil", related to the Latin words "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", and it somehow defines the size of a society.
Civilized culture presages the transmission of knowledge across generations, a long-lasting cultural imprint and a fairly large spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - where the only constituent body was the Congress - under the Treaty of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judicial body, it relied on state agencies, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor did he have the authority to override laws on taxes and duties between states.
Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, it is often referred to geographically as an archipelago
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors spelled the island's name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in local grain-processing habits and employing Chinese artisans to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took over the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a taste of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, a restoration of thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been completed and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the film size that prevailed at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its ratio is inherited from the sensor image formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually quite confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (which is divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS group of formats) are identical or significantly close to coefficient.
The most abused and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamics while maintaining order in the image.
It states that it is most effective to place the main subject at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Roman Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subject to criticism.
Despite differences in language and customs, the Christian religion united European nations for over a thousand years.
Its all-pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are intended for that purpose only.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money has caused many to question whether the principles have been met.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off much-needed supplies to the military and civilians, though its blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
With few options to respond to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, pacifist and isolationist attitudes prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to begin work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a collection of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these phases was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Ming dynasties.
During this period, there were bitter struggles between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died in the struggle to sit on the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the earth belongs to all people rather than just one ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were opened up to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the military because, instead of rank in the military being based on class, it was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this earthly life. He often went to a cave that became known as Hira on the mountain Nur (light) to meditate.
He shut himself in a cave, which has survived through time, giving a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find even if someone knew they were fasting.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the multitude of surrounding mountains.
Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza remains today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of a number of large pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of Death, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign upper arch resembles the letter V, and the sign lower arch a joint or square lacking its lower side.
Up means you should start at the top and push the shovel, and down means you should start at the frog's foot (where your palm holds the shovel) and pull the shovel.
The upward movement of the whistle produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a louder and more aggressive sound.
Feel free to write your own characters, but remember, the printed notes are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris, from Versailles, on 6 October 1789 by a group of market women.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles before the frightened queen.
The military costs of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were borne by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to defray most of the costs, and the interest on the bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos were a major asset of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time when the events occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological impetus or technological imperative to a strong sense that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology, in and of itself, follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence and that technology, on the other hand, has "influences" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a state-level road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new methods of production are being worked on to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increased frequency of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the rehabilitation of injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, taken up by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography created individuals, and over time customs and culture associated with geography emerged, so in harmony with the place of society, they were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until about 1100 CE.
Its status deteriorated during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this period the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style culminated between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western fashion was able to lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments at the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Existential agriculture is agriculture that is undertaken to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Existential agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seed originating from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
In the past, most farmers farmed for their own needs, as is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ as a result of age, ethnic group, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style that encompasses fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look back at the few unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, misery or deliberate abuse by adults, remained unsocialized while growing up.
Some feral children were confined by humans (most often by their parents); in some cases this abandonment of the child was the result of the parents' rejection of the child's serious mental or physical disability.
Rude children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have grown from animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully grown from animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (in physical limits) almost the same as the animal that cared for it, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, a technique called "building a ladder" goes a step further.
The technique called "building a ladder" is not a learning method but is an aid that provides support for individuals going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold, but so is the clutch man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual ladders are built into the software and are intended to interrogate, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to master on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages or foster care for reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but still grows up.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our welfare system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, a stable education and a secure health system.
The care should provide for all the needs they lacked in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet contains elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to pleasures.
For example, learning and socialization have been proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Both Amy and McCord (1998) identify "personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" as new motivational aspects, exploring audience reactions to web pages.
The use of video has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it could be possible to detect whether someone is lying by accurately interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book The President's Speech, noted how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain injury are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection allows for the removal of expressed variations from the group.
Segregation and recombination shift variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources.
Further, failure to do so would have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all the circumstances, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you accidentally turn off the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which requires a person to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less pressure, the more positive life force is present.
The only thing that's holding us back is the pressure and negativity from ourselves.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, which were expanded with the Mahayana path of love and a host of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the 'divine yoga'. Through visualization of several deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war ended, differences in systems, processes, and culture led to disagreements between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and to be fought in real combat, with proxy armies, on war fronts from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and a host of other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defensive force had already been defeated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgefront.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of eastern parts of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The transport of goods by ship is definitely the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The Navy's job, by tradition, is to ensure your country maintains the ability to transport your people and goods, and at the same time, to impede the enemy's ability to transport his people and goods.
One of the most important examples of this recently was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop such traffic.
If the Allies had suffered defeat, Germany could probably have conquered Britain just as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or pastures, tended by goats that were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar shepherds.
Horse-drawn trams were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were mainly built of parallel wooden planks, they could be pulled by horses for greater speed and to pull a greater load than that carried on the bad roads of the time.
Rail sills were used early on to hold rails in place, but it was gradually found that rails would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels than the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the first train with all-iron wheels was launched.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not so accustomed to walking upright.
Two-legged adaptations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and maybe even become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
In many cases this is the same as symptomatic treatment, but if it is not a temporary solution, then the root of the problem should be found and thus eradicated.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a great deal because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been made worse by overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the manuscript draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomas, was sent a few blocks down to John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, today known as the "Dunlap Pages".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Building on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap documents that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today: they are called birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have shelled feet and claws, lay eggs and move on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the management of information encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or if computer jargon is used, they are called bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible, and symptoms such as vomiting are fairly common, so a diagnosis may not be immediately possible.
The best indicator of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open can of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense.
The term derives from the ancient similarity to the cockroach, which are insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the larvae and the parasites are nidicolous, adapted to living in a nest or to inhabit their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can have parental rights over the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, and in fact, it is the method that drives most of the scientific research.
But, still, it's not just that, but experimentation, and an experiment is a sample that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, as well as observation, also drive scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, with special emphasis on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West remained cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
A multitude of observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often consciously highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their creation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, which includes bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of free cyclic movement even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are sex cells.
Only mutated genetic cells can be passed on to children, while mutated cells anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the plant and animal world.
Examples of activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to work and mingle with others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shared transportation, everyone is somehow connected and supports the transportation system based on private cars.
Science now points out that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed lands, such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they disappoint on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers know to stick to a reasonably constant framework; thus, traffic flows know to have a certain reasonable constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward alongside their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the fairy horses and the unicorns.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, stretching six miles [6.4 km] in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers around the world into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main course is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and water is collected from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which by then were already more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous country.
Legislation and official communication of the Vatican are in Italian.
Italian is also used in everyday speech by the people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle considered everything to be composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
It is something like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also thought that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloy is actually a mixture of two or more metals.
Metals include elements such as calcium and potassium, as well as metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can be put together in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good companion for many when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil's status and use declined.
People now type messages on computers and never have to go near a blade again.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The physical bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to create a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then, by splitting the nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they have a tendency to decay with or without a small boost.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the "crust".
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thin under the seas, thicker under the plateaus.
The lower side may have more basaltic plain because the bark is thinner, making it easier for the lion to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what excites people or what they like.
According to these theories, humans have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as they mature from children to adults.
These theories consider what makes some people like the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors may arise when managers begin to deal with their former colleagues: on the one hand, the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable for their actions.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has been doing and make it his or her own.
However, the leader has ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often results in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams operate to the same standards of excellence as standard teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of the conventional team because their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an outstanding component of a virtual team.
The management team is the "invisible team" to which each member corresponds. It is the visible team that sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of creating a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity are sparked.
As a result, the organization's collaborative process of overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process of serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, and so it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the foundation of scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This provides a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and user questions, and handwriting, voice and character recognition.
Such things became separate disciplines, which focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
After being incorporated into several software applications for home computers and video games, the AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a big part of every school, and very often, the teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
And virtual sharing excursions are a good way to remember the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital, every year the website is reconstructed, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start the blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, audience attendance mainly changes this.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become aware of the world around them".[32] The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can encourage students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' written texts, and also highlight their own views on specific issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, characterized by a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario uniquely Canadian, as foreigners consider it.
The vast areas to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is arguably the largest and most isolated continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands and it quickly spread to the Comoros and the Maya.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west, by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female passengers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (not just a ring that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stick to your own position (with or without cultural differences, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Darou I-Badia, but by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases here it was given the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajin vessels, pottery, leather goods, nargile and a whole range of cheap ornaments, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far eastern parts near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that congested most of the city streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, any visit outside Goma should be checked to find out the state of unrest that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla hunts in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although the city is a tourist attraction and has an airport, today Timbuktu is an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites, due to the threat of desert sand dunes.
He was one of the main subjects during the PBS special, "The Wonder of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is the exact opposite of the rest of the country, because it has more Arab charm than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park stretches over an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with a different wildlife.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the forerunner of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance fees and park admission fees.
It may also be useful to purchase a 'Wild Card' which can be used to enter any park in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong comes from the island of Hong Kong and it is the place that is the main focus of many tourists.
The arrangement of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is contrasted with a glittering graph highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head opposite the coast of Kowloon.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the arid land along the northern coast.
It's where the British colonists took possession, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the longest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast, into the Bangladeshi and Indian interior.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just swamps with their rising waterfalls - they include some of the last remaining strongholds of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer herds now live in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those travelling east and Jakarta/Bumnang depart between 06:30 and 07:30 hours.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most areas, small Japanese minibuses are used, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and efficient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 kms) and Punakha (200 kms).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oiapoque River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint Georges de L'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 272 feet (83 m), are 1,291 feet (378 m) long, and have two 12-foot (3.5 m) wide walkways.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The plan is for the bridge to be fully functional in September 2017, when Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "Great Province of Southeast Asia", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted more than three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches, check out Asociacion Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to that of one British Pound (GBP).
Money is exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley, just across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and alongside Stanley credit cards, US dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although British and American currency may be available; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable to you.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; in the summer months temperatures above +30 degrees Celsius are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and moisture together make it colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "wet" or "dry" periods: the amount of rainfall remains relatively the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, they are still wild animals, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park service guidelines, keep at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they may appear, buffalo, moose, bears, and almost any large animal could attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and since 1959 it has been officially the capital of Samoa.
In 1889, the port was the site of the infamous naval blockade when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British warship sank, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
In the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city ended with the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamase Lyalophy III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland encompasses two harbours.
The beaches on the north shore (in North Harbor County) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches safe for swimming, and most have shade from the trees on the shore.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Messina Bay and St Helier in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a good selection of shops along the shore.
The most famous local beer is called Nambr wan, which is not a heavy but a pleasant and refreshing beer.
There are many French wines that can be taken, but wines from New Zealand and Australia can travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water can be easily found if you are fearful.
The idea of "ordinary white" coffee is not unique to the inhabitants of Australia. The short black coffee is "espresso", the cappuccino is with a lot of slug (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made to Belgian standards, and while expensive, the fruit juices are excellent.
Trips to the reef are common throughout the year and it is rare for reef injuries to occur from these causes.
However, take the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The cube jellyfish occurs along beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans anyway. Most sharks are afraid of humans and just swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the ocean constantly, their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking ahead of time, a traveler can rest assured that he will have a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with certain hotels, although you can book accommodation elsewhere, such as camping, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies commonly offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also save your reservation if you need some time to think about the offer or to provide other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
All changes and additions or requests should be checked first with the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp at the venue, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the center of the action as possible, you'll have to get in early and get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages has ended, there are parts of the festival where it is played late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location because crossing through the ice creates a terrible sound for the most endangered.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include a city pass. Cruise passengers are exempt from applying for a visa (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers for food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in the mood and stay here.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who drives at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low and cannot be driven as on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or snowfall or by condensation or freezing of the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic runs almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most outstanding for many visitors.
The popular sense of the term safari refers to a land journey to observe the wonderful African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to vehicles, so even standard equipment provides good vision.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they are best seen with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a ""wildlife walk"", ""mountain safari"" or ""walking"" walk) consists of walking, either for a few hours or a few days".
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
There are differences in cancellation policies but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-induced cancellation policies do not continue until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have an ashtray and a sanding board available for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a pebble, or if you don't want to wear pebble socks, then you can try a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful that the material does not become too hot (which can also cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, combustion).
Although there are various ways of purifying water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it takes just one minute for the water to boil, while in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, which is something to be concerned about, and you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are not present in the regions from which they come.
Parasites can spoil food, cause inflammation or, in more serious cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force, are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods exempt from paying taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The Point Marion to Fairmont trail has the most exciting driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, passing through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: high slopes, narrow roads, and sharp curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), so strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Yet, miraculously, the cell signal is much stronger here than in other areas, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pies are commonly made with apples in the dough throughout the year, and in the summer they can be found with cherries and plums.
Many German pastries contain almonds, nuts, and other nuts.
If you want small but rich sweets, try these, called berliner, fancuchen, or krapfchen, depending on the region.
Karite is a herb- and spice-based dish that contains meat or vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "light", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the continental parts of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used to prepare curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
The word Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the nation of 17,000 islands.
But when used without additional attributes, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a selection of simply seasoned dishes, the most dominant flavors of Javanese cuisine are peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The legs are the supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but there may also be safety considerations due to the likelihood of his feet getting stuck in them.
If a horse throws the rider, but his foot gets caught in the bridle, if the horse escapes, it is possible to pull the rider.
First, most riders wear high-heeled boots and a slim, very tight, skirt.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety handles that allow the harness belt to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it in a fall.
Cochami Valley - The main mountaineering destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite slopes and fissures.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes through the endless potential of the mountain's sides.
Winter alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you glide across snowy terrain with skis or snowboards on your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, often known as ski vagabonds, whose entire vacation revolves around skiing at a particular location.
The art of skiing is very old - there are cave paintings of skiers as far back as 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, with the first recreational skiing club opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to, but does not always include, alpine skiing or hiking, which are performed on steep terrain and require much redder skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you could cover greater distances than by walking - but you would rarely reach the speed of a cross-country skier without a heavy backpack and on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, acts somewhat like a state in this respect.
As long as you are in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to pass through passport controls.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money and documentation.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, but some tax agencies define antiques as items that are over 100 years old.

Artifacts can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
The cultivation of irvasis is the most important means of existence for the Lapons, and the culture associated with trade is also important for many other professions.

Rapid is the backflow of waves that break on the beach, usually from a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is collected in the deeper parts, and here a fast deep water current can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head for a place where you will not be stuck again, or, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted, you may want to wait for a rescue.
The return shock occurs earlier than culture shock (there is a shorter bliss period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have readily adjusted to a new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time adjusting back to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you adapt to a new culture and forget some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first go abroad, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
Many people would not assume that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.

Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in both the lakes and the coastal archipelagos.

If you go to the coast by excursion boats you will not need a special visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises in the brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see in the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.

Courier services are well paid for fast delivery of shipments. Time is often very important for business documents, merchandise or spare parts for emergency repairs.
For some lines, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem for other lines and smaller firms.
If they send shipments by air, some routes take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get them through faster was to send them as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger.
The obvious way to travel first or business class is to pay a hefty sum of money for that privilege (or better yet, let your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: however much it is considered a rule of thumb, expect to pay four times as much as economy class for the price of business class, and eleven times as much for first class!
In general, there is no point in asking for a discount on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a large sum of dollars for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
