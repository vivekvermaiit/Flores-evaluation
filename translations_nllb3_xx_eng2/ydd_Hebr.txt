While one experimental drug appears to reduce Ebola deaths, to date no drug has clearly proven effective in treating existing conditions.
One antibody mixture, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies showed it had less benefit than sought in preventing death.

USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and takes note of the strong need of the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by continuing to engage in meaningful change within the organization, rather than as discertifying.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could potentially shed light on how abuse of such a form as that heroically performed by the survivors of Larry Nassar could go on unnoticed for so long and take on any useful and lasting change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC both share the same goal of making the sport of gymnastics, and others, the safest possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and supportive environment.

This not only confirms that Hach's dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils cannot normally provide, such as color and three-dimensional appearance.
Scientists say the creature's fur was chest-brown from above with a bright orange-colored underside.
The find also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Although the dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but did have other structures of feathers - barbs and barbels - researchers have determined that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than the other structures.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used for flight but for regulating warmth or beauty. The researchers suggest that, although this is the weakness of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult and not of a bird.
The researchers suggested that, even though this is the female of a young dinosaur, the example shows adult feathers and not a chick's feathers.
A car bomb detonated at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey early yesterday killed two police officers and injured more than a dozen others.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to mimic observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The result the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon has gravitational force, which causes great waves, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Ninth Astrological Sign (Sagittarius) galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that the dark meter affects other dark meters in the same way that regular meters do.
The theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around a galaxy in a sort of fine, in is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech process: voters isolate themselves in a booth, lay a pre-printed piece of paper and mark the candidate they want in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and writes under the ballot list.
French electoral law strictly regulates the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can guarantee that no converts are used at the beginning of voting and that no converts are added except those of the properly identified and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend any part of the process. At times, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampra Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Salanki said the accused appeared in court wearing covered panties.
At least three people were in the house when the car crashed, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while rescue agencies freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Edinburgh Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeboye has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting trial, but any initial evidence is likely to be suppressed because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have viewed the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish images of, for example, disguises.
The Crown Office, which is primarily concerned with prosecutions, has advised journalists that no further comment should be made until indictment.
The document, loosely edited, will discuss the border war that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered were reported to include the future city of Jerusalem which is sacred to both peoples and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands an immediate military truce in the valley for ten years from the date of the agreement, while the PA only agrees to allow such a truce for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary fixed-cathedral test would have been closely monitored by rangers, as the test was followed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of park conservation and heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received full safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
It's Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early withdrawal of CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-racism protests that began in October.
The official-led protests were driven by a failure to hold elections, some already scheduled for 2011.
About 60 cases of non-working iPods surviving have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with mild burns.
Japan's Ministry of Finance, Trade and Industry (METI) said there were 27 accidents related to the planes this week.
Last week, METI said that Apple had informed them of 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company called "unfortunate".
The ministry responded by calling the report's rejection by the EFL "regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Chief Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no injuries reported to the public.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has stopped Hong Kong tourists from boarding their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendaza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
6 households, including children and relatives, were evicted early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she had to use the toilet. Mendaza was later shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in the medical field.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm labor in his spare time.
His research work suggests that if a hormone were administered it would slow down the baby's fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators seized two "black box" recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tammy Dreamer said "Lana was the first head of EXTEM. My first supervisor. Lana died on the night of two daughters. Quite unique just like you. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as mad as we are...maybe even more so...love her and I will remember...perhaps she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled for the 2010 general election, those who support Australia becoming a republic have declined by 8 percent since 2008.
Supervising Prime Minister Julia Gillard maintained throughout the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the members in the poll are unanimous, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his back injuries his health condition became a concern.
He was unable to take the necessary drugs to overcome his scars as they were caused by the gems.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, invented the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of sending water to the Earth along with organic meters that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth sphere formed, because comets have been entering the Earth sphere for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political flouting and naivety".
He is considered to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of dollars in fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to precisely detect plugs with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is added and international trains do not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
Concerns about transportation shortages raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without any team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species of creature formed in just two generations, although it is assumed that the process took much longer, due to overlap between an endemic Darwin's finch, Dysphysa fortress, and the immigrant cactus finch, Dysphysa conistrus.
Gold can be worked in all kinds of crafts, it can be mined in tiny crafts.
It can be embedded into these threads, which can be constructed and patched. It can be hammered and wrapped into sheets.
It can be made very thin and embedded in other metal. It can be made so thin that it was once used to cover the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make a mark using red bean juice.
The juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH mass is indicated by the number of hydrogen (the H in the pH ions in the tested chemical).
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dried herbs together and then, with clean hands, boil it together in a ball.
The tissue on your hand will react with the outer layers, which will feel differently and form a different shape.
The cities of Harafa and Mahéjji-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every dwelling, in addition to a decrepit sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Centarini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilizations, toilets were often part of an open bathroom where men and women shared in a mixed society.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in the sky receives the call and then reflects it back up, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into the sphere by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in the sphere because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our reading and viewing ability.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other modes of transportation.
Below them are more medieval cats eating medieval peas ranging from hazelnut to walnut and rhubarb.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat the much more uncommon small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the idea of the niche, a special job that each cat has that keeps it from sleeping with others.
The lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called frogs.
Frogs are made up of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and single offspring.
The women are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pride behaves in a manner very similar to groups of wolves or dogs, animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not other giant cats) in their behavior, and are also very lethal to their victims.
A good athlete on all sides, the tiger can crawl (though not well), swim, jump over great distances and sleep with five times the power of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. The four cats are the only ones that can roam.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a set of strange, shouted words.
Aselots love to eat small animals. They will catch algae, snails, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals of Aselot are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that Oslatts tracked down and found animals to eat (sniff) by smelling where they were on the ground.
They can see very well at night with night vision, and also move very carefully. Escelates catch their prey by looking like they are surrounded and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (such as if it moves over mountains or water, or if it moves to a new island and cannot retreat easily) it will often find itself in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different resources and different choices to be a stronger competitor than they were before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adjust to their new identity, they begin to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot call themselves the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is just the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also create shade.
We make our houses of wax and make clothes of wax. Most of the spices we eat are made of wax. Without wax, animals could not exist.
The Moosaurus was the climax predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Moosaurus.
Its long mouth was lined with more than 70 knife-edged teeth, along with an ivory set on top of the mouth, meaning it was not possible for Sai to have simply overstretched its way to escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a tongue attached. Its diet included chechapoha, large fish, other carnivores, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex is no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did have some lesser-known or unknown foods, including wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of creature called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals while sitting in benches, the rich men liked to have benches next to each other where they could lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ur-Ancient civilizations could not include nomads who came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever forbade a turkey.
The Bablim built a main temple for each of their ancestors, which was considered the abode of the god.
People made sacrifices to pagan gods and the believers tried to serve the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and then an inner space where only the deities can enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called cigars, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special place for the god.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent under the open sky.
Women cooked in the courtyard; businesses set up tables facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no great empires in the land of Canaan, so the value of the harvest was very high.
Greenland was settled by nomads. In Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he went further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But apart from its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although almost every country was 'Scandinavian', there was much difference between the people, kings, rulers and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever looked at the Maui National Treasure, you might think that under the Declaration of Independence, a treasure map was written.
However, nothing is true. Even if there is something written on the bottom of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the second side of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The words appear below the document, transliterated.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that initially the large fragment document (it measures 3⁄429 inches by 1⁄224 inches) was temporarily turned over to Storch.
If so, it is likely that the note was added simply as a label.
The D-Day invasion and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Wichy" French, who were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
Around 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the attack was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and then turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture characterized by a significantly large group of people living and working together as a co-operative society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning human, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also denotes the greatness of the community.
City-states are the substitutes of peoples. A civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge through successive generations, cultural feasts that are maintained, and equal dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
Throughout the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Cities formerly formed a weak central government - with Congress being the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
It also did not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended and the states so simplified the central government that their contributions were often dismissed.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA WORLD CUP champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are mostly popular in the northern region, with Italians competing in international games in Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in the geographical sense.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European explorers recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices, and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of Taiwan's western and North Sea coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimansaki, renouncing its rule over Taiwan and Japan, which had ruled the island until 1945.
Makhu Pikhua consists of three main buildings, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Graces.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been converted and the conversion continues to this day.
For example, the most widely known still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film mass during the analog film era.
It is still broadcast today, but much more importantly the pages have been censored by the digital camera image censorship authorities.
The 35mm layout is gradual, slightly sloping, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of the display (counting on twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) was therefore said to be 3:2.
Many well-known formats (APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very closely approximated by this aspect ratio.
The widely used and often forgotten definition of third is a simple definition that makes alive the moment it holds a moment of order in an image.
It says that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersections of lines that divide the image in detail and the length and width (see example).
Throughout the epochs of European history, the Catholic Church, which grew rich and powerful, came under critical scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has kept European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His pervasive power affected everyone from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are there specifically for this.
The centralization of church authority in Rome over a thousand years ago and its concentration of power over money has led to many questions about whether this belief has been upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain made a naval offer to Germany.
The strategy proved effective, eliminating vital military and civilian facilities, although the blockade was against accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
England had mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the sea, forcing passage even to neutral ships.
Because of limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine warfare.
The prevailing sentiment of most citizens and peoples throughout the 1920s was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, people wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a songbook, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bechtler (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China has a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each family in power was a unique dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most notable of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Throughout the ages, fierce wars were fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods of ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people returning to sleeping in the highest seat in the wealthy Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political implications of the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to humanity and not to just one leader.
Even after the revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military because instead of army ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also influenced many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in matters within his ordinary life. He often went to a cave known as the "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (lightness) to meditate.
His own writings, which have survived the test of time, give a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
Located high in one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not usually easy to find even though someone knows it exists. Once it's in the lake, it's a total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of the world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that is still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was made in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up stick" sign looks like a V and the "up stick" sign like a staple or like a box that folds its underside.
Up means you could start at the end and push the sticks, and up means you could start at the end (this is where your hand touches the sticks) and pull the sticks.
An up-bending usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bending is stronger and more fixed.
Feel free to include your own signs, but remember that printed beauty marks are there for a musical reason, so they can be generally respected.
The deposed King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, on the 6th of October, 1789 were forced to go back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of wealthy women.
Within a week they were back in Paris surrounded by hooligans who shouted and threw stones at the king and queen.
The crowds forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
Somewhere a member of the mob has beheaded a royal guard murdered at Versailles in front of the detained monarchs.
The war costs of US imperialism in the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people alone.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds made in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino population would be mainly due to U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the development of the Order.
The period during which these spends occurred is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages follow the Early Middle Ages and precede the Late Middle Ages, which generally ends around 1500.
Technological intelligence is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological stupidity or technological demand to a strong sense that human happiness is driven by an intrinsic logic connected to scientific laws and their development in technology.
Most translations of technological terms share the same two general ideas: that evolution itself follows a course of primarily cultural or political impact, and that technology in turn "affects" societies inherently, rather than under social conditions.
For example, one could say that the motor car automatically leads to the development of chassis.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A high number of car owners also leads to a higher occurrence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the creation of new techniques in the medical field for the selection of injured bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determination, brought out by writers such as Goethe, Pictet, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography brought individuals together, and over time customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and the latter, being at peace with the place of society, were preferable to uneducated fixed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Paris has consistently been known as the fashion capital of ancient Europe.
It is known for being an epicenter for luxury beginning from about 400 A.D. and continuing until about 1100 A.D.
Its status was diminished throughout the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that pilgrims returned with gifts of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market had offered.
It was the time when the transfer of the title of Fez capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style was at its height in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the extensive communication channels, the average life expectancy in the West can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the period as a result of the craft of the cross-hatch was that people began to use buttons to shape clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture directed towards the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using closed crops native to the eco-region along with planting rotation or other fairly simple methods to obtain maximum plant yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of their own identity.
Subcultures can be defined differently by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The qualities that make a subculture unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, regional, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership by a typical and emblematic use of fashion, which includes fashions, etiquette, and slang.
One of the most famous methods used to depict the importance of society is to create from the few unfortunate pairs of children who, due to poverty, misfortune, or wilful fate, have no society with which to grow up.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild". Certain feral children have been adopted by humans (often their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment has been due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitation.
Many children may have survived severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are thought to have been raised from animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child will almost always display behaviors (with physical limitations) similar to those of the animal, such as fear of or similarity to humans.
If project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, then scaffolding goes a step too far.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of a scaffold, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and are designed to ask, assist with, and explain procedures that might be too difficult for the student to complete on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons including abuse, neglect, and even kidnapping.
No child should have to grow up in a society that doesn't honor, doesn't show compassion, and doesn't care about education, but they do.
We see foster care as a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and quality health care.
Pastoral care is intended to meet all the needs of those who have fallen into the home from which they were removed.
The Internet brings together parts of both masses in interpersonal communication.
The obvious character of the Internet leads to other aspects of the use and satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal mixing" and "increased connection" were also identified as new motifs by Eimey and McCord (1998), when they measured viewer reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the study of microexpressions, facial movements that last for several seconds.
In particular, it has been reported that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly evaluating micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper on the President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury can still perceive truthfulness correctly.
He even suggested that such abilities in comparative human behavior could be demonstrated by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two ways of genetic modification: maintained and released.
Mutation adds new genetic differences, and selection takes it out of the stack of already-existing differences.
Segregation and recombination change back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the abundant resources available there.
Again, failure to do so has serious consequences: growing depression, malnutrition, and premature death.
The most abundant growth resource would be the protein found in leaves and legumes, but these are harder for primates like us to digest, even if they're cooked.
In contrast, edible seafood (mussels, termites, peas) are not only easy to digest, but also high in protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors faced their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep overload is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be made easier by using a quieter alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up all the time.
If you happen to set the clock in your bedroom, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to check it.
Other biorhythm-based effects include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, which forces one to get up to go to bed.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is proportional to the inverse of the amount of attraction that is in one's body and mind.
The lower the attraction, the more positive life force is available. Every person has the possibility to find peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own attraction and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended by the Mahayana way of love and by many methods of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite unique. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of only-love
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and paintings.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Diety Veda. Through the practice of certain diets, the energy is unified, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness is enhanced.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. By the end of the war, the contrasts of system, processes and culture led to the countries' falling out.
With two years of the war's end, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought for generations, by representative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive was in tatters, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize around the Roman brigade.
However, these plans were reversed overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the northern regions of Poland, thereby continuing the Great Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the fastest way to move large numbers of people and goods across water.
The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to carry your people and things, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to carry their people and things.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans attempted to help transport men and materiel across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly US ships, tried to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have overpowered England as it had overpowered the rest of Europe.
Chigs were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to consider them easy access to milk, linen, meat, and skin.
Domestic hunting was usually conducted in herd groups that roamed over mountains and other areas, sometimes accompanied by herd dogs. The herd dogs were usually children or young males, very similar to the more widely known pack dogs. These methods of herding are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon roads only contained parallel bridges, they allowed horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and carry greater loads than on the somewhat heavier roads.
Crustaceans were known to hold the shins in place quite early. In general, however, it was realized that it would be more effective if you had a stick of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron outdated the carriage-mounted hollering.
In time, iron spoke was replaced by the steel spoke. In 1767, the first all-iron sheets were produced.
The earliest known transportation was walking, and humans began walking directly two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus.
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not generally decline.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 Ma, although ceylonthrops may have walked on two feet as far back as seven Ma.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future pollution to a certain extent.
This is just like symptomatic behavior in many cases. However, if we want something that's not just a temporary fix, then we can find the internal problems, and we can deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological efforts, and problems have become bigger because of population and man's luxurious lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congress President John Hincock and Secretary Charles Thomsen and then sent across the street to John Dunlap's printing house.
Over the course of the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, known today as "Dunlop Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the gardens of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which led to it being loaned to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Breitweights still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original written copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with plush feathers and nails, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two lower legs like a T-shirt.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits  or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal damage may not always be apparent immediately. Symptoms such as fractures are very general and a thorough diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal contamination may be the presence of an open layer of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Consider the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific drug.
The title insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The word comes from native familiarity with bed-bugs, which are insects readily adapted to infest humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are niccaluses, having become accustomed to living in the nest or habitat of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that females are twice as likely to have MS as males.
A parent may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to conceive a baby.
The population can choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents end their parental rights so that the other couple can be parents to the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. The method actually conducts most scientific research.
But it's not enough to just experiment, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible behaviors, ask questions, and make observations. It also accompanies scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers looked to classical texts and, specifically, to the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As science became distant from the Greek language, the Western world became increasingly alienated from its Greek philosophies and scientific origins.
Many accepted rhythms in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on whether there are endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Temporal rhythms, which are not simple responses to external temporal signals, have been documented for most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-regulating oscillators that will continue to go on some uncertainly-shaped cycle even in the face of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main arguments that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made two attempts by marking either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Changes can also have several other effects on the type of change, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only changes in germline cells can be passed on to children, while changes elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism caters to people who are interested in visiting natural places for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including plants and animals.
Patterns of on-site activity include hunting, fish-hunting, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Barnia.
Every now and then, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplace and join others whose workplace is where they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on fruit cars.
Science now indicates that the massive carbon economy has eroded the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
And in developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems have such a backlog, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just plain stupid? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and the relationships they have between each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic law is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a logically consistent range; thus, traffic streams tend to have some logical consistency and can be more or less determined mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, associations have been made between the three main character strings: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help with the planning, layout, and operation of the railway facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily invade enemies and find food and travel more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back to the length of their bodies.
This gives them a wider choice of small spots to avoid traffic jams.
Today, the only warbirds that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other planets).
That seems understandable, because the world doesn't feel like it looks, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that leaks out of the planet's lakes into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although building pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their grandeur and the technical excellence of their construction.
New kingdoms of ancient Egypt were built on their earlier monuments, which were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the world's smallest sovereign state and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian and its law and official communication.
Italian is also the common language used by those working in the State while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about primarily chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can be detected in nature in their native form and are quite easy to unearth with unique tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a combination of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of things (in the same order): solid, rarefied, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the world is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so wonderfully small that trillions of them could fit in the period between the end of matter.
So, the Bligh became a good friend to a lot of people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing emerged, the blade was reduced in status and use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, having never been near a blade sharper.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy truck over a mountain, the nucleus releases some of the energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to break apart with little or no chance.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer part of the moon is called the crust.
The layer is about 70 km thick on the inner side and 100 km thick on the outer side.
There is a diner under the sea and a diner on the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thicker. It was easier for lava to escape to the surface.
Content theories are centered around findings that make people wonder and what they like.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been inherited as they progressed to adulthood.
These theories look at what is certain about certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can be distinguished when managers begin to manage their former firms. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the company" (or "brothers").
This type of supervisor has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making decisions, assessing responsibility, and keeping people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything that the group has already done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in friction between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are held to the same standards as conventional groups, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often function as the point of contact for their actual physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional group members as their group may meet at different time zones which may not be understandable by their local governance.
The existence of a true "virtual team" (Larcin and LeFesta, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "consideration team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The consideration team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the active divisions of an organization, wisdom can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a disruption can lead to a new and improved process to serve the needs of the buyer.
Before an organization can be transformed, leadership must foster a culture of transformation as well as share science and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of achievement.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to detection. Therefore, it narrows the research to make it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for some time that various types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and bring about changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our brains.
Although AI has a strong association with science fiction, AI forms a very important sub-field of computer science, dealing with the creation, learning, and intelligent integration of a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent work.
Patterns include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwritten acknowledgments, notes and memos.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the world of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into several home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Quite often a teacher will love to take her students to places where you can't go by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual exploration. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip is actually also a great way to look back on an expedition and share the experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from Bennett School in North Carolina paint a website about their trip to the state capitol, each year the website is modeled after FundsNey, but older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blog posts with a mix of grammar and writing, the audience's attention usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to cater to the interest of the audience tries to make students smart and interesting/interested (Tauto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to take their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Active use of blogs "may enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can make clear their position in relation to others' descriptions as well as publish their own views on certain issues" (Orwak, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful bilingual capital and has a wealth of art galleries and museums that depict Canada's past and present.
Deeper to the south are the Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unparalleled natural beauty of the Muscat and its interior.
All of these things and more have led to Ontario ever being considered truly Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas higher in the north are entirely inhabited and some are almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and is a world class destination for wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury sea-coast Afro-Earth.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, and it was very much accepted in Qamaris and Mayat.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorers Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women should be prepared to say they are pregnant, regardless of their pregnancy status.
It is helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women may notice that cultural differences can result in what they would perceive as cheating and it is not uncommon to be followed, caught in the arm, etc.
Be firmly masculine, and don't be afraid to stand strong (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but it was later abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Darou L-Badia and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who set up trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to visit in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tadjis, clay-painted articles, leather goods, hakas, and a large selection of gigabos, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Gamme was devastated by lava from the Nyireganga volcano that covered most of the streets in the city, mostly in the city center.
Although Gamma is completely secure, every visit inside Gamma should be tracked to understand the level of conflict that is occurring in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for exploring the Nyiragongo volcano, with one of the most expensive mountain guerrilla trekking in Africa.
You can use Bada Bada (motorcycle taxi) to get back to Gamma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Along with its relative distance, "Timbuktu" is often used as a metaphor for beautiful, wide countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a famous city, although its good reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airfield.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert decay.
It was one of the huge celebrations throughout Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, having a stronger Arab look than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Krakadhil River.
The park occupies 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 other ecoregions, each one supporting other wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa, and is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANparks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily conservation and entry fee for the park.
It is also possible to come for an emission to buy a wild card, which provides access to any selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider to be their main focus.
The layout of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a beautiful bar chart that becomes more prominent with the view of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head out to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Emberstons of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily pressed on reclaimed land close to the north coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The sandbars are the largest literal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sandbars have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian country is called the Sandbars National Park.
These worlds are not just mangrove swamps, however, they include some of the last remaining parts of the mighty jungles that once covered the vast plain.
The Sunderbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 foundlings in the area.
Buses depart from the sub-district bus station (near the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar Bumtang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the inter-district buses are usually full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaches, which are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Faro (No 150) and Funca (No 200).
The Oepac River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oepac River connecting the cities of Oepac in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oepac in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres (272 ft), it is 378 metres (1,210 ft) long and has two lines of 3.50 metres (11.8 ft) width.
The maximum height under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction work was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest western group of indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also subsisted on agriculture.
The Chaca Empire was inhabited by other groups of primitive tribes such as the Guayesuru and Paijua, who subsisted by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "the giant province of the Indians", was born as a result of a clash between Spanish forces and the local native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonization era that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of the Ascension in 1537, Paraguay has tried to retain much of its ancient character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the Pala Fields in Las Canitas.
Small competitions and fights can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, look for Associated Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value is estimated to be the same as one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley O'Keefe, across from the FIC West supermarket.
British pounds are commonly accepted throughout the islands and in Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
In the outer islands, credit cards will generally not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; consult with the owner in advance to determine an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange people's currency outside the islands, so exchange for cash before leaving the islands.
Because Antigua is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30o Celsius are normal.
The winter can be exceptionally cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the master says.
There are no separate "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the number of rains remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are expected to see humans, animals are still wild and should not be tortured or killed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they look, bison, elk, moose, bear, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are harmed because they do not keep a safe distance. The animals are large, wild, and can be feared, being overlooked, giving them their space.
In addition, they fear that smells attract bears and other wildlife so immediately put out the carrying or cooking of smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on an island of Oahu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port is the site of the infamous naval battle of Troyer in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were recovered, except one British cruiser, with almost 200 American and German lives lost.
Throughout the war of independence organized by the Maoi movement, a peaceful assembly in the city ended with the assassination of the chieftain Tafae Thomas Lilufi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's straddling of two ports. The most popular are in these three areas.
North Shores (in North Harbor Region) are on the Pacific Ocean and range from Long Bay in the north to Devenport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and mostly consist of shade provided by pahutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located above Waitemata Harbour, in the upper reaches of Michen Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Often they are crowded family beaches with a good range of businesses that line the beach. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is not a complicated beer, but a tasty and refreshing one. The other local beer is called "Mante".
There are many French wines to be had, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better.
The local tap water is generally safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're afraid.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso", cappuccino comes all the way to the top with cream (on the bottom), and tea is topped with milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standards. Fruit soups are more expensive but very good.
Many races to the summit are made year-round, and injuries due to any of these factors are rare.
You can still take instructions from authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near shore and near river water-ways from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found out of season.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and prefer to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the river floodplains north of Rockhampton.
Planning ahead gives the travelers the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you may be able to arrange other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually put in containers containing Friday, transportation arrangements to and from the airport and numbered airline and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the project or to produce other documents for your purpose (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should go through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For certain festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to sleep on the spot, and most attendees consider it an important part of survival.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early enough to book a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if music on the main stages has ended, there may be parts of the performance that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with disabled children.
If you're skiing across the Norden Baltic in winter, check the cabin's location, as the Edurne glacier creates a dangerous hazard for those most affected by it.
Saint Petersburg cruises take time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to get the most out of the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually removed, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood, and they keep the place.
Some people gamble for drinks at their own expense. But their gambling is harmful to their health, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
One who will travel at high latitudes or over mountains may take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On dirt and snow roads, the roads are weak and you can't drive as you would on bare dirt.
Across the snow-covered valleys, enough snow to make you stick can fall in a very short time.
Sight-sight can also be limited by falling or snowing snow or by rain or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly unabated for an entire year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many travelers.
The title safari in popular usage refers to overland journeys to view the magnificent African wildlife, mainly on savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars and standard equipment will allow good exploration.
The lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush safari", "spacing safari", or walking "putting") involves walking, either for several hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the suspension was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, mostly coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not been extended to July, 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It is estimated that most evening tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Beagle-friendly clothing helps to prevent it. Many hotels have a beagle lounge and a beagle board ready for use on the mountain, even if no one is used in the room.
If you can't afford a bagel iron, or you don't mind carrying a variety of bags, you can try using a hand dryer if you can afford one.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to become too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are other ways of purifying water, some more effective against certain pressures.
In some places boiling water is enough for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have a concern, you may want to consider buying your water in a pre-treated bottle from a bottling company.
Rodents can interact with animals that are unfamiliar to them from their native regions.
Fists can contaminate food, cause inflammation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Insect-eating animals themselves, or dangerous 'wild animals' that can harm or kill humans by force, do not qualify as pets.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from tax at specific locations.
Travelers who travel to countries with high taxes can save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated underworld terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your head above the water: smooth gradients, narrow lines, sharp turns of wind dominate there.
Poised maximum speeds are considerably lower than in the previous and following sections  average 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than not.
Interestingly, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in any other area, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German cuisine is quite good, and in Bavaria, it's quite rich and varied, similar to that of its neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit trees are abundant, with boiled apples in bloom year-round, and cherries and flowers appearing throughout the summer.
Many German beverages also contain mandrake, hazen-nips, and other nips from Boomer. Famous beverages often go very well with a glass of strong coffee.
If you want to explore small but rich gardens, try what are called wands according to the local Berliner, Funkiechen, Krapf.
A curry is a dish based on potatoes and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either a trick or a nose applied to the number of fluids.
Inland regions of northern India and Pakistan often use yogurt in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent often use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, indigenous food is a catch-all term covering a huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, if further qualifiers are used, the title usually means the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese food has a variety of unique flavored dishes, the strongest flavor being peanuts, chilis, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic condiments.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can have safety issues due to the possibility of a rider's foot sticking into them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but is caught with one foot in the stirrup, he may be beaten if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most passengers wear travel boots with a heel and a smooth, slim sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety roots that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if it is being rear-ended by a falling rider.
Cuitzama Valley is Chile's premier crag destination, known as the yazmity of South America, with a selection of granite large walls and crags.
Shale formations include steam-scattering outcrops of shale mountains. Shale formations from all parts of the world continue to break new ground amidst the endless possibilities of waves.
Up-mountain snow sports, which include ice skating and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard held at your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ski bum, planning entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
Skye is very old. Cave paintings show skye as far back as 5000 BC!
Up-the-mountain ice skating is a sport that dates back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not include elfin-style ski tours or mountain climbs, the latter conducted in extreme territories and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Think of a skiing road as a similar walking road.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat larger and farther distances than walking shoes  but only in rare cases will you achieve the speed ratio of cross-country skiing on heavy backpacks on padded tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent states. Passing through many countries under normal circumstances would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen Zone, however, works as one country in this regard.
As long as you stay in the zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas to each of the Schengen member states separately, thus saving time, money and manual labor.
There is no accepted view of what manufactured items are antique. Some tax agencies call goods older than a hundred years old antique.
The view has geographical variations, where the age limits can be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar machine-made goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income for the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade is also influenced by many other factors.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were mixed into the large reindeer herd, but lived from hunting fish, ducks, and geckos, having reindeer mercenaries as draft animals.
Today, Sami citizens are working in modern jobs. Tourism is an important industry in Sami, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gypsy" is often considered derogatory due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate portrayals of Romani people.
If the country you want to visit is the subject of a travel advisory, your health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to ask about the policies of governments other than your own, but their policies are designed for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may have to cope with different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are simply a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The leaks presented are often brief, superficial and simple compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any violent weather event with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can vary depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive snow, and wildfires are both forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water spikes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all the risks of severe weather that will affect their area as well as the potential impact on travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for 'environmental courses' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical application.
A course will normally be 2-5 days and will include royle-fly, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife are well known, but publications dealing with war scenes are rare.
Residents planning sex reassignment surgery must ensure they are carrying valid documents for the return trip.
The ability of governments to issue passports without writing the gender (X) or documents altered to fit a desired name and gender preferences.
Foreign governments' ability to recognize these documents is just as far-fetched.
Memories at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people may not be able to look out of the window to approach the scanners with their fertility and dignity intact.
Reef currents are the returned plumes of waves that hang in shore, often near beaches or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in much deeper parts, and a rapid wave to deep water may occur there.
Most deaths occur as a result of drowning while trying to swim back upstream, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the water, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get caught again either, depending on your motivation and if you've been spotted, you might want to wait for a rescue.
Re-adjustment shock occurs more quickly than culture shock (it is less of a honeymoon phase), it lasts longer, and it can be more serious.
No matter how hard they try to adapt to a new culture, it is sometimes hard for them to adapt back to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you're accustomed to the new culture and you've lost some of the familiarity of your home culture.
When you first arrived in a foreign country, people were usually patient and understanding, realizing that settling in a new country requires adjusting.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for refugees returning home.
The pyramid cries and lecture performance is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see it in silence before the performance begins.
You usually hear the rumors of tourists and vendors. The story of rumors and rumors is just like in a history book.
The Sphinx has always been the underground and the custodian of a long story.
The scenes are set on the pyramids and the other pyramids are painted.
South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several peoples and have the most buses, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km (75 mi) north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Islands with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the collapsed caldera of an extinct volcano forms a wonderful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Country is the area south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Water.
The mountains of the peninsula here converge on the plateau, then emerge again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Plateau, crossed by the Minnesota Glaciers.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vincent Maffitt, which reaches 4,892 m (16,029 ft) with Mount Vincent.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone is your only option.
A satellite phone does not usually take the place of a mobile phone, as you need to be inside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is very often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have large data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about signing up for the service.
A very popular option for those planning a vacation is to wander around and learn.
This is especially common with school dropouts, allowing them to take a year off before university without taking away their education.
In many cases, this can be learned in a mid-year course abroad to improve the chances of getting into higher education back in your home country.
It will usually be a small fee to enroll in the study programs.
Finland is a strong shipping destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands as well, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and islands, you don't even have to have a yacht.
However, the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, small vessels or even a kayak to sail.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but outside of this quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most of the notable Baltic shipyards are set for an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several busy days and then return and sleep on a boat at night.
If you go to the mainland only by boat, you do not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Several cruises set for Berlin, Germany in the spring. As you can see from the map above Berlin is not near the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled before or have had any other trauma.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's nothing more than the personal fears and dislikes of other things that a lot of people have.
In part, this may explain how aircraft work and what happens throughout a flight to help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or being out of control.
Companies that specialize in shipping containers are well compensated for shipping things quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an important transaction.
On some of the routes, the larger companies had their own airplanes, but for other routes and smaller companies it was a problem.
If they were shipping goods by air freight, certain routes would take days to unload and customs.
The only way it can get through faster is to send it in as checked baggage. Airport regulations won't allow them to ever send in any baggage without a passenger, and here's how you get in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a small amount of money for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap; as the rule states, you can expect to pay more than four times the normal economy rate for business and eleven times for first class.
Generally speaking, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain elite group of travelers who are willing to pay the highest price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they calculate accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.

Economic relations have rebounded between the two parts of Maldives despite its failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Maldives is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once the elite city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, built around a vast lake and surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are intermingled with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Halldarsvik overlooks the neighbouring island of Østerøy and has an interesting octagonal church.
In the churchyard there are interesting marble sculptures of doves across various borders.
It's worth spending half an hour walking around the hospital.
To the north side in easy reach is the romantic and interesting town of Sintra which became known to foreigners after a glossy account of its beauty recorded by Lord Byron.
Scout bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Caba de Raca.
Also to the north is the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site that has almost unchanging significance to a tiny fraction of the world's population.
There are many men and women who are still alive and have spent their time here, and many others who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with the utmost dignity, seriousness, and respect that it deserves. Don't make any jokes about the Shoah or Nazism.
Don't defile the space by painting or scratching graffiti into the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it is established by law to be the first and official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are reported only in Catalan, but unplanned stops are reported by an automated system in many languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be egotistical, ungrateful, and self-important.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to return to Paris is to be on top of the performance, performing as one who is "bien élève". It will greatly complicate the journey.
Paris's sharp doors will close quickly if you show some finesse.
The Plitvice National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beaches, spruce, and pine trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean plantations.
It has a particularly wide range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different types of soils and many different degrees of altitude.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, saw, lynx, wildcat, and cafferkeellie can be found there, along with many more well-known species.
While visiting the mansions, women are required to wear veils that cover the knees and also cover the shoulders.
Most of the cloisters are set up for women who come in at an early age, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, you will get a smile from the man or woman entering.
In contrast, men are required to wear skirts that cover the knees.
This can also be borne out by the many items that come in, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing the shoes. One size fits all for the men!
Majorcan cuisine (this mayork cuisine), like similar regions in the Mediterranean Sea, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil on occasion.
A simple popular evening meal, especially in the summer, is the Pa Amb Ali: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any edible ingredients such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All verbs, including the word "c" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between different verbs and objects.
It also ostensibly makes reading easier, whereas writing is somewhat more complicated by having to figure out when and whether a verb or adjective is used in a limited sense.
Hebrew is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main notes to look for are C and G, because their sound is related to the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce R and RR differently: car means dear, while car means car.
Persian has a messier simplicity and in Emmerson's smooth grammar.
Therefore, learning this grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand questions better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Raman language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish often come to the conclusion too quickly that the language is close enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Early modern observatories are usually not contemporary, and remain museums, or places of education.
Vibrant lighting in their day was not as problematic as it is today, and were usually found in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are giant dwellings in remote areas with diffuse atmospheric conditions.
Considering where cars go, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where flowers were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the royal court.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, so defy the temptation to remove even a single specimen.
If you visit a previously landscaped garden, then this "specimen" will also expose you to being thrown out, an argument.
Singapore is generally a highly secure place to be and easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But being located in the "high tropics" just several degrees north of the equator you will have to contend with extreme heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also several buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are thinking of taking goes into Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Christian Four.
Inland waterways can be a good area around which to nest a halide.
For example, visit the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or sail along the Erie Canal.
They also mark routes for well-known spots and baking routes.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus Christ.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at one point to watch the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may very well be an early Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday morning throughout the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking into the celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived in the islands arrived by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the continent's long stretch, mammals cannot make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals have been replaced by invasive reptiles, horses, rats, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will have the phenomenon of the fall night, which means that the sun will not shine over the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more frequently around the clock.
As these areas have a small population, and lighting is therefore not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and different from what people from the West can be used to.
Coats are common business attire, and co-workers call each other by family names or by job titles.
Workplace collaboration is critical, putting a dent in group work as it allows for individualized explorations.
Employees often must obtain their supervisor's consent for every decision they make, and are encouraged to question their supervisor's suggestions.
