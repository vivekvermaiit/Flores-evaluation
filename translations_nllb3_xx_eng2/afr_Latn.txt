Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers are chestnut brown on top with a pale or caretoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, also called the rhachis, but have other features of feathers - shaft feathers and bearded side branches - the researchers deduced that the rhachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or rejection. The researchers suggest that, even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not chickens.
The researchers suggested that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not chicks.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by gravitational forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, causing the tides, so the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a type of radiation, and is made up of very small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new cultivar "was very disturbing and disturbing because of the very high death rate".
Some patients may have picked up the germ in the hospital, thinks Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital health workers.
In one year's time, one infected person will infect 10 to 15 close acquaintances.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with TB still appears to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Their thermal behavior is not as temperate as large caves on Earth that both maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with these deep holes in the ground, says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astro-geology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was a traditionally low-tech experience: voters isolated themselves in a booth, and then put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law codified these procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were present at the start of the election and that no envelopes were added except those counted and those by registered voters.
Candidates may send representatives to follow each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, according to specific procedures.

The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car struck it, none of them were injured.
As a result, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be affected because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish legal systems work differently and courts have seen publication of the photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists cross a dangerous line when they publish photos and other material of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall control of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until indictment.
The document, according to the informant, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a sustained military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
Field guards closely monitored shooters in the supplemental pest control trial, as the trial was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four selected shooters for the initial shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provincial Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some already due since 2011.
Around 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
METI announced last week that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The minister's office responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "truly a pity".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 a.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office stated that no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been reported dead so far.
Six hostages, including kidners and elderly persons, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to use the bathroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While employed at the hospital, Liggins began to do research on preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that administering hormones would accelerate the fetal lung development of the baby.
Xinhua reports that the state's investigation team recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
People wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that Luna was just as strange as I was... maybe even more...loving her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 previous voters in the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those in the poll share this view, their wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist, had been due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware or software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water supply to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth was formed, since comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as political chatter and folly.
People are speculating that he will try to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FLA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controller to pin down the aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is available, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and stop-and-go facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a loss of transportation increased the possibility that the game would be played behind closed doors and without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the appearance of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the species adapted in only two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes, and it can be rolled into small molds.
It can be pulled out into a thin thread, which can be twisted or braided. It can be beaten out or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical agent. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in the pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Twist the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, it will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, and they were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back, almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing it has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
This brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits and goats.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free- roaming pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat has a special job that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups known as packs.
Lion troops consist of one to three related males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly close to lions (but not to other big cats) in action, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full - voiced roar of a lion but more like a sentence of squealing words.
Small wildcats like to eat small animals, and will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost any animal smaller than themselves that the wildcat hunts.
Scientists think that oselotes track and locate animals (prey) by scent, sniffing the ground to find out where the animals have been.
They have excellent night vision and are able to move unnoticed. Partridge cats hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is removed from the main population from which they originate (such as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat), they will again find themselves in a different environment from the one they were in before.
The new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much, still requiring the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which just means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans inhale, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their own food from sunlight by means of photosynthesis.
We use plants to build our homes and make our clothes. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals could not live.
Mosasaurus was the top predator on the food chain of its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw has over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue, his diet included shellfish, big fish, mosasaurs, and he could have been a cannibal himself.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would not have been able to withstand it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual feasts involving wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of marsupial known as a hazelnut.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides and ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe from the Americas, or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a main temple that was considered the home of the deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner chamber into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, also enough ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were just open counters facing the street; stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan so timber was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
IF YOU have seen the film National Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Engraved on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776. The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for tampering.
So, it is possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting had liberated the north of France, but still the south was not free.
It was controlled by the Vichy French, who were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of baking with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who work together and live and work as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or like a city, and it also defines the size of society.
City states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture depends on the transmission of knowledge over many generations, a continuing cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures frequently disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to enforce taxes, and, lacking a national executor or judiciary, they relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all their acts.
It also had no authority to pass tax laws and rates between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be changed and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were frequently absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in International games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago" because of the cluster of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century when European sailors passed by to take the island's name as Ilha Formose, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base southwest of Taiwan, and transformed native grain production practices by hiring Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Policy, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been superseded by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates movement while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was placed under the spotlight.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian faith has bound European states together despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power affected everyone, from the king down to the common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary endowment is there specifically for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question this premise.
Shortly after the outbreak of riots, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective; it has cut off vital military and civilian supplies, though the blockade has broken generally accepted international laws through several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined in international waters to prevent any ships from entering large swathes of the ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period which occurred in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
After the Revolution, professions were also open to male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
Dieselfe applies to the military, as the military's rank is now based on caliber, rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He regularly visited a cave that became known as Hira on the Mount of Noor (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, and rests atop one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if one knew it existed.
Nothing is to be seen but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the death of Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The  up arc mark looks like a  V and the  down arc mark looks like a  parenthesis or a  square without its bottom side.
Up means starting at the tip and pushing the bow, and down means starting at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pulling the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own notes, but remember that the printed lines are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to flee back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris while surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the protesters waved the head of a royal killed at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to settle a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds driven by the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological-pressure or technological necessity in a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic accompanied by scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most disruptions of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces effects on society that are native, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass vehicle ownership also leads to accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture arose that were tied to that environment, and these things, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
The status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices whose value was higher than that offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25 to 30 per year.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of the time was because of the Crusades, people began to use knots to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce just enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, bi-directional organic system that preserves seeds native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively easy techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of being neglected by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, which include fashions, manners, and informal language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults as they grew up through neglect, adverse circumstances, or intentional abuse.
Some wild children have been hooked by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment is due to parental rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some lived on their own in the wilderness.
When a feral child is raised entirely by nonhuman animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost entirely that of the particular caretaker animal, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Steering is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are beginning to use a new learning method, such as a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Stewards can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of steward but so is the little pin man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Steers are in the software and are intended to question, speed up, and explain procedures to students who would find the process difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that is the reality.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that have been suspended in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and rewards approach.
For example, learning and socializing are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) examined audience responses to websites, they identified Personal engagement and continued relationships as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretations of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is reported that one can detect when a person is lying by correctly interpreting the microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his documentary, The President's Speech, showed how people who were unable to understand the speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately estimate sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plants available there.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant sources to access would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only easily digestible but provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in a way similar to the way some chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you catch yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to put it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids, (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), before bedtime, which forces one to get up so that you can urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is correlated with the amount of stress in his body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force that is present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended by the mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is aroused through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, led by the USSR and the U.S. With the end of the war and clashes of system, process and culture leading to the countries falling out.
Within two years of the end of the war, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in real time, by proxy troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman bridgehead.
Somehow, these plans were foiled overnight, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Expedition of WWII. The Americans attempted to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mostly used U-boats, probed to stop the traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany might well have been able to conquer Britain as it could have conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were commonly kept in herds that walked over the hills and other grazing areas, and were tended by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more ubiquitous sheep herders. These methods of herding are still used today.
Washing tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wash tracks were mostly parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to do so at greater speeds and with greater loads than it would take to do so on the almost rougher roads of the day.
Early enough, crossbeams were inserted to hold the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if there was an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more finishing of the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first pure iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Two-legged specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to combat some of the future suffering.
It is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we are not looking for a temporary solution, we should go to the root of the problems and we should make them harmless.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and mankind's excessive lifestyle.
After passing through Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing press of John Dunlap.
By night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the Independence Hall lawn on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap whips are known to be the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first - aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or home of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may choose to develop an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parenting so that another couple may adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works by means of a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although not alone, experimentation, and an experiment in a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and take observations also directs scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external stimulus.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the environment, including plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studies of information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and learn about and photograph the orangutans.
Each morning, people leave the small villages in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplace is the area from which they have just moved.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science points out that this massive carbon economy has affected the stable conditions of the biosphere that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed lands, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, a study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, ratios are established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of ride-hailing facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back on the body.
This gives them a wider variety of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are the hedgehogs and the day flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believe the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, for the Earth does not feel as if it is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of many uses operating in states where Latin is regularly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and these can all be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
These were more like the four stages of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he theorized that they could change into new forms that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon, may also exist.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in that dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil's status and use declined as newer writing methods were adopted.
People now write messages on account screens, and they don't need to get near a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer passes.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's almost like pushing a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they break apart with little or no stimulus.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km thick at the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/ or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that causes them to want the things they do and the good in their environment that causes them to do or not do certain good.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior may emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to take disciplinary action, to evaluate employee performance, to assign responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team was doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a rift between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams meet at different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards there for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process to create a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments of an organization, creativity and intelligence can come through.
As a result, an organization's process works together to overcome the bottleneck and can lead to a new innovation process to serve the customer's needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006) explained the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of work performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, so it narrows the field of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, tears, and tumors affect performance and, in some cases, alter some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore the brain's structures and processes as never before.
These provide us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Al has a strong connotation with science fiction, Al forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and queries as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is also built into various home computer and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a good way to reflect on a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their drive to the state capital, every year the website is remodeled, but old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
Web journals can also help improve students' writing skills. While students regularly begin their web journaling experience with sloppy language usage and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the weblog writer begins to pursue improved writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging forces student to become more knowledgeable about the world around them.) The need to nurture the interest of the crowd inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as to express their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and contains a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and surrounding area.
All of these things and more characterize Ontario as more Canadian than outsiders perceive it to be.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in its own right.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it became firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it is one that does not look expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences may cause them to feel harassed, and that it is not uncommon to be stalked, grabbed for the arm, and so forth.
Be firm in turning men away, and do not be afraid to stand up for your rights (Cultural differences or not, that does not make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca, founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting stores to shop in all of Morocco.
To the old Medina it is easy to find places that have traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan cookware, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of excesses, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the town's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is fairly safe, any visit outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the jumping off point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished town, though it has a reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the dangers of the desert sands.
This was one of the main stopping points during Henry Louis Gates' special PBS program, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arab flair than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-eastern part of South Africa and follows the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 (19,500 sq mi) and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card that grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a sparkling column chart accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best scenery of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront across the river.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's rural development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonists took for themselves and so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast to Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that falls in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just halophyte swamps - they include some of the last remaining states of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one - third is covered in water / marsh areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted goats in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going in an easterly direction, depart for Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is suggested that a person buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and sturdy.
Shared rental cars are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paru (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 272 feet [83.0 m] and are 1,900 feet [378 m] long, with two lanes 12 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September of 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group to inhabit the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they inhabited the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indians", was born as a result of a skirmish between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is the December polo tournament in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will be generally accepted anywhere in the islands and inside Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also regularly accepted.
In the outlying islands, credit cards may well not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency will be accepted; ask the owners in advance to determine what the accepted method of payment would be.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures barely go below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards away from bears, wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
No matter how tame they may appear, buffalo, deer, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, thousands of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a proper distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval stand in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British warship, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the village caused the death of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland stretches across two harbours.
North Shore beaches (in North Havre district) face the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and most have shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Rylaan beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good range of shops along the edge of the beach.
The main local beer is Number One, it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better shipped.
The local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
To Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso,' cappuccino is served with cream piled up (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is equal to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many voyages are made to the reefs throughout the year, and damage to the reef from any of these causes is rare.
Still, take advice from authorities, obey all notices, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they very rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have somewhere to lounge when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it impossible to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the discussions for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or inquiries should go through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
For some music festivals, the largest number of attendees decide to camp on the grounds, and most see this as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action, you'll have to get in early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that while music on the main stages may come to an end, there may be sections of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the North Baltic region in winter, be sure of the cabin's location, as it makes a lot of noise for those most affected to go through the ice.
Saint Petersburg boat trips include time in town. Ride passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos usually make a great effort to maximize the amount of money spent by guests. Windows and bells are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
To keep to their point of departure and to keep guests in a good mood, they usually have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness affects your judgment, and all good gamblers recognize the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive over mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subfreezing temperatures.
Friction on icy and snowy roads is very low, and you cannot drive as if you were on a bare tar road.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall quickly in a short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or wind - borne snow or by condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari used popularly refers to overland travel to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and camels, tend to get too close to carts, and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "forest walk", "walking safari", or "walking") consists of a walk of a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until June 2020 for when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000 with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a cast iron and ironing board available for borrowing, even if there is none in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like to wear socks with irons, try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the material (otherwise it may shrink or, in extreme cases, be scorched).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to them in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods, exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, where it frequently enters deserted inland terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your distance: steep gradients, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
Speed limits are markedly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, cell service here is better than many other parts of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are still delicious, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit pie is common, with apples baked in pies throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer months.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often paired well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich dough biscuits, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region you are in.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is common in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that includes a wide variety of local dishes from across the nation.
However, when used with further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originally from central and eastern parts of mainland Java.
Javanese food now freely available across the archipelago is characterized by simply flavored dishes, the prominent flavoring for Javanese food being peanuts, hot peppers, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Beams are for supporting the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may pose safety risks due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a horse throws the rider off and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged along as the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, there are several safety measures that can be taken.

Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski boomers" who plan entire vacations to ski at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings dating back as far as 5,000 B.C. depict skiers!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski tours: This activity may also be called indoor skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to, but does not include, alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires tighter skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will cover somewhat greater distances than by walking  but only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in neat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would have meant going through visa applications and passport control points multiple times.
The Schengen area, however, operates somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
By having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for each of the Schengen member countries separately, and you save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for whether manufactured items are antiques or not. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products may be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Branchcraft is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to others with many other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi are involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry but have survived on fishing, hunting, or similar industries, using the reindeer mostly as a pack animal.
Many Sámi now work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi territory.

You may also like to consult the advice of states other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations from Europeans or Arabs.

The views presented are far more superficial, broad, and oversimplified than the more extensive information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.

Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include heavy snow brought by strong winds, heavy snowfall, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environments course" will most likely yield the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days and will include a role-play, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment operations overseas should ensure that they have valid documents for the return trip.
The eagerness of governments to issue passports that do not indicate gender (X) or documents that are updated to match a coveted name and gender varies.
Foreign governments' willingness to honor these documents is just as variable.
Searches at security checkpoints also became more intrusive after the September 11, 2001 era.
Preoperative transsexual people should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return of the flow of waves that break off from the shore, usually at a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is more concentrated at some deeper parts, and a rapid jet stream to deeper water may be formed there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue when one tries to swim backward against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to move somewhere where you will not be caught again, depending on your skills and whether you were spotted, and perhaps wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock arrives earlier than culture shock (there is less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to the new culture find it difficult to readjust to their native culture.
By the time you return from overseas, you have already adjusted to the new culture and lost some of your customs from your home culture.
When you first went overseas, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers must adjust in a new land.
People should not expect that patience and understanding are also very much needed for travelers returning home.

The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km (75 mi) north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the settlement of House of Stars.
Others, including Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula merge here into the plateau, and then emerge again from the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.

In remote areas, where cell phone service is lacking, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not a common replacement for a cell phone, because you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by shippers, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about joining the service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year to travel and learn.
These are especially popular with school leavers, and allow them to take a year off, without compromising their education.
In many cases, by enrolling in a bridge year course abroad, your chances of getting into higher education back in your home country are higher.

Finland is a great boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any hunt, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boat rides are a national time-driven activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is consistent with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in Holland the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises usually include extended vacation stays.

For some, understanding how something about an airplane works and what happens during a flight may help to overcome the fear based on the unknown or being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies had their own planes on some routes, but for the other routes and smaller firms, the problem was a problem.
If they ship these goods by air freight, unloading and customs on some routes can take days.
The only way to get through this faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
As such, however, it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, expect to pay up to four times the normal rate for economy and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of arriving at a destination quickly and comfortably, and their bill is accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the space by scratching marks or graffiti into the structures.

Within the same guidelines, men are expected to wear trousers that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed by every user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing the skirts.

Since the arrival of mankind in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, since the sky is dark almost all the time.
