Although an experimental vaccine has shown the ability to reduce the death rate from Ebola, to date, no drugs have been clearly shown to be an effective treatment for the existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, showed promise in the field at first, but formal studies have indicated that it has less than expected benefit in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other drugs to it.
USA Gymnastics endorses the United States Olympic Committee letter and agrees with the strong need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.

Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but it provides details that fossils do not usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers are chestnut-colored on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed body, called a rachis, but had other features of the feather - beards and barbels - researchers thought that the rachis was likely a more recent evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or irradiation. The researchers suggest that although this is a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows that it is the feathers of an older dinosaur and not the inner and thin feathers of a chick.
Researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the adult's feathers and not the bird's.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, early yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected the insurgent Daesh (ISIL) militant group was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun runs according to the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system was found to be enabled by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and the radius are used together to determine a star's Rosby number, which relates to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rosby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

Much of the work was theoretical, but the program was written to encourage observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team knew would be caused by the strong force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon's pull on the earth causes the ocean to rise and fall, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have also concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter affects its counterpart.
This theory holds that a large portion of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of limbo, and is made up of very small particles.

Their warm behavior is not as stable as that of the large caves on Earth that often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with that of deep-seated holes in the ground", says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is already a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, putting a printed piece of paper stating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the list of qualified voters.
French election law is rather strict in codifying procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be made visible to voters and observers so that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the ballot and so that no envelopes are added except to those who are duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. At night, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their race, and 45 of the 117 skiers failed to qualify for the Giant Slalom race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Second Inspector General D K Aray said, "We arrested the five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop".
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car struck it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed as emergency crew members were ejecting the driver from his red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred again to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
He was held in custody while awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be dismissed because his picture was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scotland's justice system is different and courts have come to the view that the publication of the images has the potential to be discriminatory.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University observes that "porters seem to be walking on the brink of disaster when they post photos etc. of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which handles the entirety of all prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comment would be made at least until the trial.
The document, as revealed, refers to a border dispute, which Palestine has sought to settle based on borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics are estimated to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations and to the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands the maintenance of a military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
Pest control supplementary test shooters are carefully supervised by rangers, as the test is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS's Executive Director of Conservation and Park Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the new Provisional Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the withdrawal of the CEP as part of preparations to take the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-administration protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due as late as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of the defective iPod have been reported, causing six fires in all and leaving four people partially paralyzed.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Transport and Industry (METI) says that it has been aware of 27 accidents involving appliances.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The minister responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "really disappointing".
The Mariana earthquake occurred at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The office for emergency management of the Northern Marianas said that no injuries were reported in the country.
Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman kidnapped Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages were rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead to date.
Six captives, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers replaced an elderly woman who needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the medical field.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began to investigate the early sensation of childbirth in his spare time.
His research shows that when a hormone is administered it can accelerate the aging of the lungs of the fetus in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators had recovered two 'black boxes' of flight data on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by fellow rebels.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Queen of Succulent. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two months. She was unfortunately as unique as she was. A brave woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna is as weird as I am...maybe more so...I love her and I'm obsessed with her...I wish she was in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the federal election in 2010, objections to Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign in the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed held this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At either end of the survey, 29 percent of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to swim the 100 and 200 freestyle and the three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but because of her previous experiences, her physical strength was called into question.
He could not take the drugs needed to relieve the pain he felt because they were banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of the water supply to the earth along with the organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists have long sought to understand how planets, especially the Earth, formed as a result of long-ago collisions with comets.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He called the news "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is speculated to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to previous ground-based radar technology to help air traffic controllers identify aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
Concerns over lack of transportation have raised the possibility of being forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports on the development of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species underwent evolution in just two generations, although this process is believed to have lasted longer, due to crossbreeding between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched to form thin wires, which can be twisted and braided, and it can be hammered or rolled to form pliers.
It could be made so thin, and it could be glued to other metals, that it was once used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice varies in color according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ion (the H in pH) in the chemical being measured.
Hydrogen atoms consist of only one proton apart from its electron, and the separate hydrogen ion is usually called a proton.
Mix two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, grind them into a ball.
Moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and produce a skin-like rash.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of the funnel system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of a public bathroom where men and women shared a common area.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and returns it almost immediately.
The satellite is launched into space by rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of our light and is visible.
It takes a large rocket 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It has provided us with trains, automobiles, and many other means of transportation.
Next came many other cats of the same size that devoured animals of different sizes from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including stray cats) eat more and more small victims such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is having a proper job or a special job to avoid competition from each cat.
Lions are the most sociable of cats, living in large groups called pride.
Prides consist of one to three related older males, as well as up to thirty females and young lions.
The women were often closely related to one another, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behave like wolf or dog packs, animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also extremely aggressive toward their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (though not so well), swim, jump long distances and carry five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, the only four cats with the ability to bite.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar of strength, but more like a phrase of cheerful, shouting words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals. It will catch monkeys, snakes, lizards, and birds if it can. Almost all the animals the ocelot seeks are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and seek out prey by sniffing, sniffing, and sniffing at the ground.
They have night vision, which enables them to see clearly in the dark, and they also operate in stealth. Ocelots catch their prey by adapting to their environment and then grasping their prey.
If a small group of organisms (a small population) is isolated from its main population of origin (such as if it goes to a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different place from its origin.
This new vulnerability has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different characteristics or adaptations to be strongly competitive than they previously needed.
The original population has not been changed in any way, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be classified as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the production of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans expel (that is, supposedly exhale).
Plants synthesize their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also offer shade.
We build our homes from plants, we own our clothes from plants, we eat almost all of our food from plants, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaurus is the top predator of its time, so it fears nothing, except other mosasaurus.
Its long jaws have 70 incisors, including an extra row above its jaw, meaning that no one can escape anyone who can bite it.
We cannot be sure, but it may have developed a milking tongue, eaten lizards, large fish, and other reptiles, and may even have become a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not have been able to conquer it.
While many of their dishes are familiar to us, the Romans also had their own extraordinary dishes prepared on the grass, including pork grass, paboreal, dumplings, and a type of roach called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor man and the woman ate sitting down in chairs, the rich man wanted to have stools together where they could sit facing down while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine may have been untouched by the foods that made their way to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians placed a central temple, or house, in front of each of their gods.
People would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to cater to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to form part of temples.
The top of the tower was a unique sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house became less important.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the backyard; shops were open dispatches facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the price of timber was very high.
In the long saga of the Norse, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling farther west, he saw Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever he discovered, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', many differences exist between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may have imagined that a map of wealth was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a back inscription, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one can be sure of its authorship, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (it measures 29Â3⁄4 inches by 24Â1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, perhaps the brief note was put there to serve as a mark.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent wars liberated Northern France, but its south was still not free.
It was under the control of the French "Vichy", people from France who had allied themselves with the Germans in 1940 and had become allies of the occupiers rather than enemies of them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned back toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture that is shared by a very large group of people who live and breed, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also in some sense indicates the size of society.
City-states are the origin of nations. Civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a continuous footprint of culture and equitable distribution.
Secondary cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - Congress as its sole constituent under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to levy taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it relies on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have the power to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Articles require general approval from all states before they can be amended and states do not take the central government seriously and so often do not have representatives.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports were introduced to the Northern regions, and Italians competed in international games and Olympic events.
The country of Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's island group, Japan is often called "the archipelago" because of its geographical location.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when European explorers recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of native grain production practices and providing employment for Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Pichu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Wall of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format worldwide for fixed lenses is 35 mm, which became the primary film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but more importantly, digital camera image sensor formats have inherited its aspect ratio.
The 35 mm format is in fact, seemingly confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is exactly 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) approximate or equal this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-neglected rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates excitement while maintaining a level of order in a picture.
This states that the most effective area for the main subject is at the center of the lines dividing the image into three vertical and horizontal (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion had held the states of Europe in its grip despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the king down to the common man.
One of the basic Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are there for that specific purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being met.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital supplies for the military and civilians, although this barricade violates the generally accepted international law that has been codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire stretch of ocean, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing culture of most citizens and of the nation was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wished to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a distinctive way of showing the different periods; each Chinese period or each family in power was a particular dynasty.
Between each dynasty was also a period of provincial schisms, the best known of which was the Three Kingdoms period that occurred during the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, fierce warfare took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died competing for the highest position in the luxurious palace at Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the nation belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution the jobs were opened to all male applicants who were given the opportunity to succeed the most ambitious and successful.
The same can be said of the military because instead of army ranks being based on class, they are now based on combat proficiency.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had developed a deep interest in things beyond this worldly life. He often went to the cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (light) for his meditation.
the cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not so easy to find even if someone knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
Nothing but clear, beautiful skies and many surrounding mountains can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has many pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), many small spires, many temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, spires, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward sloping" mark looks like a V and the "downward sloping" mark resembles a staple or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the end and push the handle, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the handle) and pull the handle.
The upper whistle often produces a weaker sound, while the lower whistle is louder and more emphatic.
Feel free to write your own marks with a pencil, but note that the printed marks for the stroke are there for musical purposes, so they should generally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on the 6th of October 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The King and Queen were forced to keep the windows of their chariot tightly shut by the rain.
On one occasion a member of the crowd shook the head of the chief of the royal guards who had been executed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war costs of the imperialist United States in its occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds sold in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the excess profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people will be the main benefit of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that prompted the formation of the order.
The period in which the events take place is often called the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a very wide range of theoretical pursuits, from the push of technology or the technological urge to the precise understanding that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the very advancement of technology follows a direction beyond cultural or political power, and that technology has "effects" on societies in nature, rather than being conditioned by society.
For example, it could be said that the automobile is the driving force behind the construction of roads.
However, the national road network would not be a profitable business if it were for only a few vehicles, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The possession of more cars leads to higher rates of road accidents, which has led to the invention of new health care techniques for repairing broken bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, coming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography developed, and these, being in harmony with the social area, were preferable to unjustly imposed laws.
In the way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as a center of wealth began in 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century due to the fact that Christian conquerors or Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were valued even more than the Byzantine market could provide.
This was the time when the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the silent means of communication, western fashions can be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great advances of that time was the Crusades, when people started to use buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming to grow enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Trans-biological agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds native to the eco-region along with crop rotation or other supposedly simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the value of socialization is to base a number of negative characteristics on the fact that children are not taught good adult manners as they grow up through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse.
Some runaway children have been previously incarcerated by people (often their own parents); in other cases this abandonment of the child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who have had limited social contact from an early age may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or left.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to live in the forest by themselves.
When fully raised by animals, the puppy exhibits behaviors (in accordance with physical limitations) that are almost identical to those exhibited by the animal that cares for it, such as fear or coldness toward humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to facilitate and make learning interesting, support formulation does more than this.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support tool that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience using for example a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, i.e., a teacher is a scaffold form as well as Microsoft Office's Clippy.
Virtual support frameworks are built into the software and are intended to ask, suggest, and explain techniques that might have been difficult for the student to deal with on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a myriad of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to bullying.
No child should ever grow up in a situation where they are unattended, caring, and teachable, but they are there.
We consider Social Houses to be a safe haven for these children.
Our welfare system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, continuing education, and reliable health care.
The foster home was to provide all the necessities that were not available in the former home from which they were taken.
The Internet has combined elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet make way for additional forms of uses and gratifications techniques.
For example, "study" and "socialising" have been suggested as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting tiny expressions, facial movements that occur within a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that a person can determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting the small expressions of his speech.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The Speech of the President, indicated how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still assess loyalty correctly.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be the same in animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutation can add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the society of varieties actually in use.
Separation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino-acid requirements from plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest to extract plant resources are the proteins in the leaves and vegetables, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (birds, rabbits, eggs) are not only easily digested, but they provide a rich supply of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savanna monkeys do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep period and falling back asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using relatively quiet alarm time to regain consciousness without being awakened.
If you find yourself changing your bedtime clock, it may be placed on the other side of your room, to force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms require drinking plenty of water (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which prompts one to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress on his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that exists. Every person has the potential to find complete peace and stability.
The only thing that prevents this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended by the path of the love of the divine and by the myriad techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all lovers.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of emptiness) is awakened by means of yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. Through the mental depiction of various gods, energy pools are purified, chakras become active and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany became an enemy of all during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, conflicts in systems, processes and culture led to the disunity of the countries.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had become rivals and the Cold War had begun.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be fought by real proxy armies in theaters of war from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was in ruins, and the only hope was to retreat and reinforce along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and occupied Belarusian and Ukrainian territories after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international agreements, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of products is the best method of all for moving large numbers of people and products across the oceans.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country can maintain the ability to transport its people and its products, while at the same time, preventing your enemy's ability to transport their people and their products.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII (World War II), when the Americans tried to smuggle men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy, whose main ships were U-boats, was trying to stem this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have conquered Britain as it had done most of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
The young goats were often placed in herds that grazed in the mountains or other pastures, often tended by shepherds who were often children or young men, similar to the more well-known shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although the carts were made of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull faster on them and to pull larger loads than on the slightly more rugged roads.
Trabees were early used to keep the rails fixed, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be better served by having a narrow piece of iron overhead.
This practice became widespread, but steel caused the wooden wheels of chariots to become more common.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking, which humans began to do upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (i.e. upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as they had been accustomed to.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dated 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that is less damaging to our environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
It is similar to treating the symptoms in many cases, but if we do not want a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problems and stop them from working.
It is clear enough that the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been aggravated by overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyles of people.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten borrower signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap prints".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the backyard of the Statue of Liberty on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not believe that they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are so many things about birds that are still similar to those of the dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk with their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in current use are based on the control of information encoded by binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally sufficient if immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific instructions for the first-line treatment for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists informally for this group of insects.
This term is broadly applied to the ancient knowledge of the Suroth, which were insects well adapted for human habitation.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are long-term dependents of those born after they are born, adapted to live in the nest or cocoon of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it would not be in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a baby.
A couple may decide to adopt their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to find out how the world works by means of the scientific method, which in fact guides most scientific research.
Not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers turned their attention to the classical texts and, in particular, to the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific subjects, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found it had strayed far from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in body structure and behavior are highly dependent on what is going on inside their bodies and on their production by the biological clock.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not simply responses to external seasonal cues, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that keep the time of free-floating cycles going even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are cells for sexual reproduction.
Only mutations in the cells of the microbial family can be passed on to offspring, while mutations anywhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the flora and fauna of the forest.
Examples of practical activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying environmental information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and studying the Bornean orangutans.
Every day, people leave the country's small towns by car to go to their workplaces and drive past others whose workplaces are their places of origin.
In this dynamic transportation of commuters all humans are somehow connected to, and support, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this vast coal economy has stripped the biosphere of its one stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone is concerned about transportation systems.
In the developed world, you will likely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems have such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers really incompetent? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Sad to say, analyzing traffic flow is not easy because driver behavior cannot be estimated with scientific certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to focus within a fixed range; thus, traffic flow is also fixed and can be estimated mathematically.
To better describe traffic flow, relationships have been made between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) weight, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and management of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, a skill that helped them to catch their prey more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along with the body.
This gives them a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are moths and flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
A few people believe that he is right but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and also the other stars).
This seems significant, since it is not so uncomfortable to think that the Earth is moving, is it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than 8 times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles [6.4 km] wide.
The entire 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building with stone did not cease until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never defeated in their size and in the technical prowess of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the clocks of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its law and official communications.
Italian was also the everyday language of most of the people working in the state while Latin was often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since all of them can be found in nature in native forms and easily mined with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle held that all matter was composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
The four states of matter (in the same order) are more similar: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also postulated that these become new things to form what we see.
Alloys are usually mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that many elements in the periodic table and some of them are also metals (such as calcium and potassium) and can be mixed with other metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that have a mixture of a few nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. Everything is made up of tiny things called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small - trillions upon trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new ways of writing came into existence, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and to less useful uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, never having to go near the keyboard.
Only when something new comes along can one know what can happen to the keyboard.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy must combine to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Perhaps it is as if a heavy cart were being wheeled up a hill, so the splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms are those with an unbalanced number of protons and neutrons meaning that they tend to disappear when there are few or no matching numbers of protons and neutrons.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick nearby and 100 km thick farther away.
It is thinner under the marshes and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lava in the visible part of the world because the earth's crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories center on finding what motivates people or what attracts their attention.
These theories suggest that people have some particular needs and/ or desires that they embrace as they age.
These theories are about what drives some people to desire what they do and what factors in their environment drive them to do or not to do things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the male colleagues" (or females).
Such a manager has difficulty making decisions that are not popular, administering discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an anonymous individual who feels that he should change everything the group is doing and do it to him.
After all, the leader is really responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This trait often results in misunderstandings between leaders and other team members.
Virtual groups are also subject to the same standards of well-being as regular groups, but with subtle differences.
Members of the virtual group often serve as a point of contact for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of the general group because their groups can meet according to different time zones that their local administration may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinctive feature of the virtual group.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team assigns standards to each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of developing a learning organization? One goal for actively implementing an organization's learning concepts is innovation.
If all resources are used effectively throughout the active department of an organization, creativity and ingenuity will be manifested.
As a result, the process of the organization working together to overcome a barrier may lead to a new inbound process to service customer need.
Before an organization can have innovative ideas, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as of shared knowledge and learning as an organization.
Anghel (2006), explains Continuum as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating learning capacity. They therefore narrow the field of research and make it more precise.
Scientists in their research have promoted the connection between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, traumatic experiences, injuries, and odd bumps affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The proliferation of new technology has allowed us to see and examine properties and processes of the brain that were previously unseen.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to build patterns of thought that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which is about the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves building machines that will automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
AI tasks include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer reviews and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as has been done in software applications for many home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Often the teacher wants to take his students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers the solution by means of virtual educational tours, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing an educational trip in a virtual way is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with the classroom.
For example, every year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, every year the website is re-owned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help to improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this is usually altered by the presence of readers.
Since students are often the most criticized by viewers, the blogger started to improve her writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces the student to be more intelligent about the world around them". The need to cater to the interest of the audience opens students up to being inquisitive and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way to foster collaboration, and encourage students to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "may enable students to be more critical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can determine their positions in the context of what others have written as well as formulate their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant, bilingual capital and features many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the far south is the Niagara Escarpment and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more highlight Ontario as what outsiders would consider Canadian.
The vast northern area is less populated and the rest is almost deserted.
For a population comparison that surprises many: More African Americans live in the United States than citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and can be considered a continent in terms of biodiversity.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it became very important in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The Sahel borders the region to the north, and to the south and west is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women traveling say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It may also help to wear a ring (as long as it does not look too expensive.)
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they may consider touching and the normal to be followed, held in the arm, and so forth.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, it is still unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established bases for trade there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookah, and all kinds of dresses, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in its easternmost neighbourhood of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the town's streets, particularly in the town center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be explored to understand the nature of the fighting that is going on in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The average (local) charge is ~500 Congolese Francs for a one-time ride.
Along with its difficulty of access, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a bustling village, although its reputation is the reason it is a popular stop for tourists, and it has an airstrip.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main destinations of Henry Louis Gates in his PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is unlike any other in the country, as it is more Arab-style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Buwaya River.
The park covers 19,500 kmÂ2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a variety of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the pride of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a fee for daily conservation and park admission.
It may also be beneficial for a person to purchase a Forest Card, which will give access to either select parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and to the area that many tourists recognize as a major destination.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a sparkling bar chart that is visible because of the presence of Victoria Harbour water.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the straight coast of Kowloon.
Most of the development of Hong Kong Island cities is in the thick reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the area that the British occupiers claimed as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal marsh in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the provinces of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that is on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just cattle pastures - they include some of the last remaining hopes of the mighty forests that once covered the Ganga plain.
The Sundarbans covers 3,850 kmÂ2, of which one third is underwater/wetland areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 409 Royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 bat-footed foxes in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japan's small, comfortable, and durable Coaster Buses.
Taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby areas, such as Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two passages 3.50 m wide.
The height of the space under the bridge is 15 meters. Completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as relatively nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for a living.
The Chaco region became home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycura and the Payagua, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, once called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the conflict between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous tribes.
The Spanish began a period of conquest that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polar field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and fights can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the Western FIC store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and on Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currency may be obtained; check with the owners in advance to find out what is a good method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so buy currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures over +30°C are common.
Winter can have a deceptive quality: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel cooler than what the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rain" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wild animals are nevertheless fierce and should not be fed or tamed.
Park officials say to keep at least 100 yards [100 yards] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 yards] from all other wild animals!
No matter how small they may look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, many visitors are injured because they do not keep proper distance. These animals are large, fierce, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, it should be noted that odors attract bears and other predators, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of the famous naval battle of 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser, with nearly 200 Americans and Germans killed.
During the freedom struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the assassination of the most important chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is situated between two ports.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these are sandy beaches where it is safe to go down into the water, most with shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhood of Central Auckland.
These once beautiful beaches are frequented by families and have a fine array of shops that line the shore.
The main local beer is 'Numero Uno', it is not a complicated beer, if not pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be bought, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better kept in good condition on the trip.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are nervous.
To Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A thin black is 'espresso', a cappuccino comes with a high stack of cream (not bubbles), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is by Belgian standards, and the fruit-juice drinks are expensive but delicious.
Many reef visits take place throughout the year, and disasters from any reef-related cause are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The dikya emerged near the coasts and near the mouths of rivers from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that they have a place to stay once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible for you to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites, through the travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport pick-up or even flight-hotel packages.
They can also reserve the reservation for you if you need time to study the offer or take care of other paperwork for your destination (e.g., visa).
Any changes or requests should be made first to the representative of the travel agency and not to the hotel itself.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on the premises, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, get there early to get accommodations near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, there may be parts of the celebration where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
When visiting the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the sleeping house, as going into the ice can cause quite severe noise for those who are intentionally affected.
Sea trips to Saint Petersburg require a stay in the city. Travelers are exempt from visa requirements (see rules).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by visitors. Windows and clocks are often missing, and exits may be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers, to keep the guests feeling good, and to keep them in the area.
A few places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all serious gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or on mountain roads should consider the possibility of fog, frost, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as smoothly as on asphalt.
During hail storms, enough hail to keep you afloat can fall in a very short time.
The ability to see through falling or falling snow or condensation or ice on the car windows may also be limited.
On the other hand, icy and wet conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is not disturbed all year round.
Wildlife viewing or safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey by land to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and the usual equipment can provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy from time to time, and you can see them more often with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "hiking") involves hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Several events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, having already hosted the 1964 games.
If you already booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing ¥7,000.
Washing wet clothes can help to dry them out. Many hotels have a washstand and a seating area, although they do not have one in the room.
If there are no usable plugs, or if you do not want to wear polished socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (this causes the clothes to shrink, or in extreme cases, to chafe).
There are various methods of purifying water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others, more than a minute is required.
The effectiveness of remedies varies, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals unfamiliar to them in their region of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread parasites, or transmit infections.
The pathogens themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully infect or kill humans, usually do not pass as pests.
Duty free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods duty free at certain locations.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save large sums of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The stretch of road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, which often passes through remote wooded land.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: there are steep, narrow, and sudden turns.
The posted posted speeds are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/ h) - and strict adherence to them is more important than not.
Surprisingly, though, mobile phone service here is stronger than along many other routes, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are delicate and varied, like those of its neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are cooked to make year-round pastries, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts also feature prominently in many German bread products.
If you want some small but soft breads, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on what the region calls them.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the landlocked regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, gata is commonly used.
With 17,000 island choices, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses the wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, when used without further qualification, the term usually means food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.

The supports on either side of the horse serve as support for the rider's feet.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may raise safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet being caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has one foot stuck to the handle, he may be able to jump if the horse runs. To reduce the risk, some precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear a riding boot with a tail and a smooth, curved, rounded toe.
Next, some horses, particularly the English, have safety bars that allow the stirrup to fall off the horse if the fallen rider is thrown backward.

Skiing is a major activity when traveling with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning entire ski-focused vacations in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing began in the mid-17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
Related but not generally used are the alpine styles of touring or skiing, since the latter are done on steep terrain and require more rigid skis and boots.
Consider a skiing route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover a little more distance than walking - but you will rarely reach the speed of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on the paved trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means having to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
The Schengen zone does however function in a manner similar to a country in this respect.
While in this zone, you can cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Also, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what items are made of antiques. Other tax agencies have defined products over 100 years old as antiques.

Once you are out of the current, swimming back will not be any more difficult than it normally would be.

Finland is a delightful destination for boating. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, located in lakes and islets along the coast.
On archipelagos and lakes you may not always need a yacht.
Although the islands near the continental shore and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is observed by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise is really unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Almost all the unique Baltic Cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore by boat for sightseeing you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the area is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

The easiest way to fly first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a test of standards, you can expect to pay up to four times the standard fare savings for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no reason to look for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct airline flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there are particular groups of travelers willing to pay high dollars for the privilege of arriving at a destination quickly and comfortably, and to charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÅŸinÄƒu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
