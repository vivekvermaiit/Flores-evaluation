Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but it also provides information that stone-wings generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and with a pale or carotenoid coat on the underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers have a poorly developed plumage, but have other features of the feathers  flagellum and small rays , the researchers concluded that the plumage probably developed later in the evolutionary process.
The composition of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flight but for heat or for appearance. The researchers concluded that although the specimen is a young dinosaur's tail, it shows adult feathers, not juvenile ones.
The researchers concluded that although this is the skull of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not juveniles.

The work was largely academic, but the program was designed to mimic observations of the Sagittarius constellation.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by a tidal force between the cluster's core and the Milky Way's core.
The galaxy exerts a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf as the moon traps the Earth and causes sea-level rise.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) bacterium in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In an interview, he said that he believed the new strain was "very difficult to detect and extremely dangerous because of its high mortality rate".
Some patients may have contracted the plague at the hospital, Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health workers.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 others if he comes into close contact with them.
However, the incidence of XDR-TB in all groups of patients with tuberculosis appears to be very low, at 6000 out of 330,000 patients infected in South Africa during a given period.

Their temperature behaviour is not as constant as that of large caverns on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep caverns in the Earth", said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), a team in the Department of Astrophysics and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Elections in France have generally not been very technical: voters leave the polling booths, mark the appropriate candidate on a printed piece of paper, and then stick it in an envelope.
Once the identity of the voter has been verified by officials, the voter pours the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
French electoral law documents the process quite thoroughly.
Since 1998, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no ballot boxes are present at the start of voting and that no ballot boxes are added except those from registered voters.
Candidates may send representatives to monitor the entire process, and at night, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

Adekoya was then brought before the Edinburgh Magistrates' Court on charges of murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting formal charges and trial, but the testimony of witnesses may be corrupted because her photograph has been shown in many places.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but it's not how justice works within Scotland, and courts view camera possession as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, points out that "journalists seem to be taking a dangerous path when they publish photos and other things of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is running the prosecution, has told reporters that nothing more will be released at least until a formal charge is made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border wall, which Palestine wants to build on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other subjects discussed include the future kingdom of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands that the force remain in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to keep the force in the area for only five years.
The shots in the mammography test were to be under the close supervision of the National Park Service, who monitored the test and evaluated its results.
The NPWS and the National Shooting Society of Australia (NSW) have collaborated to recruit qualified volunteers to the Shooting Society's fishing programme.
The four shooters selected for the shoot-out received extensive safety and training instruction, according to Mick O'Flynn, acting executive director of the NPWS' National Parks and Heritage Conservation Department.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as the newest member of the nine-member Committee for Electoral Reform (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended that the CEP resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Political Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of overheated iPod devices, resulting in a total of six fires, with four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The department responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "really tragic".
The quake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of any domestic disturbances.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former police officer in the Philippines held a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their long-distance bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly citizens, were released early, as were the Philippine photographs.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who needed a restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He specialized in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm births in his spare time.
His research revealed that the administration of hormones accelerated the growth of the lungs during the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black boxes'/aircraft on Wednesday.
Other actors also paid tribute to Luna's memory.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first agent, Luna fell from the night of the two moons, a bit unique, like her, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as I am... even crazier... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
The arrest was made after Prime Minister Julia Gillard campaigned for the 2010 federal election, saying she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of those polled agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In the most decisive poll of the options, 29 percent of the respondents wanted Australia to become a republic first, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100 and 200 meters sprints and the three-mile swim at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have cast doubt on his agility.
He has not been able to take the drugs that are supposed to help with the pain, since they are banned at the games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number known today on January 25.
Several parties confirmed the discovery with different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
The tail stars may have brought water to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and be the source of life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the earth, but comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rhetoric "political paper and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional public transport will be added and trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and laying facilities are unavailable on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised questions about whether the game would be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science revealed the evolution of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Scientists at Princeton University and Uppsala University in Sweden explained that the new species evolved in just two generations, a process previously thought to be prolonged by interbreeding between the terrestrial Darwin's finch, Geospiza conirostris, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in any way, and it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires that can be twisted and braided together; it can be hammered into shape; or it can be rolled into thin sheets.
It can be thinned to a great extent and then fixed to other metals, and it can be thinned to such a degree that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called 'carved manuscripts.'"
This is called the pH of a substance.
The carbon layer changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the substance is.
The acidity is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test substance.
Hydrogen ions are proteins that have lost their electrons (because a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Mix the two pieces together, and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The hand-rack will be affected by external forces that act a little oddly, forming a half-shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a water-filled latrine in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Ruins of school systems have been found in the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman culture, they were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were mixed together.
When a telephone call is made to someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite receives the call and returns it almost instantly.
Scientists use space-based telescopes because the earth's atmosphere reflects light and images of our surroundings.
A giant rocket over 100 feet [30 m] high will be used to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing it has done for us is provide us with much easier and faster transportation.
We have trains, trucks, and other forms of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and mammals.
Then there are many small felines (including pet cats) that eat considerably more of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a keel, a special task each cat is responsible for, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the felines, living in large groups called lionhearts.
Groups consist of one to three adult males and up to 30 females and young.
The mating pair is usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions behave in a similar way to wolves or dogs, animals that are strangely similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and also very lethal in their neighbor's yard.
Thus, the tiger's all-round build enables it to climb (not very well, though), swim, jump far, and take on five strong men.
The tiger is in the same genus (Cenus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four are the only cats that can howl.
The tiger's roar is not like that of a full-grown lion, but it is more like a sentence with a roaring, shouting voice.
They prey on small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, reptiles, and birds, and they prey on almost any animal that is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the partridge cat tracks and finds animals to eat (prey) by smell and to sniff out where it has walked on the earth.
They have night vision, are highly accurate in the dark, and are very stealthy in their movements.
When a small group of organisms (small animals) are separated from the main group from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain or a river, or if they move to another island, making it difficult to get back), the environment often turns out to be different from what they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new residents have needed different qualities or adaptations to be strong competitors compared to what was before.
The original inhabitants have not changed, and they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new residents adjust to their new surroundings, they will look less and less like the other residents.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two organisms will be so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
This is called speciation, but it simply means that a new species is created, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (thus exhale).
Plants produce food by using the sun and light, and they provide shade.
We build our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we eat mostly from plants, and animals can't live without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, fearing no one but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw, with more than 70 incisors and extra teeth at the top of the crown, prevented any escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a tongue, it ate turtles, a large fish, and like other mosasaurs, it may have been self-destructive.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, even the largest of the dinosaurs, such as the gray wolf, which had not entered it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had some unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a sleeping mouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the woman sat in chairs, while the rich people held banquets together and flattered themselves while they ate their food.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included the foods that were introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, there was no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each god, which was considered the god's home.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each courtyard had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the building was not considered very important.
The Hebrew family spent most of its life under the open sky.
Women made fire in the garden, tents were only open, the streets were paved with marble, and houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan was unforested, so the oak was a particularly valuable animal.
The conquest of Greenland was a disaster. Norse mythology says that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled farther west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimos were living there at the time.
Although all the countries are Scandinavian, there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
You might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the United States Declaration of Independence if you watched the movie National Treasure.
However, this is not true. Something is written on the back of the declaration, but it is not a treasury card.
The text on the back of the Declaration of Independence reads: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is on the reverse at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is evident that early in its history this large parchment scroll (75 by 62 centimeters) was rolled up for storage.
It is possible that the commemorative point was added as a marker.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated Northern France, but Southern France was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invading forces instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American troops and the Free French liberated southern France and then marched on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a very large group of people who live and work together in a community.
The word civilization is taken from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, and it also somehow defines the size of society.
Civilization involves knowledge passed down through the generations, cultural traces over time, and equitable distribution.
Small societies often disappear without leaving important historical evidence, and such cultures are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the Thirteen States formed a weak government  with the National Assembly as its only component  cf. the first constitution.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and because no federal governor or judicial authority was present, it relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its laws.
Rather, it had no authority to overturn tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states showed such disrespect for the government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, has the second-best record in the world among national teams, and Italy won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern hemisphere, and Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), Japan is the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Because of its archipelago, Japan is often referred to, geographically speaking, as an "island nation"
The origin of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a camp in southwestern Taiwan, changing the rice cultivation tradition of the natives and bringing Chinese laborers to work on the company's rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the coastal areas of Western and Northern Taiwan, and made Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, relinquishing Taiwan to Japan, which occupied the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the marshes have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of what they were like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and that work is still ongoing.
For example, the most common photographic film in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the parallel film era.
It is still produced today, but what is more, digital camera cameramen are building on its visual impact.
The 35 mm format is actually quite confusing, it's 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio with a whole number) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The very misused rule that is often relied upon about thirds is the simple principle of creating dynamics while maintaining order in a figure.
It states that the most effective location for the main axis is where the lines dividing the triangle into a vertical and a vertical line meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was being viewed with a critical eye.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united Europe despite its differences in language and customs.
Her power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are there primarily for this purpose.
The moderate authority of the church had been in power in Rome for over a thousand years, and the confusion of power and authority had caused many to doubt the accuracy of these teachings.
Shortly after the war broke out, Britain placed Germany under artillery.
The policy proved successful, halting vital military and civilian transactions, although this tactic violates generally accepted international law as established by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain spread tundra clays over international waters to prevent shipping from entering the high seas, which posed a great danger even to neutral ships.
Germany hoped for a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare because the response was limited to this flavor.
In the 1930's, the policy of peace and isolation was the dominant attitude of most countries and peoples.
After the horrors of World War I, the nations wanted to prevent such events from happening again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had a 4-cent bill in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) styled Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used a unique method to show different periods, each period in Chinese history or each dynasty was identified as a separate empire.
The periods between the empires were volatile and marked by internal disputes within the provinces, the most famous of which is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years, or the middle period between the Han and Jin empires.
During these periods, there were bitter wars between the various chieftains who contended for the crown.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles for the highest seat in the Great Hall of Xian.
Many social and political influences are at play, such as the introduction of the subway system, the transition from totalitarianism to democracy, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the nation rather than to any one ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were open to male applicants, and the most ambitious and energetic were the most successful.
The same was true of the army, for instead of being based on ranks, the army was now based on ranks.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life, and he often went to a cave, later known as Hira, on the mountain Noor (light) to meditate.
The saint himself, who stood the test of time, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
The cave is on top of a mountain north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know it is there.
There is nothing to see but the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave little of that world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, the largest of the pyramids, a small tomb, a courtyard, and the Great Sphinx are all found in the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza archaeological site in Egypt's Death Valley, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several courtyards, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up" sign looks like a V, and the "down" sign looks like a lever or a square with no bottom.
Up means to start from the top and push the bow, while down means to start from the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Usually, the sound is soft when the bow is pulled upstream, but it is louder and sharper when the bow is pulled downstream.
Enter your own notes at will, but keep in mind that the printed arrows have musical value, so usually they should be considered.
On October 6, 1789, the death-threatened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced by a group of high-ranking merchants to return to Paris.
They returned to Paris in a horse-drawn carriage, surrounded by a mob that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage doors wide open.
One of the men waved the severed head of a member of the King's bodyguard who had been killed at Versailles, before the terror of the Queen's displeasure.
The Philippines itself had to pay the war costs of American imperialism because of its conquests.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government in the United States to meet much of the expense, and the interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government was funneled through Wall Street investment banks.
The benefits of American global power were reflected in the overproduction caused by the long-term domination of the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which the order was formed.
The period in which these events took place is commonly called the Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending with the Council of Nicaea around 1500.
Technological law is a concept that encompasses a variety of ideas, ranging from technological imperatives or technical imperatives to a strong sense that human destiny is attacked by fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological imperialism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely unbound by cultural and political influences, and that technology has an equally "impact" on societies that are natural, rather than socially understood.
For example, the car might inevitably lead to a roadblock.
However, rural roads are not economically viable for the few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
The increasing number of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, which leads to new health care methods being invented to bring people together.
Romanticism was a major contributor to the cultural theory that has been passed down from such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Under the Roman system, the land shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with the land, harmonized with the community, and proved to be far superior to laws made by hand.
Just as Paris is famous as the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was the fashion capital of the Renaissance in Europe.
Its fame as a center of learning began in 400 B.C.E. and lasted until about A.D. 1100.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices that were worth more than the Byzantine market could offer.
It was at this point that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Western styles, on the other hand, may last 25 to 30 years because of the slowness of communication.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was developing its own style. One of the biggest advances that came out of the Crusades was people starting to tie clothes together with buttons.
A self-sufficient farm is an agricultural operation to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient farming often involves a simple and organic system using seeds sourced from an ecosystem along with seed exchange or other rather simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures unite as like-minded individuals who feel disadvantaged by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of self.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, nationality, caste, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that determine the cultural chemistry that is identified may be linguistic, professional, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of cultural groups often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, performance, and slang.
One of the most traditional ways of demonstrating the importance of social mobility is to support a few unfortunate cases of children who are neglected, unfortunate or deliberately abused, children who do not enjoy social mobility by adults in their upbringing.
Some animal children have been locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child's neglect by the parent's harassment resulted in severe mental or physical harm.
Abandoned or abandoned children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma.
Others are said to have evolved from animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild by chance.
When a child is raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is at least as close to that of the animal that cares for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While it may be easier and more interesting to study in a programmed way, study groups go further.
Workbooks are not a learning method, but rather should be seen as a tool to help participants engage in a new learning experience, for example, when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Workbooks can be both virtual and real, e.g. a teacher is a kind of workbook but it also applies to the small letter clipper in Microsoft Office.
Visual tutorials are built into the software and are designed to critique, invoke and explain techniques that may have been too difficult for the student to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even to rape.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and nurturing, but they do.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, continuing education, and reliable health care.
An adoptive home should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both media and personal communication.
The characteristics of the Net created an additional dimension of usefulness and convenience.
For example, 'knowledge acquisition' and 'social interaction' are cited as important drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and continuous relationships were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of supersensory, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It has been theorized that by correctly interpreting the slightest similarity, it is possible to tell whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless incapable of appreciating sincerity in a precise way.
He even suggests that such a faculty of interpreting human behavior is something that animals, such as dogs, possess.
Research in the 20th century has revealed two types of genetic variation - hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation and selection removes it from the population before the variation is expressed.
Separation and recombination drive the variation back and forth between the two contaminants with each generation.
Outside the grassland, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to those of humans to meet their amino acid needs with certain plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant sources were proteins from leaves and algae, although primates like us have a hard time digesting these unless they're salted.
On the other hand, animal food (ant, termite, egg) is not only easily digestible but also rich in protein and essential amino acids.
After all, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to that of tropical chimpanzees today.
Sleep apnea is the process of waking consciously at your usual bedtime and then falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock to sleep, move it across the room to force yourself to go out and turn it off.
Other options related to circadian rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (pure water or tea, known as diuretics) before sleep and forcing a person to go to the bathroom and urinate.
The amount of inner peace one experiences is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is, and all individuals have the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has also been influenced by the teachings of love from the Mahayana as well as a number of practices from Invarian yoga.
In its essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of higher truth) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, and vision.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is yoga, which is connected to the gods, the purification of energy circuits by imagining various gods, the activation of the power stations, and the creation of the information consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
This was to last for the next 40 years and be fought in the real world, by proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive line had been pushed aside, and the only hope was to consolidate and reorganize on the Romanian border.
However, these plans were dashed when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers attacked and formed the lines of defense for Belarus and Ukraine after the army invaded the eastern part of Poland, violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Armistice Agreement, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Ships are most effective in transporting large numbers of people and goods across ports.
The job of the fleet has been to both ensure that your country retains its ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfere with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most striking examples of this was the Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the United States tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which was mainly used for submarines, was trying to stop these transports.
Had the Allies failed, the Germans might have been able to subjugate Britain, as they had done elsewhere in Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for perhaps 10,000 years in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and ethnic groups began to store such to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that grazed the hills or other pastures, often and sometimes by goat herders, who were more often than not children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar shepherds.
By the 16th century, wagon roads were being built in England.
Although the roads for horse-drawn carriages were only paved with wooden planks, horses could still pull the carriages at higher speeds and towed heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
Early on, logs were used to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be more effective if they had iron on top.
This was normal, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
In time, the repair wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first iron railways were built.
The first known forms of transportation were successful, and two million years ago, Homo erectus (which means "upright man") appeared.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Bipedal features are found in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have begun walking on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
You can be more environmentally friendly, become involved in the environmental movement, and even take action to reduce future waste to some extent.
This is like treating symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should go to the root of the problem and reverse it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of man's advances in science and technology, but there are growing problems because of overpopulation and man's uncontrolled urge to survive.
On July 4, as soon as the Constitution had been adopted by the House, Senate President John Hancock and Senate Secretary Charles Thomson signed a handwritten draft of it and sent it to the nearby John Dunlap printing press.
That night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are called "Dunlap unicorns".
The document was read publicly for the first time by President John Nixon in the Independence Hall Park on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The oldest known copies of the shield are the 25 Dunlap Parachutes, the original handwritten copy of which has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of animals is extinct - birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
Their feet are equipped with scales and claws, they shake and use both hind legs to walk, just like the T-Rex.
Nearly all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded as binary numbers.
Binary numbers can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer language.
Symptoms such as vomiting are very common and therefore diagnosis may not be immediate.
The best indication of internal intoxication may be the presence of an open inlet with medications or toxic substances for domestic use.
Check whether the label contains instructions for emergency use for this particular toxin.
The term "toad" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This concept originates from the ancient knowledge of the wall insects, which are insects that have adapted to bite humans.
Both the robin and the wall lizard are nest lovers, wanting to make a nest in the nest.
In the United States alone, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord, and the visual system.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples may choose to put together an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the parents of the child relinquish their rights so that other parents can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by using a scientific approach, and this approach actually governs most scientific research.
This is not the only objective, for experimentation, or testing to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations, is also the guiding principle of scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science were widely accepted, including those on psychology.
As knowledge of Greek gods increased, the West lost touch with the philosophical and scientific roots of Greek culture.
Many of the breakthroughs in biology and behavior often rely heavily on the internal circuitry and its production by the life-clock.
A regular rhythm, which is not simply a response to external regular cues, has been documented in most organisms, including countless bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Life clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that keep a regular rhythm even without external interference.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to clone their own DNA with bacteria.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive fuel.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the gene being affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Mutations in one germline cell can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying nature, including wildlife.
Examples of local outdoor activities include shooting, pole-diving, photography, bird watching, and visiting a zoo to learn about the ecosystem.
For example, travel, take pictures, and learn more about the hurricanes in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive to work from small suburban areas and meet others leaving their workplaces.
In this powerful transportation hub, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this vast carbon cycle has released the biosphere from one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation, and almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developing lands, the quality of water or the deterioration of bridges is rarely the subject of such complaints.
Why do transportation systems make such complaints, why do they react daily, are the engineers just incompetent, or is there some basic principle to blame?
Traffic flow is the study of the travel of individual drivers and vehicles between two places and how they affect each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with any certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within normal limits, resulting in a certain consistency in traffic flows that can be roughly represented by mathematical calculations.
To better describe the flow of traffic, the relationship between three main properties of traffic has been defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, using their ability to fly to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a greater variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ladyflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, although many believed the opposite, that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other planets).
It makes sense, because we don't feel the earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, stretching six miles across.
In all, 20 percent of the water that flows from the earth's rivers to its estuaries comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it draws water from thousands of smaller streams.
The building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but no pyramids as large and technologically advanced as those at Giza were ever built.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
In Vatican City, Italian is used in lawmaking and public communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life for most of the people who work in the State, and Latin is used for religious purposes.
All the people of the Vatican are Catholic.
Since ancient times, scientists have known about elements like gold, silver, and copper, all of which can be found in nature in their natural form, and it's fairly easy to work them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter was composed of one or more elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four types of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they would change into new substances that form what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
The elements calcium and potassium are classified as metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also metallic pigments that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is all made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that their trillions could be seen in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it first appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing techniques, the pencil has been downgraded and its use has declined.
People now text on computer programs and never have to approach a translator.
One can only imagine what the keyboard will be like when something new comes on the market.
The principle behind the cluster bomb is that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy object up a hill, and if the core is re-cracked, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and therefore tend to decay with little or no current.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the top layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 45 miles [70 km] thick on the near side and 60 miles [100 km] thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar surface and thicker under the peninsula.
The more the crust is thin, the more likely it is that there is more of it, and the easier it is for the crust to rise to the surface.
Research is about finding out what makes people tick or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they pursue in adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about particular people that makes them want the things they want and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's two-component theory.
Generally speaking, there are two types of change that can occur when agents start working for former partners: On the other end of the spectrum, they try to remain "one of the guys" (or "girls").
Such rulers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing laws, keeping records, concealing responsibility, and holding people accountable.
The other end of the line shows an unknown party who feels that one must change everything the group has done up to this point and make the work their own.
When all is said and done, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The sample team has the same quality standards as the regular team, but there are some minor differences.
Visiting team members are often the contact persons for the nearest field group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members as their teams may need to meet at different times that their managers in each location may not understand.
The existence of the true 'visual' theorem (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of the theorem.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member belongs.
Why would companies want to go through the time-consuming process of putting learning design into practice?
When all the available resources have been exhausted by all the departments of a company, creativity and ingenuity can begin to take over.
For example, a company's collaboration in overcoming barriers can lead to new avenues of innovation to serve the interests of its customers.
For a company to become a leader, management needs to create a culture of innovation as well as information and knowledge sharing within the company.
Angel (2006) reports that companies can use Continuum computing to significantly increase their productivity.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, thus narrowing the field of study and making it much more precise.
The connection between the brain's reasoning and behavior is stimulating scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in mental functioning.
The advent of new technology allows us to see and study the structure and function of the brain as never before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build military models that help us understand processes in our minds.
AI has strong ties to science fiction, but AI is actually a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and the intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves building machines to do tasks that require intelligent behavior, automatically.
Examples include control, planning and execution, the ability to respond to customer analysis and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, where the focus is on creating solutions to real problems.
Today, AI is widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has been incorporated into many applications in home computers and video games.
Water trips are a big part of all teaching, and oftentimes a teacher is more than just the train to take students to places where buses cannot reach.
Technology offers the solution by means of excursions, where students can visit a museum, a zoo, or a fine art gallery while sitting with their class.
A joint field trip is also a good way to consider travel and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at North Carolina's Bennet School create a website every year that chronicles their trip to the state capital.
Blogs can also help improve students' literacy skills. Initially, student blogs are often full of poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of a reading group often changes that.
Since students are often the audience that criticizes the most, the blogger starts to try to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
When students blog, "they become more familiar with the world around them". The requirement to address readers' interests encourages students to be curious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way to foster collaboration and encourage students to take their studies beyond the traditional school day.
The use of blogs "can encourage students to think critically; students can use online content to both take a stand on what others are writing and to express their own views on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant, dual capital, home to many art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more demonstrate what out-of-towners find particularly Canadian about Ontario.
Large areas further north are quite rugged, and some are almost uninhabited.
A demographic comparison that may surprise some: There are more blacks of African descent in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and most isolated continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Muslim faith, and it became very popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, European influence began to be felt, and the colonial era began, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovering the route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
The province is bordered on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that women who travel claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Also, wearing a ring (but not one that looks too expensive) is helpful.
Women should realize that a culture difference can manifest itself in what they perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be chased, grabbed, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of people and fearless in your stand for what is right (cultural differences or not do not justify this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sailors in the 10th century B.C.E. It was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategically important port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan wares on the table along with tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and jewelry, but all of this is done for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets in the crater, though the central part was spared.
Although Goma is relatively safe, be sure to take all trips outside Goma to find out where the conflict is still raging in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also a base for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as one of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
The boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to travel around Goma. The usual price (within the region) is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
In combination with the difficulty of access, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for an unusual, foreign place.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, though its reputation still attracts tourists and there is an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat posed by the desertification process.
This was one of the highlights of the Special Wonders of Africa with Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city is in complete contrast to other cities in the interior, as it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems that support different animal life.
The park is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is a true gem among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, it is under constant protection and requires an entrance fee.
It may also be useful to purchase a so-called Wild Card, which grants access to a number of national parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the main destination for tourists.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have sometimes been likened to a glittering sundial, as seen from the Victoria Harbour.
The best view of Hong Kong is from the Kowloon Seashore, opposite the Spanish Steps.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban structure is concentrated in reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took as their own, and if you're looking for evidence of past colonial times, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal pine belt in the world, extending 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a forested area in the Indian subcontinent.
The forests, however, are not just pine-oak forests. They contain some of the last remnants of the mighty primeval forest that once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/mud.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted tigers.
Group buses depart from the traffic centre (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-provincial buses are often full, it is recommended that you buy your ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese buses are convenient and safe.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 277 feet [83 m] high, the bridge is 1,900 feet [378 m] long, and it has two arches that are 12 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (59 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when it is expected to be completed at the Brazilian Customs.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group in the rural area of what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who made their living by hunting and gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, or the "Great Indian Province", was formed when Spanish colonists encountered groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is well-known for its polo team and its top-ranked players.
The biggest event of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
You can also watch the smaller conventions and games held at other times of the year.
For news of the tournament and where to buy tickets for the polo tournament, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted in most parts of the island, and Stanley is also a popular destination for credit cards and U.S. bank notes.
The streets may not accept credit cards, although British and American currency may be accepted.
It is virtually impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the hot-temperate zone, where temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and hail combined make it colder than the thermometer indicated.
There is no specific "rainy" or "dry" season: the yield is similar throughout the year.
While many animals in parks are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, a minimum distance of 100 yards (320 feet) must be maintained from bears and wolves and 25 yards (25 feet) from all other wildlife.
As peaceful as they may appear, elk, deer, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack humans.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep their distance.
Also, since smells attract bears and other wildlife, avoid carrying or cooking strongly smelling food, and make sure that your tent is kept clean.
Apia, the capital of the Samoan Islands, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British battleship was sunk, with nearly 200 American and German casualties.
In the independence movement organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the killing of the chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland lies between two harbors, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor area) stretches along the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, where it is safe to swim and pohutukawa trees provide shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the first class suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family resorts with a good selection of shops along the beach.
The most popular beer in the area is Number One, which is not a complicated beer but is good and refreshing.
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more suitable for the trip.
The tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are afraid of tap water.
For Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is foreign. Short black is espresso, cappuccino comes with a bunch of cream (not cream) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is in line with Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many trips are made to the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advised precautions, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The species is found near the coast and in the northern Atlantic from October to April 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Although saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their main habitat is at the headwaters of the river north of Rockhampton.
By booking ahead, a traveler can relax knowing that he has secured accommodations when he arrives in the area.
Travel agencies often have agreements with a specific hotel, although other types of accommodation, such as camping, can also be booked through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer package tours that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and even a flight and a hotel in the same package.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain any documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Contact the travel agency for changes and other requests before you check in.
At some festivals, the majority of visitors to a music festival decide to camp on the spot, and most visitors view this as a necessary part of the experience.
If you want to be near the bay, you'll have to arrive early to get a tent near the music.
Remember, even after the music in the main venues has stopped, music may be playing in the festival areas well into the night.
Some festivals have special tented areas for families with young children.
Before embarking on a winter crossing of the Arctic Ocean, it is best to check the position of the ice cap, since the noise of navigating through the ice can be irritating to sensitive people.
The tourist attractions of Saint Petersburg include time in the city, and passengers on cruise ships are exempt from the visa requirement (please read the conditions).
Gambling establishments usually make a great effort to get visitors to spend as much time and money as possible.
Special food, drink, and entertainment are usually provided to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them occupied.
Some places offer free alcohol, the amount is a matter of judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being thorough.
Anyone who drives at high altitudes over sea level or over mountain slopes is likely to encounter heavy snow, frost, and cold along the way.
On icy and narrow roads, the noise is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on a bearskin rug.
In a blizzard, the snowfall can be so heavy that a person can get stuck in the fog.
Shade may also be limited by snowfall or ice on car wheels.
The icy and narrow roofs are again the norm in many countries, and traffic is largely unobstructed year-round.
The safari is perhaps the main attraction for tourists in Africa and the highlight of the trip for many visitors.
The term safari is generally used to refer to a journey overland to observe the magical African wildlife, especially on the grasslands.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment makes them easier to observe.
Lions, tigers, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they are better seen through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "forest safari", "walking safari", or "walking") involves a walk that can take anywhere from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events being held at other venues across Japan.
Since Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, it will be the only Asian city to have hosted the games twice.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but as of March, most coronavirus cancellations will not be in place until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to begin.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer a washing machine and a coffee table, even when you are not in your room.
Try using a hair blower if it is affordable, if you do not have a razor, or if you do not want to walk around in razor-sharp socks.
Make sure that the clothes do not overheat (which can cause them to shrink or even sag).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against certain threats.
In some places, a minute's boiling is enough; in others, it takes longer.
Soaps are bad, and if you are worried, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter species unknown to them in their home countries.
Insects can spoil food, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or cause infection.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans, are not generally classified as plagues.
Duty-free shops are places where goods can be bought free of duty and taxes.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most dangerous part of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through remote logging towns.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: Such roads are marked by steep inclines, narrow paths, and steep curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those on the front and rear axles - usually 35 to 40 miles per hour [56 to 64 km/ hr] - and strict adherence to them is even more important than not.
Interestingly, though, cell phone service is considerably stronger here than at other long-distance corners of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweetbreads are quite good and Bavarian, rich and varied, not unlike those of its neighbour to the south, Austria.
Fruit orchards are common, and apples are harvested year-round, with cherries and plums added over the summer.
Many German pastries also include nuts, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want to try a small but tasty pastry, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish that is made primarily from spices and seasonings along with meat or vegetables.
Curry is either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of water.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curries, whereas coconut milk is commonly used in southern India and other areas along the coast of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands, the term Indonesian cuisine is used to describe a wide variety of local dishes throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term refers to food that can be traced to central and eastern Java.
Javanese dishes are now widely served throughout the island, offering a variety of simple and tasty dishes, with Javanese flavor dominating the dishes, including peanuts, fire peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The legs of the legs are supported by legs that hang from either side of the heel.
They provide greater stability for the foot, but may be a safety feature because of the possibility of the foot becoming entangled in them.
If a horse falls from behind with one foot stuck in the stirrup, the horse may pull it back if it runs away.
For one thing, most riders wear boots with heels and a smooth, rather soft, sole.
Second, some horses, especially English horses, have safety harnesses that allow the rider to remove the reins from the hoof when the reins are pulled back.
Cochamo Valley - The highest cliff site in Chile, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks offer spectacular views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes within its endless walls.
Competitive downhill skiing, including cross-country skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing down a narrow snow-covered landscape on skis or snowboards attached to feet.
Skiing trips are very popular with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski vacations", and holidays are organized around skiing in certain places.
The idea of skiing is very old, with cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC.
The well that the dam supports dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first 24-hour water-skiing club was established by the Norsemen in Australia.
Skiing: Also called cross-country skiing, skiing, or simply skiing.
This is due to skiing, but does not usually include alpine or mountain climbing, but the latter sports take place in high slopes and require the use of much stiffer skis and ski boots.
Think of a ski trail as a path.
When conditions are good, you can cover a greater distance than if you were to walk, but you will rarely reach the speed of a cross-country skier without the weight of a backpack in your ski bag.
Europe is a continent of relatively small size but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travel between many countries would involve many visits and visa checks.
The Schengen area functions in this respect almost like a single country.
If you stay in this area, you can cross the border without going through the passport control again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen passport, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are, and some tax authorities classify goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition is geographically disparate, as age limits may be lower in some places, such as North America, compared to Europe.
