Not only does this support the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that you wouldn't normally get from fossil studies, such as color and the three-dimensional spatial arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say the animal's feathers were brownish-brown on top and pale to reddish-yellow on the underside.
This discovery provides a new window into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs lack the well-developed stem of a rhinoceros, but have the other feather features of a mustache and a beard, the researchers concluded that the rhinoceros was likely a late evolutionary change compared to other features.
Judging from the structure of the feathers, it was probably not used for flight, but rather to maintain its temperature or attract attention, and the researchers assumed that even though it was a juvenile tail, the feathers in the specimen were not the plumage of a juvenile, but the adult plumage.
The researchers assume that while this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern shows the adult animal's plumage rather than the plumage of a baby bird.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech process, with voters closing in to take a pre-printed piece of paper with the name of the candidate on it and put it in an envelope.
After the voter is identified by the officials, the latter puts the envelope in the ballot box and puts his signature on the voter list.
The whole procedure is carried out in strict accordance with French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there were no envelopes in the boxes at the time of the start of voting and that no other envelopes (except those dropped into the boxes by duly authorized and registered voters) were dropped.
To witness every step of the process, candidates can follow their representatives, and in the evenings, following a strict voting process, volunteers count the votes.

Price and Hyeon are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Kadebeck, 21, were killed in the crash, with Kadebeck behind the wheel.
Christopher Schneider would need plastic surgery on his face, and Edgar Vegelo was injured in his jaw and arm.
When Wook put a gun to the fifth soldier's head, it didn't work, and Schneider now suffers from constant pain and is blind in one eye, missing part of his skull, and his face is now partly made of titanium.
Schneider was giving video testimony from a U.S. Navy base in his own country.
In addition to Wednesday's competition, Carpaneda took part in two more individual races.
She first participated in the slalom, where she retired from the distance in the first race. 36 of the 116 participants of the competition showed the same result.
In the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in a sitting position with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first place finish by Austrian Claudia Löss and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth place finish by Jongi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers from the group of athletes with disabilities did not reach the finish, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to qualify for the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to the owner by the Madhya Pradesh State Police.
"We have arrested five people for raping a Swiss tourist and we were able to recover her mobile phone and laptop", said DK Arya, Deputy Inspector General.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar  are the names of those who are named as the accused.
The accused appeared in court with their faces covered, as reported by Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Salanki.
Even though there were three people in the car when it hit the house, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
While emergency services were freeing the driver of a red Audi TT, traffic on the road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked.
He was first admitted to James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was eventually transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
O'Deacoy has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is awaiting arraignment and trial while in custody, but given that her photographs have been widely published, any eyewitness testimony could be called into question.
Elsewhere in the UK this is common practice, however in Scotland the justice system works differently  the courts believe that the publication of the photographs could potentially be harmful.
"Journalists seem to be taking a dangerous path when they publish photos etc. of suspects", remarks Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Chancellery of the High Court, authorized to prosecute, informed journalists that at least until the indictment is presented, no further comment will be possible.
According to the information obtained, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in order to preserve the borders that existed before the start of the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the information received, among other topics covered by the document  are the issues of the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both peoples, as well as the problem of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands that after the signing of the agreement, the military presence in the valley be maintained for ten years, while Palestine agrees for five years only.
The shooters who were in the supplemental control program were closely monitored by rangers because the program was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service in conjunction with the Sport Shooting Association of Australia, Inc. recruited qualified volunteers to participate in the shooting program, which is implemented under the auspices of the Sport Shooting Association.
Mick Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service's park conservation and heritage, said the four shooters selected for the first shoot-out had been given comprehensive safety training and had undergone training.
Martelli yesterday swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council.
This is the fifth election to the Martelly Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
A presidential commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the election's provisional council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
To the large anti-regime protests that began in October, Martelli responded with a commission.
The reason for the protests, which were sometimes violent and violent, was the lack of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
There were about 60 reported cases of overheating of the defective iPods, resulting in six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
According to a statement from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEIT), the 27 accidents that occurred as a result of the use of the devices had information.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it had received reports from Apple of 34 new cases of overheating, which the company defined as "not serious".
In response, the ministry called the company's postponement of the report "worth deep regret".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday's time was 9:19 p.m. in Greenwich).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Authority said there were no reports of destruction or accidents in the country.
Furthermore, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has seized a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at this time at least six have been confirmed killed.
The six hostages, including the elderly and children as well as the photographers from the Philippines, were released early.
The elderly lady needed to go to the bathroom, so the photographers were taken hostage for her, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he began to study premature births in his spare time.
According to his research, the introduction of the hormone accelerated the maturation of the embryo's lungs.
According to the Xinhua News Agency, government investigators on Wednesday found two so-called "black boxes" of flight data recorders.
Luna's memory was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. She died in the night two months later. It's quite original, like her. Luna was a strong woman", said Tony Dreamer.
Dustin Goldstein Runnels said, "That Luna was still a freak, just like me... maybe even more... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I want to believe she's in a better place now".
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, the acting Prime Minister, stated that she believed that at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, Australia should become a republic.
Thirty-four percent of those polled said they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The most radical views were held by 29 percent who said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent who said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and take part in three relay events during the Commonwealth Games, but his physical form is questionable: he has complained quite a lot about his health.
He was not allowed to take painkillers because they are not allowed at the Games.
On January 25, mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri found the largest prime number known to date.
This discovery was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
It is thought that comets may have brought organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life, as well as water.
Given the history of cometary collisions in the distant past, scientists hope to understand how planets, and Earth in particular, formed.
Earlier this year, 53-year-old Cuomo was elected governor and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political gibberish and stupidity".
He is rumored to be running for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration says that with the NextGen system, planes will be able to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, unlike older ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to determine the location of aircraft with greater accuracy and to give pilots more accurate information.
The amount of traffic is not increased, and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, besides, there is no car park at ground level, as well as a catchment car park.
The likelihood of having to play behind closed doors without fans of the team was increasing, as it may well be that there are not enough vehicles.
The formation of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands is described in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
According to a report by researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of a new species took just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process would take much longer. The emergence of a new species was made possible by the crossing of the endemic ground yurk (Geospiza fortesza) with the non-indigenous cactus ground yurk (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be cast into many shapes, and it can be rolled into thin sheets.
You can pull it out into a very thin wire that you can easily twist and braid, or you can also chop it open and roll it into sheets.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it could be so thin that it was occasionally used to decorate illustrated books, so-called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a particular chemical, and you can actually make this acid-base indicator with your own hands from the juice of red cabbage.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of a particular substance.
The pH level of a test chemical is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (LH H in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as we know, a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Stir these two dry powders in a circle until they are joined into one, and then with your wet hands, make a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, and it creates this weird feeling, and it creates a shell.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mahendra had a flushing toilet connected to an elaborate sewer system.
In houses of Greek cities in Crete and Santorini, remains of sewerage systems have been found dating back to the Minoan period.
The use of unitas was also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman Empire, unitas were sometimes used in public baths, where men and women were kept together.
You're using a satellite to call someone thousands of miles away.
In space, a satellite receives a call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
A rocket is used to launch a satellite, but scientists have to use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere can refract light and distort the image.
To launch a telescope or a satellite into space, you need a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways, moving faster and easier -- that's the greatest thing the wheel has done for us.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
Below that are the medium-sized cats, and their prey is also medium-sized -- they hunt both rabbits and antelope and deer.
In addition to all this, many small cats (including domestic pets in the wild) catch and eat more numerous small prey  insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is that each cat has a niche, meaning that it has a unique function that it doesn't have to compete with other cats.
Lions are among the most sociable of all cats, living in large herds known as pride.
A pride may include up to three adult males who are related, and up to thirty females and young.
In most cases, the females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion parrots and wolf or dog packs are similar in many ways, with the latter often resembling lions (but not other big cats) in that they pose a mortal danger to prey.
The tiger can climb (but not as well), jump long distances, swim, and pull with five times the strength of a human, like a well-trained athlete.
The tiger is in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (the panther family). No other feline, except these four, can roar.
A tiger's roar is more like a sentence consisting of sharp and loud words than a lion's full-throated roar.
The animal is eaten by small animals, and when it can, it hunts monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds, all of which are much smaller than the animal.
Scientists believe that the acelots track and find prey by sniffing the ground.
Their night vision gives them excellent vision in the dark, which helps them navigate confidently, and they hunt for acelots, blending into their environment and attacking their prey from hiding places.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they originated (say, by moving across a river or a mountain range or when such organisms migrate to a new island, so that it is quite difficult for them to return), they often end up in an environment that is significantly different from the place from which they came.
And in this new environment, they have different resources and different competitors, so to compete effectively, the new population will need different traits or abilities than they had before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and they still need to adapt.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, the animals become less and less like the main population from which they separated.
It will take thousands or even millions of years, and sooner or later, the two populations will look so different that no one will ever classify them as the same species.
This process we call speciation, which actually means the creation of new species, is an inevitable result and a very important step in evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that we breathe, and they use the carbon dioxide that we exhale.
Plants cook their food from sunlight through photosynthesis, but they also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothing from plants, and we eat mostly plants, and animals couldn't survive without plants either.
Masosaurs were super-predators for their time, so they were afraid of nothing and no one except other masosaurs.
It had over 70 razor-sharp teeth on its long jaws, and an extra row at the top of its mouth, meaning that its prey was unlikely to escape.
The dinosaur's diet consisted of large fish, turtles, and other animals, and it is likely that they also ate members of their own species.
And he would attack anything that came into the water, even a giant like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
While their food might not have been much of a surprise, some of their meals were unusual to say the least, including wild game, gulls, snails, and one of the rodents known as the peanut butterfly.
Another distinction was that while the poor and women ate sitting on the benches, the rich had banquets where they ate and slept at the same time.
The dishes of ancient Rome could not include foods that would later be imported from the Americas or Asia.
They didn't have potatoes, or tomatoes, or corn, or cocoa, and no Roman ever had a chance to eat a turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians had a main temple that was considered their home.
Worshippers offered sacrifices to their deities, and priests attempted to satisfy their needs by holding various festivals and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had its own open inner courtyard and sanctuary, which could only be visited by priests.
In some cases, the temples were built with towers that resembled pyramids, known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special lantern dedicated to the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, a house didn't mean much.
For the most part, Jewish family life was lived outdoors.
Women cooked outside, shops were just open shelves facing the street, houses were built of stone.
Canaan lacked large forests, so the wood was highly valued.
Greenland was not densely populated, and if the Norse sagas are to be believed, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while sailing west, he came across Greenland, which he called "the Green Land".
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, despite each of these countries being "Scandinavian".
If you've seen the movie Treasure Island, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
But it's not true, because even though there's something written on the back of this document, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, reads: "The original version of the Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The reverse is at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but what is known is that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was originally folded for preservation.
So it's quite possible that this entry was added there just as a memento.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Operation Dragoon began as the Allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the Free French forces liberated the southern French territories in just two weeks, then moved toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people working together and living in a society.
The term civilization comes from the Latin civilis, i.e., "citizen", which is similar in meaning to the Latin civis, "citizen", and civitas, "city" or "city-state", which all speak to the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, the uniform distribution and the sustainable cultural footprint.
Often, small cultures are not considered civilizations in the true sense of the word, as they disappear without leaving behind any meaningful historical evidence.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the terms of the Thirteen States Confederation Treaty, with only Congress as a government.
Congress had no power to tax, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on government agencies, often not cooperative, to enforce all laws.
Furthermore, it lacked the authority to override state-imposed tax laws and tariffs.
According to the Articles of Confederation, any amendment required the unanimous consent of the states, and the states took the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, like the German national team, is ranked second among the strongest national teams in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing are some of the popular sports here.
The most popular winter sports are in the northern regions, with Italians also taking part in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is the island of Honshu. This makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms, as it is a cluster or group of islands.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when its name was recorded by passing European sailors as Farmosa  meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of the primitive bakery practices, hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized the western and northern Taiwan in 1683 and made Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which granted Japan sovereignty over the island, and the latter ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main sites: Incihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
To give visitors a better idea of how most of the buildings along the edges of the complex originally looked, the edges have been rebuilt.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
The most popular still-film format in the world is the 35 mm format, which was the dominant film format during the analogue era.
This film is still being made today, but more importantly, the height-to-width ratio of this film is now used in the matrix formats of digital cameras.
This may be a little confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Accordingly, the aspect ratio for this format (after division by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of integers) is believed to be  3:2.
Many common formats have the same or similar aspect ratios (for example, the APS family of formats).
The rule of thirds, often attacked and ridiculed, is a simple rule that provides dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
If he is to be believed, the best place for the placement of the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photograph into vertical and horizontal planes on the third (see example).
This period of European history brought the Catholic Church's rise to wealth and power into the spotlight.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that had occurred, Christianity united European countries for over a thousand years.
All  from the king to the common man  were under her all-pervading authority.
The essence of one of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and alleviate suffering, and that is what the church's money is there for.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this doctrine has been upheld.
Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
Embargoes on vital military and civilian goods, though in violation of generally accepted international law, have been legislated into law by several international agreements over the past two centuries, and have proven to be an effective strategy.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering certain areas of the ocean, exposing even neutral shipping to danger.
As there was no significant reaction to this tactic, Germany believed that it would not be used for unlimited underwater military operations either.
Among most citizens and countries during the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
States and peoples were intent on avoiding a repetition of the horrors and atrocities of World War I.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
A 4-cent bill, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Bachlar (his former manager) were in his pocket when he arrived in the United States.
Ancient China had unique ways of marking the different eras, and each period of Chinese history or ruling family had its own distinct dynasty.
In addition, the dynastic periods were separated by periods of united provinces and periods of instability, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
Throughout these periods, many rival nobles fought ruthlessly among themselves.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient China was the Three Kingdoms era: thousands of people died fighting for the top spot in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences, including the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the rise of nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged not to a single ruler but to the people.
In addition, the post-Revolution positions were opened to all male candidates, pushing the more successful and ambitious ones to the top.
In the army, the same thing happened, because if previously the military ranks were assigned based on the class, now they are based on skills.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that went beyond the mundane, and he often visited the Nur (lit. "light") cave on Mount Hira, known as the Hira, to meditate and reflect.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, provides a very vivid insight into Mohammed's spiritual background.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world  it is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it's very, very hard to find, even if anyone knows about it, because inside a cave, you're completely isolated.
There's nothing to see but the clear beautiful skies above and the many surrounding mountains, and there's very little of this world you can see or hear from a cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World to have survived to the present day.
The Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids built to commemorate the late pharaoh, and was built in the third century BC.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Necropolis of Giza, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were dedicated to the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The symbol for the upward bow looks like V, and the downward  looks like a bracket or square without a lower edge.
Upward bow means you start the movement from the end of the bow and go up, and Downward bow means you start from the peg (this is where your hand holds the bow) and go down.
Moving the bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while the downward  is a stronger and more confident one.
You can put your own pencil marks there, but remember that the arrow symbols are there for a specific musical purpose, and they usually need to be stored.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market had frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse), and Madame Elisabeth, the king's sister, into returning from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family were driven to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of whistling, wailing, and threatening people on the way to the king and queen.
The King and Queen had to open the windows of the coach under the pressure of the crowd of people.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved to the queen, who had already been scared to death, the head of the guard who had been murdered at Versailles.
The military costs of the US imperialists incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a significant part of the cost and interest on the bonds that were placed through the Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the US imperialists would be the surplus profits brought by the continued exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the preconditions for their formation.
The era in which these events occurred is traditionally called the Classical Middle Ages  a period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 CE).
The Early Middle Ages followed, followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages, the latter generally considered to have ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" is understood to encompass a range of practical ideas, from the push to advance a particular technology or technical necessity to the clear understanding that human destiny is determined by the logic on which scientific laws are based and their embodiment in the field of technology.
Two general ideas are common to most explanations of technological determinism: that technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn exerts a specific (rather than socially determined) influence on society.
In particular, there's a belief that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
However, if the number of cars is too small, a nationwide highway network is not economically viable, and new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
So, more people owning cars, that's why we have more accidents, and that's why we have new health care that allows us to treat all kinds of injuries.
A large element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was typical of Romanticism.
When we talk about the Romantic era, people were very much influenced by the geography of being present, and as time went on, they developed a culture and a tradition that was better than arbitrary laws, because it was in harmony with the place and the position of the community.
While Paris is considered the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe during feudal times.
Around 400 AD, the city gains prominence as an epicenter of luxury and retains this status almost until 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status as a capital of luxury waned, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts that included spices and silk, valued much higher than those offered in Byzantine markets.
It was then that Constantinople ceded the title of fashion capital to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries, and also in the 14th century.
The first strong influence on the style of clothing was the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years late because of the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style of knotting in the late Middle Ages, and the Crusades' invention of knotting clothing was one of the major events of the time.
In natural farming, the amount of food produced is sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is a simple and generally organic system that uses a region's unique ecological preservation of seeds, combined with re-seeding or other simple methods, all with the goal of maximizing yields.
Many farmers have historically used natural farming, and many developing countries still practice it today.
Subcultures are a place that brings together like-minded people who feel excluded by social norms, and allows them to develop a sense of self.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a particular subculture may be based on various factors  linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination thereof.
Members of a subculture often identify themselves as belonging to it through distinctive and symbolic styles of dress, behavior, and jargon.
The most common example of what socialization is and how important it is is when it comes to children who were unlucky enough to grow up in a environment of neglect, abuse, abuse, or humiliation, and who were not socialized by adults as children.
Some "wild" children have been held in captivity for long periods of time (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the lack of parental care has resulted from a parent's unwillingness to notice serious physical or intellectual disabilities and shortcomings in the child.
Before they were abandoned or escaped, the children were at risk of severe abuse or trauma.
Others were supposedly raised animals; rumored some lived alone in the wild.
If a child is raised entirely by animals, his or her behavior in almost everything (including physical limitations) reflects the behavior of the animal-caregiver: for example, such a child may be afraid of people or be indifferent to them.
So while the whole point of design-led learning is to make learning fun and easy, scaffolding goes even further.
I see scaffolding not as a learning method, but rather as a facilitator that helps people to take new learning experiences, whether that means using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual, like a teacher and a little plug-in in Microsoft Office.
The software that's built into these virtual assistants is to ask questions, give clues, and explain procedures that the student or the listener might not be able to figure out on their own.
There are many reasons why children end up in foster care, from abuse, neglect, to coercion.
You can't let children grow up in a world where they're not cared for, they're not nurtured, they're not educated, and yet this happens.
And we believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for foster children.
The assumption of our foster care system is that foster children will have access to good health care, safe homes, loving and caring caregivers and a stable education.
It is the belief that the foster family should provide for the needs of the child that were not met in the foster home.
The Internet is not just a means of mass communication, but also of interpersonal communication.
The peculiar nature of the Internet brings about additional possibilities for its use and to cater to the needs of an audience.
For example, it is suggested that concepts such as education and socialization are important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified by Aimee and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when studying audience reaction to Internet sites.
Video has provided important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions  denoting facial muscle movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
It's even claimed that correctly interpreting a microexpression can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his book "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks noted how images that people with brain damage can't understand, can still accurately appreciate sincerity.
He even suggests that animals -- like domestic dogs -- may also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
20th-century research suggests that there are two main sources of genetic variability, namely, overt and latent variation.
Mutations produce new genetic variations that are then removed by selection from the existing pool.
With each successive generation, segregation and recombination intersperse variations within these two pools.
The available plant resources in the savannah do not meet the amino acid needs of primates with a human-like digestive system.
And when they fail to do so, the consequences are serious, from malnutrition to stunted growth to inevitable death.
The most accessible plant resource is protein, which is found in legumes and leaves, but if it's not cooked properly, it's hard for primates like us to get enough of it.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, and egg) provide the body with a large amount of protein, rich in all the necessary amino acids, and are easily digestible.
With all of this in mind, it shouldn't be surprising to find that our ancestors were solving their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the deliberate awakening of a sleeping person during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
One way to do this is to use a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up, but not quite.
If you find yourself fiddling with the clock in your sleep, try putting it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other variants based on biorhythms, before going to bed, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluids (primarily water or tea, a well-known diuretic)  this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the tension of his body and spirit.
The lower the stress, the more positive the vitality is. Absolute peace and contentment are available to everyone.
Enlightenment is available to everyone, and the only thing that stops you from enlightenment is your own negativity and tension.
At the core of Tibetan Buddhism lies the teachings of the Buddha, which have been supplemented by the love path of Mahayana and a number of techniques from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's a combination of meditation, Kundalini yoga and loving humanity.
Kundalini yoga followers claim that to awaken Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment), one must practice certain yoga poses, mantras, and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a central part of Tibetan meditation practice, where visualizing various gods helps to clear energy channels, open chakras, and achieve enlightened awareness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to the Soviet Union and the United States becoming allies. After the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to quarrels between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins  former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it really involved friendly armies, with battlefields in different regions -- from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken by 17 September 1939. A retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
However, in just one night, these plans were foiled when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers as part of the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts entered the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Cargo shipping is arguably the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of a navy has been to ensure that their country is able to outnumber its people and its goods, and at the same time, the adversary is unable to outnumber its people and its goods.
One of the most significant examples of this idea was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the movement, using submarines as the main means of doing so.
Germany could probably have conquered Britain in the same way it had conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had failed.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them to ensure that milk, wool, meat and skins were available.
The goats were usually kept in herds, which roamed the hills or other pastures, and were often tended by the kazakas, children or adolescents who acted as shepherds.
As early as the 16th century, there were cobblestone roads in England.
Although the paved roads were mostly parallel wooden planks, they allowed the draft horses to move faster and pull heavier loads than the rough roads they had.
The spokes were used to hold the tracks in place early on, but it soon became clear that the tracks would be more efficient if they were covered with a railway track.
This practice became widespread, but due to the presence of iron, wooden wagon wheels were quickly worn out.
The first all-metal railway appeared in 1767, and the first all-metal railway was built in the 1760s.
The first known form of transportation was the walking stick, and about two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means "straight-walking man", humans started walking upright.
The Australopithecus, their predecessors, did not usually walk upright.
Straight-walking Australopithecus individuals have been found in rocks dating to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that seven million years ago, the sahelanthropus walked on two legs.
You can be more environmentally conscious, you can be part of the environmental movement, you can even be an activist so that in the future, these kinds of suffering are not a major problem.
Often, these look more like symptomatic treatments, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to find and address the root of the problem.
What's pretty obvious is that the world has changed dramatically because of the technological and scientific advances, and because of the overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyles of people, that's added to the problems.
After the July 4th Declaration was adopted by Congress, its handwritten copy, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as the Arkushi Dunlop.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9, and another arrived in London on August 10.
The first 25 printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as the Dunlap broadsides) have survived, although the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and may even still exist today, but we call them birds.
Because of their feathers and their ability to fly, many people don't consider them dinosaurs.
But birds still share many of the same features as dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, they lay eggs, and, like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, they walk on two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers are based on binary information.
Binary numbers can have any of the two values  0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs, and for example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, making it impossible to diagnose immediately.
The first sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of pills or toxic household chemicals.
The emergency medical instructions for this particular poison are to be found on the label.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term klop in the formal sense.
The term bed bugs comes from the fact that bed bugs have long been known to be highly adapted parasitic insects on humans.
Both kissing flies and bed bugs are nesting parasites that have adapted to living in nests or in the home of their host.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States alone, making it the most common neurological disease among young to middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child they already have.
They may give up their child for adoption.
Adoption is where the child's biological parents relinquish their parental rights to allow other spouses to raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works, and in fact, most scientific research is done using this method.
An experiment is a test that is performed to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and observing.
The classical texts received the most attention from philosophers and naturalists, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were generally accepted at the time.
As the number of Greek-speaking people decreased, the West found itself torn away from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many of the biorhythms we observe in animal behavior and physiology are heavily dependent on these endogenous cycles, which are regulated by the body's internal clock.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have been documented to have periodic rhythms that are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is a self-regulating process that, even when no external input is required, keeps going in independent cycles.
One of the main hypotheses that DNA is genetic material was confirmed by the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments where they either tagged the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or tagged the bacteriophage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material in which the mutation occurs, and whether the cells are affected by germline cells, mutations can have a wide variety of effects.
Only mutations in germ cells are inherited, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who have an interest in visiting different natural areas and territories, because they want to enjoy the general view and landscape, including, enjoy the observation of flora and fauna.
Examples of things to do in nature include fishing, hunting, bird watching, going to parks, and studying ecosystems.
For example, visiting, studying, and photographing orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People drive out of their cars from small provincial towns every morning to go to work, and other people drive by them, going to work in the same town they left.
In this dynamic transportation loop, everyone is involved in some way in and supporting the private car-based transportation system.
The scientific evidence suggests that today's high-carbon economy has disrupted the very biosphere that has largely contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
Transportation systems are used by all people who participate in society, and almost all of them are unhappy with transportation systems.
You don't hear so many complaints in developed countries about collapsing bridges or the quality of water.
Is it that transportation systems are such a constant source of complaints, that they break down so often, that transportation engineers are not as competent, or is there something more profound going on?
The concept of "transport movement" implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows presents a difficult problem because it's impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100 percent certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, tend to be pretty sequential people, so traffic flows tend to have some sort of rational sequence that can be approximated using mathematical models.
To more fully and qualitatively represent what vehicle movement is, it has been established how its three main parameters are related to each other: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections are essential to planning and designing road structures and to operating them.
The first animals to take to the air were insects, and their ability to fly enabled them to evade predators, find mates, and find food.
In most cases, the insects' wings fold along their bodies.
And this allows them to cram themselves into tiny spaces to hide from predators.
The ostrich and the one-day fly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
A man named Aristarchus, a few thousand years ago, argued that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many others held the opposite view - that the solar system (including the Sun and other stars) revolved around the Earth.
Sounds reasonable, because it's hard to see the Earth moving from the ground, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth, and the largest, with eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes six miles wide.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that enters the oceans from the world's rivers.
The Amazon River, which is fed by thousands of smaller rivers, is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.
Although the pyramid construction continued in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size and technical perfection.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments built by their ancestors, which were at that time over a thousand years old.
With only about 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world.
Italian is the language of Vatican City's legislation and official communications.
Most of those working in the public sector use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Because the basic chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) occur naturally in nature and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools, people have known about them since antiquity.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that all things consist of one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
Rather, it looked like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he theorized that these could transform into other substances and eventually become what we observe.
In most cases, an  alloy is a mixture of two or more metals, and the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
Also, some alloys have a small amount of non-metallic components, such as carbon.
Matter is the stuff of which everything in the universe is made, and all matter is made of tiny particles  atoms.
Atoms are so small that there are trillions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil's importance and frequency of use declined as new writing techniques were developed.
People are now typing messages on their computers, but no one needs a dishwasher.
We can only imagine what will happen to the keyboard when it is replaced by something completely new.
The plutonium bomb works by harnessing the energy of fusion, when a nucleus is formed with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a very heavy cart up a hill, and when the nucleus splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atomic nuclei are volatile, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no external influence.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side  about 100 km.
Under the lunar mares the lunar crust is thinner, and under the highland  thicker.
Lunar seas may be more on the nearer side of the moon, because the crust is thinner there, and, accordingly, the banks were easier to climb to the surface.
Theories of meaning are about what drives people or what attracts them.
The theories mentioned assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that they turn inward and to which they give a subjective character (in other words, internalize) during adulthood.
These theories all describe what makes certain people want to do what they do and what factors in their environment might influence whether they do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two authoritative, meaningful theories.
Essentially, there are two types of behavior that managers can have when they're taking on their former colleagues: At one end of the spectrum, they're trying to stay "their boyfriend" or "their girlfriend".
Managers of this type may have difficulty evaluating work performance, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, allocating responsibility, and holding accountable.
At the other extreme, the individual is so altered that they're unrecognizable -- they feel the need to override everything the team has done so far and take credit for it.
Ultimately, the responsibility for the success or failure of the team is the leader's.
This often leads to arguments between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that real teams have, virtual teams should have, but there are some slight differences.
Typically, virtual team members act as contact centers for the respective real-world group.
Given that such teams can meet outside of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be understandable to local leadership.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team  is the presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The management team that each member reports to is called the "invisible team", and it sets the standards for each member.
What is the reason why an organization might want to go through the long process of becoming a learning organization?
Creativity and ingenuity can come out in a way that the functional departments in an organization can use all the available resources efficiently.
So the process that an organization uses, where people work together to overcome a hurdle, can lead to a new innovative process that meets a customer need.
What they need to do is create a culture that encourages innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning, because that's when an organization can truly be called innovative.
In Engel (2006), the continental approach is a method by which organizations can achieve greater efficiency.
So the theoretical approach to cognition is backed by physical evidence in the form of neuroscience data, narrowing the field to a more specific and more specific area.
Researchers have received a number of studies that support the strong correlation between brain pathologies and behavior.
It's been known for a long time that various types of traumatic brain injuries, concussions, abnormalities, plaques, pathological changes and tumors in the brain affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
New technologies are making it possible to study the brain's structure and processes that we didn't know about before.
But what this does is it gives us this huge amount of data and information to build simulation models, which in turn helps us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
While the term "artificial intelligence" is commonly associated with science fiction, AI is actually a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligence of computers.
AI research involves trying to get machines to automate tasks that are necessary to make machines behave intelligently.
Examples include scheduling and control, the ability to respond to customer requests and technical problems, and the ability to recognize faces, voices, and handwriting.
They have their own separate disciplines, disciplines that take real-life problems and develop solutions to them.
Today, AI has many applications in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is also used as a software component in some computer programs and video games.
Excursions are a big part of school learning, and oftentimes teachers take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Using technology, students can take virtual tours of a museum, visit an aquarium, or even admire the beauty of artwork, all without leaving the classroom.
Taking virtual tours together is also a great way to think about your trip and share these lessons for future classes.
The students at Bennett High School in North Carolina, for example, design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year they re-design the website, but the old version is still online in an album.
In addition, blogging can improve students' written language, and while their grammar and spelling may be "squashed" when they start blogging, this usually turns out to be for the better, thanks to having an audience.
Given that students are usually the most fastidious audience, to avoid criticism, the blogger does everything possible to improve his style.
In addition, blogging "helps students better understand the world around them" and the need to keep the audience curious inspires them and forces them to remain competent and curious (Tota, 2004).
Blogging promotes collaboration and gives students a motivation to learn much more than the traditional school approach.
If learners use blogs properly, they can develop analytical and critical thinking skills; active response to Internet materials helps students to shape their own position towards what is written by other people, as well as to express their own views on individual problems (Orowiec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating and bilingual capital city, with numerous art galleries and museums that offer a glimpse into the country's past and present.
The Niagara Falls lie further south, and to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its unspoiled natural beauty.
For this reason, and many others, Ontario is considered a Canadian province by tourists, visitors, and other outsiders.
Large parts of its territory further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost completely deserted.
And the demographic comparison, which surprises many, is that there are more African Americans in the United States than in Canada as a whole.
The East African Islands are a group of islands off the east coast of Africa, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is arguably the largest of the three, and when it comes to wildlife, it's like a continent.
Almost all of the smaller islands are either independent states or are part of France, and are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
By the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, the beginnings of European influence and colonialism were established.
The northern boundary of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western boundary is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female tourists are always advised to say they are married, even if they are not.
Also, it may be helpful to wear a ring (one that does not look too expensive).
Women need to understand that because of cultural differences, they may encounter behaviors that they think are harassing, such as local men who may harass tourists, hold hands, and so on.
Say no to men and speak up for yourself (which is totally unacceptable, despite cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meronids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it as Casa Branca (White House) after the 1755 earthquake, but abandoned it.
The Moroccan sultan restored the city and renamed it Dar el-Baja, the name Casablanca derived from the Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the Old City of Medina, one can quite quickly find places where traditional Moroccan products  leather goods, pottery, tajines, beads and various toys are traded, however, all of them are intended exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda, popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma was hit by the eruption of the Niiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, mainly in the downtown area.
Although the city of Goma itself is safe enough to leave, it is worth doing a little research to find out if there are any fighting in the province of North Kivu at any given moment.
The city also serves as a base for the climbing of the Niirongorongo volcano, and offers very cheap services for mountain gorilla observation - more attractive prices in Africa are hard to find.
To get around Goma, you can take a Bodo-Bodo (a motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of Timbuktu's comparative inaccessibility, its name has come to be used as a metaphor for distant exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport, Timbuktu is today a city of the poor.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sands, it was inscribed on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
Henry Louis Gates gave much attention to the city in his PBS program "The Miracles of Africa".
Compared to the rest of the country, the city stands out even more because it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (NPC) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa. It is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe, and to the south by the Krokodil River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and contains 14 ecoregions, each of which is home to different animals and plants.
It is one of the country's most popular attractions and is considered the most significant of South Africa's national parks.
As with all national parks in South Africa, the park charges a daily entrance fee and an environmental fee.
In addition, it may be beneficial to purchase a so-called Wild Card  subscription, which entitles you to visit several parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
The name Hong Kong is borrowed from the island of Hong Kong, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
Hong Kong's beautiful buildings shaping its architectural face are often referred to as a glittering bar chart, and Victoria Harbour's waters are often used to highlight the city's presence.
The best views of Hong Kong are when you leave the island and head to the opposite coast of Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong's urban fabric is compactly distributed along the northern coastline in the arid lands.
In the past, this area was occupied by British colonialists, so if you want to see the evidence of the country's colonial past for yourself, this is where you should start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) off the coast of inland Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans National Park is a World Heritage Site designated by UNESCO as part of the Sundarbans National Park, which is located in the Indian state of Karnataka.
It's not just the mangrove swamps that are called forests, it's some of the last of the last of the dry jungles that once covered the Ganges Basin and are still standing.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which water bodies or swamps occupy about one-third.
The Sundarbans forest has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and currently, 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer are reported to be in the region.
From the inter-district bus station (located across the river) buses depart throughout the day, however, most depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakarta (located in the Boomtang district).
Due to the fact that inter-district buses are often crowded, tickets are recommended to be purchased a couple of days before the trip.
The Japanese-made Coaster buses are comfortable and reliable, and serve most areas.
A route taxi  is a comfortable and convenient way to get to places nearby,  for example, to the cities of Punakha (travel cost  200 nglt) and Paro (travel cost  150 nglt).
The bridge, which spans across Aiapok, is a freight bridge that connects the banks of the Aiapok River, which divides the two cities of Aiapok (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-Luailok (French Guiana).
The bridge is made of two piers, each 83 metres high, with a total length of 378 metres.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The bridge was opened to traffic only in March 2017, despite the fact that its construction was completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully functional in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaraní, who led the life of wolf-hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous people inhabiting the territory of modern-day Eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous groups, such as the Paihua and the Guaicuru, lived in the Chaco region, and they relied on hunting, fishing, and gathering for survival.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India", actually came into existence in the 16th century, when Spanish conquerors encountered the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a 300-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve its identity and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest polo tournament of the year takes place on the polo grounds in Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches are held here.
Information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be obtained from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is the same as the British Pound (GBP).
In the Falkland Islands, currency can be exchanged at the country's only bank, located in Port Stanley opposite the FISA West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted as payment anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are commonly accepted at Stanley itself.
The remote islands probably won't accept credit cards, but they might accept British or American cash, so ask the owners in advance what their payment method is.
It's virtually impossible to exchange the local currency outside the Falkland Islands, so do it before you go.
The reason is that while it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo, and vice versa, because it's south of the equator.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30°C in the summer months are common.
Winters there can be deceptively cold: the thermometer bar rarely drops below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes the temperature feel lower than it actually is.
The rainfall is almost constant throughout the year, so there are no specific rainy or dry seasons.
While many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people and don't need to be fed or disturbed, wild animals remain wild.
The park's management advises keeping away from bears and wolves at a distance of at least 100 yards (meters) and from other wild animals  25 yards (meters)!
Moose, elk, deer, bear, and almost any other large animal can go on the attack, no matter how obedient they may seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because of the lack of proper distancing, and you should avoid getting too close because these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous.
Bear and other wildlife are also attracted to their scents, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong scents and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city of just under 40,000 people is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia has been the capital of Samoa since 1850, and the country's official capital since 1959.
In 1889, the harbor was the site of a notorious naval confrontation when seven German, American, and British ships refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
The assassination of Tupou's supreme leader Thomas Lealphi III ended a peaceful rally in the city, held during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
Because of the harbor on either side of Auckland, there are a lot of beaches, and the most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches are located near North Harbor, and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south along the Pacific coast.
Most of the beaches are sandy, safe for swimming, and most have shade from half-dwarf trees.
The upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers (central Auckland) in the Waitematā Harbour are home to the beaches of Tamaki Drive.
It's another crowded family-friendly beach with lots of shops.
The main local beer is known to consumers as Number one, a simple but pleasant and refreshing drink.
While you can taste a variety of French wines, Australian and New Zealand wines are the best.
The local tap water is absolutely safe and drinkable, but if you have a few precautions, finding bottled water is not a problem.
Australians are not familiar with the concept of a "flat white" coffee, but espresso is a small black coffee, cappuccino is infused with cream rather than foam, and tea is brewed without milk.
The hot chocolate is exactly like the one in Belgium. Fruit juices cost quite a lot, but they taste great.
Reef trips are available all year round and in large numbers, but injuries and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
But we still want to listen to the advice of the authorities, follow all the requirements and follow the safety warnings very closely.
Cuban jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and near riverbeds north of the town of 1770.
There are sharks here, but they rarely attack people, and most shark attacks avoid people.
The crested crocodile is found primarily in the river mouths north of Rockhampton, not in the ocean.
Booking in advance relieves the traveler of anxiety because he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often deal with specific hotels, but you may be able to book through a travel agent other accommodation, such as camping.
Typically, travel agents offer packages of services that include breakfast, airport transfers to and from the airport, or even combined packages with airfare and hotel accommodation.
Also, if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain any other documents (such as a visa) that are necessary to reach your destination, the travel agent can hold your reservation.
It is recommended that you send your reservation suggestions or requests to the travel agent rather than directly to the hotel.
The vast majority of people who go to a music festival choose to stay, and most people feel that it's a hugely rewarding experience.
You'll have to come early if you want to find a camping spot next to the music place.
Remember, even if the main stage is closed, there may still be sections of the festival that are still playing at midnight.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
We recommend that you check your cabin location when crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter. The passage through the Ild can be accompanied by a terrible noise and crackling that is especially sensitive to people with sensory sensitivity.
The cruise program to St. Petersburg includes a leisurely time in the city, and passengers on these cruises do not need a visa (read the terms).
A typical casino is trying to make sure that you spend as much time and money as possible, and there are no windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
They usually have special deals on food and drinks and entertainment, all designed to keep guests in a good mood and not wanting to leave the casino.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are provided for a fee, but all the great players know the importance of sobriety, since intoxication interferes with clear thinking.
Snow, hail, and sub-zero temperatures are all factors that anyone planning to visit the northern latitudes or cross mountain passes should consider.

If the rider falls off the horse, his foot may get caught in the stirrup, in which case, if the horse is frightened and runs away, he may pull the rider along with him. To minimize the risk of this happening, some safety precautions can be taken.
First, special shoes with heels and a soft, rather narrow sole worn by most riders.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety arcs, so that if the rider pulls back the strap when falling, the safety arcs allow him to fall off the saddle.
