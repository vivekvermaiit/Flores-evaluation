This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
Scientists believe that the animal's coat was a brownish-brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other features of feathers - such as hooks.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or for appearance, and the researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this specimen shows mature feathers and not the plumage of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the plumage of an adult and not the plumage of a chick.

In France, voting has traditionally been done with little technology: voters go into a polling booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope with the candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter, after which the voter slips the envelope into the ballot box and then places his signature under the ballot paper.
The process is relatively narrowly defined in the electoral law of France.
Since 1988 ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that both voters and observers can see that at the beginning of the vote there are no envelopes in them and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, with volunteers counting the votes at night under strict supervision and following specific procedures.

Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for murdering her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the eyewitness account may be biased because her story has been widely published.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have ruled that the publication of photos could be detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos of alleged suspects.'
The Crown Office has overall charge of prosecutions and has told journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges are made.
Sources say the document refers to a settlement of the dispute, something the Palestinians wanted based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only prepared to be present for five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park preservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation had extensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is how Martelly has earned a CEP five times in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the former National Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to bring new elections to the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to widespread anti-government protests that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been due to take place since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company called "not serious".
"Very regrettable", was the ministry's response to Apple's delay in the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 0719 local time (Friday 2119 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Agency stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and at least six fatalities have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a physician.
Trained as a midwife, he began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins spent his spare time researching premature births.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, and Luna died on the night of the two moons, as unique as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was just as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
Resigning Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled supported this view, that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end 31 percent said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was called into question because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to ease his pain because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source that brought water to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially since comets have been colliding with the earth for a very long time.
Cuomo, 53, was sworn in as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and chatter".
There is speculation that he may run for president in 2016.
The NextGen system would allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, according to the FAA, saving millions of tons of fuel annually for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technologies with ground radars, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and they can provide pilots with clearer information.
There is no additional transport and no overhead trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the car parks and the P&R are not accessible on the premises.
A possible lack of transport made it more likely that the match would be played behind closed doors and without fans.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science looked at the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations, a process thought to take much longer because of the time it took to cross a native Darwin's finch, the Middle ground finch, with an immigrant Cactus ground finch, the Española ground finch.
Gold can be worked into many shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow thread that can be twisted and braided, or it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
After being made very thin, it could be pasted onto another metal, and it could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the carbon juice then changes according to the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands, and make a ball of it.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the towns of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Sewage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, there were toilets in ancient China, Egypt, and Persia, and in Roman times they were often part of a public bathhouse, where both ladies and gentlemen met in a mixed group.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it will be immediately returned.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and images.
To guide a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is over 100 feet [30 m] long.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is a much easier and faster way to get around.
The train, the automobile, and many other modes of transportation are the result of this.
There are medium-sized felines among those medium-sized prey eaters, from hares to antelopes to deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as free-roaming cats kept as pets) that hunt small prey in larger numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has that doesn't compete with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to 30 females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large felines), and that are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and have five times the traction power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar with full force like a lion, it's more like it's grunting a whole sentence.
The ocelot's favorite food is small animals, and it catches monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when it can, but it preys almost exclusively on animals much smaller than its own body.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing out the ground where they have been.
They have night vision, so they can see very well in the dark, and they move very inconspicuously, and they hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the large population from which they originated (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different enemies are available, so the new population must change its attitude or adapt to face the competition.
Because they still need the same adaptations as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation, and it simply involves the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Through photosynthesis, plants obtain nutrients from the sun and provide shade.
Our homes and our clothes are made of plants, and we eat plants, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at the time, and it had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasaurus.
His long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning that nothing or no one could escape him.
It's not certain, but it's possible that its tongue was forked, and it ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even its own kind.
Nothing in the water was safe from the attacks; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a sloth.
There was another difference, too: Poor people and women sat on chairs at the meal, but rich men liked to have a banquet together, where they reclined on their sides while eating.
Meals of Roman antiquity do not include foods that came to Europe in later centuries from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for all their gods, and this temple was seen as the home of that god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was reserved for priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
Houses were of little importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Daily life in the Hebrew family was often conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were little more than street counters; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated at the time, and according to Norse mythology, Erik the Red, banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west and named it after himself.
He made this discovery, but there were Eskimo tribes living there at the time.
Although all of them were 'Scandinavian' countries, the personalities, the royal family, customs, and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway were very different from one another.
You might think after watching the movie National Treasure that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's because there's a misunderstanding, because there's something written on the back, but it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the United States Declaration of Independence are the words "Original United States Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (about 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was formerly rolled up for storage.
It therefore appears that the indication was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, the north of France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France, and these were Frenchmen who had joined the Germans in 1940, and so they were siding with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks, and then they were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
City states are the precursors of nations, and a civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, and thus are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolution, thirteen states formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of a congress.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judicial branch and relied on state authorities for the execution of all decisions, which were often uncooperative.
Nor did it have the authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
First, all the states had to agree unanimously to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest island being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as a 'peninsula'
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when sailors from Europe passed by the island and named it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in southwestern Taiwan as a base, where the VOC took over the indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces, and Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Built of three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Arms.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they used to look like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the work is still going on.
For example, worldwide the most common still image format is 35 mm, which was the common film format in the later analogue film era.
These are still produced today, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the image sensor of the digital camera took over.
Strangely enough, 35mm film is actually 36mm wide, at a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would then be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-like formats) are identical to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also clear.
The most effective place to place the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, so you divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the commoner, his all-pervading power affected everyone.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has funds for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the church was the central authority in Rome, and this relationship of power and money caused many people to begin to question whether this principle was being followed.
Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to provide vital supplies to military and civilians, but this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which has been enshrined in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has laid mines in international waters, making entire stretches of the ocean impassable, even to neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestrained submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolationism.
After World War I, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
There was also an unstable period between the different dynasties, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time, fierce wars were fought between various nobles vying for the throne.
In ancient Chinese history, the Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest, with thousands of people dying in the battle for supremacy in the great palace of Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the view that the country belongs to its people rather than to a single leader.
All male applicants were eligible for posts after the revolution, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same goes for the military, where the ranks are no longer based on a person's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Muhammad was intensely concerned with supernatural matters, and he often went to a cave for meditation that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Nour.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave is located on a mountain top on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if the cave was known to exist, it was not easy to find, because once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
All that is visible is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and there is very little of this world to see or hear from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of the many great pyramidal structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'Pyramids of Giza' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a notch or a square with the bottom missing.
Top means you start at the tip and push the string away, bottom means you start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty of sketching your personal signs, but remember that the printed strings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a group of market women were behind the departure of the death-scared Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by howling and threatening mobs that threatened the royal couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in connection with the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance much of the cost, and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism was based in large part on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide assortment of ideas in practice: from technology offerings or technological imperatives to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: that the development of technology follows a trajectory that for the most part goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some may say that the advent of the automobile automatically leads to the building of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass car ownership is also causing more road accidents and this is leading to the development of new health care techniques to repair the human body.
Romanticism had a great deal of cultural determinism, which came from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual, and over time, geography gave rise to customs and cultures that created a harmonious society that was superior to arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the fashion capital today.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 A.D. to about 1100 A.D.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic celebrated its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, styles in the West lagged 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, a style of its own began to develop in Western Europe, and one of the major developments was the result of the Crusades, when people began to use knots to fasten their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses stored seed from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture may be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or any combination of these.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to by a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave, and in the jargon they speak.
One of the most widely used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization was the few deplorable cases of children who, through neglect, setbacks or willful abuse while growing up, were not socialized by adults.
Some wolf cubs have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents would not accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Unmanageable children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child not raised by humans may exhibit behavior similar to the behavior of the animal that cared for the child (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should make education simpler and more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, for example, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the Microsoft Office paper clipper.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids, and explains procedures that may be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are many reasons why children end up in foster care, including neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared for, and where they cannot develop, and yet this is happening.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The idea is that foster care provides a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
The Internet is merging elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'persistent relationships' when they studied audience responses on websites.
Using video recordings has led to remarkable breakthroughs in interpreting microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that no one can recognize a lie by looking at microexpressions alone.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, described how it is that people who cannot understand that speech because of brain damage can still accurately gauge its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also possess the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has revealed two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection eliminates this variation from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, the two groups are varied by separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can find it difficult to obtain the amino acids it needs from the plant sources found on the savannah.
Furthermore, failure to observe it can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and, eventually, even death.
The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they're cooked, they're difficult for primates like us to digest.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a very high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep disruption involves waking up for a reason during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is quite easy to do by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely right away.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can put this on the other side of the room, and this way you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), which may make you have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person has is in proportion to the amount of stress a person is carrying in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present, and every human being is capable of achieving contentment and total peace.
Anyone can lighten his or her mind, and the only thing that's gonna get in the way of that is your own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a pursuit of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is aroused.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus, using the visualization of various deities to cleanse energy channels, activate chakras, and bring the consciousness into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a cooperation was established between the USSR and the USA. When the war was over, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies were facing each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years, and proxy battles took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held out only until 17 September 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were however overturned overnight, when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Cargo transport by ship is the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the Navy's job is to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while the enemy's ability to transport people and goods is actually hindered.
The US was trying to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic to the British and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic with the help of mostly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen to Germany had the Allies failed.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran some 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always have easy access to hair, meat, milk and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other pasture, and were then guarded by goatherds, as the more familiar sheepherder was often a child or youngster.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn railways consisted of only a rails of planks, the horses had to run faster and faster and to pull larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult roads of the day.
Early on, crossbeams were used to hold rails in place, but gradually it was realized that rails would be more efficient if an iron tip was present on top.
This soon became the standard practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were laid.
The first form of transportation we know of is walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus appeared.
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, was less likely to walk upright.
And we find bipedal specialisations in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and we also find that Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement, or even take action to alleviate some future suffering.
In many cases it is like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we must identify the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have evidently changed the earth dramatically, and overpopulation and extravagant human life-styles have added to the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away, signed by Continental Congress President John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, these are now better known as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9, while another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Fragments are the oldest surviving copies of the document, the original handwritten copy having not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a dinosaur species alive today.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind us of a dinosaur.
They have claws and scales on their legs, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary numbers is the basis for almost all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific E.R.D. instructions for that exact poison.
This group of insects is formally called "bugs" by entomologists.
This term comes from an age-old resemblance to bed bugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
Both red and bed bugs are nest-bound, having adapted to live in the nest or the home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder in young to middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests, or that of their child.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the main goal of science, and this method is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just experiments; an experiment is a test to rule out, question, and observe one or more potential assumptions as a guideline for scientific research.
Physicists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
Physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms often have a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live by periodic rhythms, and these are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a certain period of time, even when no external signals are emitted.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important clues that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted: in one experiment, the DNA in the phage was labeled with radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the protein in the phage was labeled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary, while other mutations can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
The site offers opportunities for hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, parks, and study of the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small villages drive to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is in the village they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that this huge carbon economy is no longer keeping the biosphere in the stable state that allowed human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, water quality problems or collapsing bridges are comparatively rare.
Why do so many complaints arise about transport systems, why do they fail every day, are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow looks at the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow, because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a fairly predictable way, which means that traffic flows have some consistency and that there is something to be said about this in mathematical terms.
The three key characteristics are linked to better reflect traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape predators and to find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide in a greater number of small places from predators.
At present, only dragonflies and ladybugs cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, and so did the sun (and other stars).
This makes a lot of sense, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, stretching six miles in some places.
Some 20 percent of all the water that flows into the sea through the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The mainstream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and its water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populous.
Italian is the language of official communication and laws in Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used in religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, like gold, silver and copper, since ancient times, because they're all found in nature and it's fairly easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they go into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is simply a combination of at least a few metals, and as you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are included in the metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was first launched.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pen has been degraded and is used much less.
Today, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a dot-cutter.
You can wonder what's going to happen to the keyboard once something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they fall apart at the slightest.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock, and the crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more marinas on the side, because the crust is thinner there, and lava could have been more easily brought to the surface there.
Content theories are about finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories seek to explore the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's motivation-hygiene theory.
In general, two approaches emerge when managers take charge of their former colleagues: one approach is to try to position themselves as equals.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary action, conduct evaluation meetings, delegate and address people on their responsibility.
On the other end of the spectrum, he or she transforms into an unrecognizable individual, who feels compelled to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to take it all for himself.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Often this behavior leads to a rift between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, although there are some minor differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are often more self-reliant than traditional team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports, and the invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity are manifested when all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
To enable innovation in an organisation, management must foster a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with a continuum-based approach.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, allowing the field of research to be narrowed and more precise data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
As new technologies are developed, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes of the brain.
This gives us a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us a better understanding of the processes of our minds.
AI immediately strikes most people as science fiction, but it's also a core part of computer science, used in research on machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is a research field of AI.
Some examples are management, scheduling, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class, and often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Advances in technology have made it possible for students to take virtual field trips, allowing them to view artifacts in a museum, look inside an aquarium, or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year and previous versions of which are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills, often starting with poor grammar and spelling, but quickly changing as they gain an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging 'also forces students to learn more about the world around them' The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can 'help pupils develop analytical and critical thinking skills; by actively engaging in online discussion, pupils can find their own place in the context of other people's material, while also taking their own stand on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's bilingual capital is charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south, Niagara Falls, and further north, the beautiful, unspoilt Muskoka and beyond.
This is the kind of thing that makes Ontario, in the eyes of outsiders, typically Canadian.
Further north, large areas are fairly sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic comparison that may surprise many: There are more African Americans in the United States than in all of Canada.
The East African islands are located off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in terms of fauna it is almost a continent apart.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India, marking the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and on the north by the Sahel region.
Women: Female travelers are advised to state that they are married, whether or not this is true.
It also helps to wear rings (not too expensive-looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviour which they consider intimidating and that it is common to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to be your man (cultural differences don't speak for this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but after an earthquake in 1755 they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad, and the Spanish merchants who established their trading base here called it Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items such as tagines, pots, leather goods, water pipes and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located near Rwanda in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano, which spewed lava and submerged most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, before visiting outside Goma, check the state of affairs regarding the fighting going on in North Kivu province.
In addition, the city is the base for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano and is home to some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
A boda-boda (a motorized taxi) can get you around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
Timbuctoo is relatively inaccessible and is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a pauperized city, though its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport make it a popular destination.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to desert storms.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS exhibition Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the rest of the country because it has an Arab feel to it rather than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, along the border with Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Krokodil River.
The park covers 7,500 square miles (19,500 sq km), divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wildlife species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily maintenance fees and admission fees apply.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which offers access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The whole territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and many tourists consider it the most important place.
The sheer number of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a sparkling bar chart that is made visible by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
The majority of the people of Hong Kong Island live very closely together on land that has been mined along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the entire world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Indian and Bengali interior.
The Sundarbans are now officially a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part within India's borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are more than just mangrove swamps - they also boast some of the last mighty patches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is marshland and swampland.
The Sundarbans have been a game reserve since 1966, and the area is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (across the river), most departing between 6.30 and 7.30 am, mainly in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as the regional buses are often full.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis allow for quick and comfortable travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the building is 378 meters long and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
The bridge was completed in August 2011 but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs offices are expected to be ready for use.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group, living in what is now eastern Paraguay, as semi-nomadic hunters and also as subsistence farmers.
In the Chaco province lived other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly called 'the great province of India,' was founded in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous people.
A three-century period of Spanish colonization followed.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has preserved much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions are also held here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is approximately equal to one British Pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands, in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store, where you can exchange your money.
In general, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and American dollars.
On the outlying islands, you may not be able to pay by credit card, but you may be able to pay in British and American currency.
Change your money before you leave the islands, for Falklands currencies are very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it's summer there, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures in excess of 30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold, with temperatures that rarely go below freezing, but the wind combined with humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
Rainfall levels remain roughly constant throughout the year, with no recognizable "wet" and "dry" periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are wild after all, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
In the park, keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
Moose, bison, reindeer, bears, and just about any other large animal can attack you, no matter how tame they may appear.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, and the city of nearly 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor, a situation that came to be known as the infamous stalemate.
All ships were sunk except for one British battleship, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed in a violent nonviolent meeting in the city that got out of hand.
There are many beaches, mainly because of Auckland's two harbours, and the most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbour district stretch north to south along the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have pohutukawa trees to provide shade.
At Waitemata's harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you'll find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good supply of shops on the coast.
Number One is the main local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water is safe to drink, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A flat white is a strange concept for Australians, black coffee is espresso, cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian quality, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're great.
Trips to the reef take place all year round and injuries from these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town of 1770, and occasionally outside this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, and they don't normally live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other forms of accommodation, such as a camping spot, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes even flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer for a while or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you should do so through the travel agency rather than the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to be early to get a campsite near the music.
And remember this: Even after the music on the main stage has ended, other parts of the festival grounds may still be playing music late into the night.
For families with young children, some festivals have special camping areas.
Be careful where you put your cabin when you cross the Baltic in winter, because the ice-crossing creates a tremendous noise if you sit too close.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time to explore the city.
Casinos usually strive to make the most of the time and money spent by guests, and windows and clocks are usually not present, and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages, but when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
If you are going to go into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you should be aware that there may be snow or ice and that the temperature may be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and the driving is different from asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to become trapped.
Other obstacles to visibility may be falling or floating snow or the presence of condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many lands and do not hinder traffic.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa is safari, which for many visitors is the highlight of their trip.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to trips overland to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good views.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need binoculars, otherwise you're not likely to see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'running safari') involves walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry wet clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can often borrow these items even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you do not want to wear socks with irons, you can also use a hairdryer if available.
Make sure the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are a number of ways to purify water, some of which are effective in addressing specific risks.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in other areas, water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not all filters are equally effective, so if you have doubts, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not present in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill people, are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping means that you can buy goods in certain locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a considerable amount of money on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, and you often drive through abandoned backcountry terrain, which makes this one very challenging.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your head down, you'll come across many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp curves.
The posted maximum speeds are significantly lower than in previous and successive areas  usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is even more important to stick to them here than otherwise.
Surprisingly, you have a much greater range here than in other corners of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great, and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, as are the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit cakes, and all year round the cakes contain apples, and in the summer months, cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and they taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but powerful pastries, try some that are called in the Berliner region Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
To make a curry, you need spicy and spicy ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior of northern India and also Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine encompasses dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without further information, the term refers to the food originally from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago, offering a variety of simple spicy dishes. The most common Javanese seasonings are nuts, peppers, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant herbs.
Lifting braces support the rider's feet and hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but they can also cause safety problems by allowing a rider's feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety harnesses that allow a saddle's stirrup to be released when the saddle is pulled back because a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces that seem to have endless potential.
Descending winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 B.C.!
The beginnings of skiing date back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It's not quite the same, but it's like alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is often done on steep terrain, and you need a lot of tougher skis and boots for that.
You can think of the ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover greater distances than by walking, but it is rare to reach the speed of cross-country skiing on paved trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.
The Schengen area, however, functions in this area almost as one country.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a passport control again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique goods, and some tax offices define goods older than 100 years as antique.
The definition may vary by location, for example in North America the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to classify handicrafts as antiques, despite the fact that they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life for the Sámi, and the culture of trade is very important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they subsisted on fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Many Sámi people today work in modern occupations.
The word 'gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, but it is also often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are going to applies a travel advisory, this may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You can also consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is directed to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions provide only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often give a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic picture compared with other, more detailed sources.
Emergency weather is the general term for any dangerous weather event that may result in damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather events can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather events, which vary based on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The effects of severe weather include strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks posed by severe weather conditions in their area, as these can also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A search for "hostile environments course" on the Internet will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course normally covers all the issues discussed in this book in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, lots of EMTs and occasional weapons training.
While there are many books and magazines with articles on wilderness survival, there is little published about war zones.
Travellers who have planned a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for the return journey.
There is a wide variation in the willingness of governments to issue passports that do not include a gender (X), or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
In addition, security searches have become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can be assured that they will not go through this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Moose currents are the recurrent currents of waves that break on a reef or similar body of water and flow onto the beach.
Due to the underwater topology, the return current is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you've escaped the strong current, swimming back is a breeze.
Try to focus on a place where you won't be caught again, and depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might as well wait for help.
The return shock is worse than the culture shock (you have a less intense "honeymoon feeling"), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who readily adjust to new cultures may find it difficult to adjust to their own.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your own customs.
In the past, when you traveled abroad, you found that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
Patience and understanding are not usually expected of travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the neighborhood.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Often, the sound of vendors and tourists is always heard here, and the story of light and sound is like that of a book.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projections on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have been claimed by several countries since then.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception, where you'll find the full-fledged crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is on the southern side of the peninsula, bordering Bellingshaus Lake.
Here the mountains of the peninsula descend into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 200-mile-long (360 km) Mount Ellsworth range, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson being the highest at 4,892 metres (16,029 ft).
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no cell phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions requiring external data and communication.
Your local telephone provider can provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
It's becoming more popular for people who plan a gap year to travel and learn.
This is particularly the case for school leavers who take advantage of this to take a gap year before university without detrimental effects on their education.
Often, enrolling in a study abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees are payable for enrolment in these educational programmes.
Finland is a fantastic sailing destination, and the 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelago or the lakes.
The archipelagoes off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, but smaller boats or even a kayak give you a very different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their leisure time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is similar to that of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, and is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in 40).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
You can spend several full days in the historic site and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you go ashore only during a boat trip.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital, Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It is nothing to be ashamed of; it is no different from many fears that other people have.
Knowing how airplanes work can help to allay a fear that comes from the unknown or from not having control of the plane.
Courier companies are generously compensated for the speed of delivery of items, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for necessary repairs.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
When they send things by air, it can take days on some routes before they're unloaded and get through customs.
It was only as checked baggage that it could be processed more quickly, because according to airline regulations, there must be a passenger accompanying you, and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a bag of money for the privilege (or better yet, have your employer do it for you).
But this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times for economy class and about eleven times for first class.
It is usually not useful to look for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know all too well that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money to get somewhere fast and comfortable, and the airlines are charging corresponding fees.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, and the main language spoken is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
As a multiethnic republic, Moldova was beset by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by UN members.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the predominant religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul and a good traffic hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping malls covered with red tiles, the 18th century markets, the old mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditional Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a remarkable octagonal church.
Interesting marble sculptures of pigeons are found on a number of tombs near the church.
If you have half an hour, you should definitely look around this village.
To the north lies the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous to foreigners after Lord Byron spoke highly of its beautiful monuments.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop in Cabo da Roca.
Also head north and see the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally famous Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember that you are visiting not just a mass grave but also a place that has almost immeasurable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
Many of the men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many of them have loved ones who were murdered or who died there, both Jews and non-Jews.
During your visit, please show all appropriate respect, solemnity and dignity, and do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by marking or graffitiing the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
Yet, most signs are in Catalan, since that is the first official language by law.
Spanish is widely spoken in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned stops are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
Parisians are known to be selfish, rude and arrogant.
While this is usually just a false stereotype, it doesn't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-educated). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The hard exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their ways.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine trees, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the different soil types and the varying height differences.
This area is also home to a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the rooster are found here, along with all sorts of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt up to the knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually, a woman's scarf is given to you when you arrive at a monastery unprepared, but if you bring your own copy, with its bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile kindly at you.
On the other hand, men should wear pants to at least the knee.
You can also borrow them from the store at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed every time they are worn, so you may not feel comfortable with that.
Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (particularly pork) and makes heavy use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to connoisseurs, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, like Sie, which means you, always have a capital at the beginning, even if they're in the middle of the sentence.
In this way, you make a distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether to use a verb or an adjective as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so there are generally few problems with pronunciation.
You should pay the most attention to the c and the g. Their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Also, pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means "darling", while carro means "car".
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar will therefore teach you much about Persian grammar and help you to understand sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar to this that you don't need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete, serving as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution wasn't as big a problem then as it is now, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than they are today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms, and it's been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers, and that's where the concept came from.
Japan's first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor and were meant only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so you should resist the urge to remove even "just one" species.
If you collect samples while visiting a landscaped garden, you will be denied access to the garden immediately and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate, and almost everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics' but a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (less often when the sky is clear).
Also, some buses head north to Hebron, the surviving burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are taking actually enters Hebron and does not just travel to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
In addition, nonbelievers in Christian lands and non-Christians throughout the world have adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There's a tradition where you stay up all night at Easter until you can see the sunrise at a certain point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
In traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with congregations often celebrating a feast in honor of Christ's resurrection at the stroke of midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands have come here by swimming, flying or floating.
The long distance from the mainland prevented mammals from making the journey, making the giant tortoise the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos.
Since man first set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During winter, the Arctic and Antarctic regions experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you will be able to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be dark more or less day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem, which means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Suits are standard work clothes and colleagues call each other by last name or job title.
Consensus in the workplace is crucial, focusing on group performance rather than individual work performance.
Employees often need to get permission from their supervisors before they can make a decision and are expected to follow the instructions of the supervisors without thinking.
