An experimental vaccine appears to be available that could reduce Ebola mortality, but no suitable treatments have yet been found to treat the existing infection.
One combination of antibodies, ZMapp, was initially promising in this field, but official studies indicated that the benefit obtained from this combination was lower than the desired mortality benefit.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as the control standard, meaning that researchers set it as the reference and compared the other three treatments against it.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a common theory of evolution, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and 3-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a complete evolutionary skeleton, called a "spine", but instead have secondary feather characteristics - such as protuberances and microtubes - researchers have concluded that the spine was probably a later evolutionary development of these secondary characteristics.
The wing structure suggests they were not used in flight but only for thermoregulation or for display.The researchers suggest that although this specimen is of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage with no dorsal fin.
The researchers noted that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird feathers rather than feathers of a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning in a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty others.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made of the Milky Way.
The effect the team investigated is due to tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon's pull on Earth causes tides to form, the Milky Way galaxy attracts the Milky Way.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in much the same way as natural matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy lies in a halo-like environment, composed of large numbers of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: where voters isolate themselves in a booth, and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box, and signs it on the voter roll.
The French electoral code regulates the procedure unfavourably strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no conditions at the start of voting, and that no one is adding conditions other than those of registered and duly authorized voters and commissioners.
Candidates may send representatives to oversee every aspect of the process. In the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision following specific procedures.

The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambhu Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused stood before the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
But the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services released the driver of a red Audi TT.
He had previously been admitted to James Baggett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
She has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness could be called into question as his photograph was widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in Britain but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have recognised that the publication of the photographs could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems to me that journalists are certainly heading in a dangerous direction for publishing photographs or otherwise identifying the real suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service advised the press that there would be no further comment until at least after the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, refers to a border dispute, which Palestine disputes based on the pre-1967 war borders of the Middle East.
Other topics that were reported to have been covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is an important issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a ten-year military presence in the Golan, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a five-year one.
The guards had to supervise the shooters closely in the supplemental pest control experiment, because the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were selected under the Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick Auflin, acting director of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage, the four hunters selected for the first hunt have received extensive safety briefings and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday by a new provisional nine-member electoral council.
This is the fifth by-election for Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, have occurred over the failure to hold elections due by 2011.
About 60 incidents of iPod overheating malfunctions have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving hardware.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 incidents of malfunctions, which the company termed "not serious".
The Ministry responded to Apple's call for a delayed report as "deeply regrettable".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday 9:19 p.m. GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management stated that no damage had been reported in the area.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami wave.
A former Filipino policeman has taken two Hong Kong tourists hostage in a bus hijacking in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
He rescued many hostages and has confirmed at least six deaths so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly persons, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographer later replaced an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Leighens followed in his father's footsteps and made medicine his profession.
He trained as a gynaecologist and then went on to work at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Leggens began investigating preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His research has shown that when given a hormone it accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders or so-called "black boxes" on Wednesday.
I also admire my fellow wrestlers for their color.
"Luna was the first extreme queen", said Tommy Dreamer. "My first mistress, Luna, died on the night of the full moon. A strong woman, nothing like her".
Dustin " The Goldfinch " Runnels commented: "Luna was as eccentric as I am... probably more so than I am... I love her and I miss her... I wish she were in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the percentage opposing Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agreed with this view, and they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Conversely, in the survey, 29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The physical fitness of the Olympic gold medalist was called into question by his fatigue, as he was supposed to swim the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle and in three events at the Commonwealth Games.
He could not take the medication necessary to overcome the pain because the use of these medications is prohibited in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime ever discovered on January 25.
Several people made the discovery using various devices and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth as well as organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets, and especially the Earth, were formed when comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumours "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
Neoxygen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, which will save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-linked technology in contrast to older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of an aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
There is no additional public transport and the underground trains do not stop at Wembley, as well as car parks and parking facilities and a ground-floor elevator.
Concerns over lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although this process was believed to have taken much longer - due to cross-breeding between a resident Darwin's bat, a medium-sized ground vole, a migratory cactus vole, and a sharp-nosed ground vole.
Gold can be shaped into many shapes. It can also be rolled into small cubes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be rolled up and out. It can also be struck or rolled into paper.
It could be made very thin, glued onto another metal, and it could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "luminous manuscripts".
It is called the chemical's H-value, and you can make an index for that number using red clover juice.
The color of the cupping juice changes depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The level of hydrogen acids is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical that is being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Fold the two dry powders together and then mash them with clean wet hands until they are ball-shaped.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of covering.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had toilets with flush toilets in almost every house coupled with a sophisticated sanitation system.
Remains of sanitary sewer systems have been found in houses in Minoan Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would go together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and then returns it almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere obscures some of the light and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the face of the world dramatically; but it has also made the easiest and fastest transport possible for us.
We have the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
A rank below it has more medium-sized cats feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits, deer, and deer.
Finally, there are many small mammals (including stray domestic cats) that eat numerous smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of creatures and live in large groups called swarms.
A lion family consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closer together, so they have a larger family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly animals similar to lions (but not other large mammals) behave and are very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, leap long distances and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus) as the lion, the leopard, and the panther. These four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not the same as a lion's roar in full volume, but it is closer to an angry roar of words.
The pygmy leopard prefers to eat small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the pygmy leopard hunts are smaller in size.
Scientists believe that feral cats track and find prey by smell; they smell where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well with night vision, and while they move their tails, the pygmy leopards hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main group of population to which it belongs (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or are moved to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from the one they were in before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group will need different attributes or adaptive methods to become a stronger competitor than it was in the first place.
The Aboriginal people have not been changed at all, so they still need the same methods of adaptation as we have known them.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, their similarity to other populations gradually diminishes.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the appearance of the two groups will be so different that they cannot be called a single species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.The emergence of a species is seen as a necessary consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans produce (i.e., exhale).
The plants get their nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its era, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 claw-like teeth plus a second set of teeth in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything to get in its way.
We don't know for sure, but he probably had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other amphibians, and possibly carnivores.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could match it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of exotic or unusual feasting items, including wild boar, peacocks, lizards, and a type of rodent called a lizard.
A second difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals seated on benches, the rich men preferred to feast together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the foods that in later centuries came to Europe from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa and none of the ancient Romans had a taste for turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods and considered it the house of the god.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the gods during festivals and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard that leads to a secure courtyard that can only be entered by priests.
Unique pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for God.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, houses were of little importance.
Most Jewish family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the square; shops were just open tables overlooking the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland has been inhabited by humans sporadically. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and called it Grønland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there before.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, though each country was Scandinavian in origin.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The reverse of the Declaration of Independence bears the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although the author of this portion of the text is not precisely known, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 293⁄4 inches × 241⁄2 inches) was originally in a fold-out shelf.
So, it is likely that the code was simply added as a label.
The landings on that fateful day and the battles that followed led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was never liberated.
Vichy France ruled.These are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what was known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French troops had liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work together as a community.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, also reflected in the social hierarchy.
Autonomous cities are like the ancestors of nations.Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lingering cultural imprint and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Microcultures very often disappear without leaving any real historical evidence or being recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government - of which Congress was the sole constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to tax, and in the absence of a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, it has no authority to override interstate tax laws and tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended and the states mocked the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with the Germany national football team, the second most successful football team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan comprises, Japan is often referred to - from a geographical perspective - as an "archipel".
Taiwan began to be revived in the 15th century when European sailors visiting recorded the island as Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to diversify native grain production and employ Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and Taiwan was proclaimed a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered and restoration work continues today.
For example, the most common film format for still photographs in the world is 35 mm, the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
Its production continues to this day, but most importantly the form of the image sensors in digital cameras has inherited the aspect ratio of the image.
The 35 mm model is actually, slightly squashed, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this figure is (when divided by 12 to get the ratio of the simplest integer) therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the Advanced Image System group of formats) have a width-to-height ratio equal to or nearly this.
The oft-misused and much-laughed-at triangle rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining some degree of systemicity.
Notably, the most prominent place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the triangle vertically and horizontally (see illustration).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European countries together for over a millennium despite differences in language and customs.
The overwhelming power I possessed affected everyone from the king to the parish.
A core Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's cash funds exist specifically for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the church in Rome had the central authority, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the requirements of the creed were being met.
Britain immediately began blockading Germany by sea after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has blocked international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire stretches of ocean, threatening even ships that have already entered the war.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid falling into this situation again in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's phases or dynasties in power was of a different type.
In addition, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each ruling dynasty.The most notable of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period a fierce war broke out between several nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles for the top posts at the Great Hall of the Qian.
There are many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just to the ruler.
Also, since the Revolution, the professions have been open to all male applicants and this has allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on class, military ranks are now based on rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to unleash their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent the Gar which became known as the 'Hara' on the mountain 'Al-Nur' for meditation.
The Gar itself, which has survived through the ages, provides a very vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a hill to the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find even if you know where it is. Once you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
And you can see nothing but the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century of the current era, the Great Pyramid is one of several monumental pyramids built to house the tombs of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "City of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), miniature tombs, temples, and a mausoleum.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honour of Khufu's wives and other members of his family.
It has an upward "V" shape and a downward "V" shape like a triangle or a square without a side.
A high sign indicates that you should start at the edge and push the arrow, while a low sign indicates that you should start at the end of the arrow (where your hand holds the arrow) and pull it down.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and more toned
Feel free to draw your own markings in pencil, and just remember that the curved printed markings are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected in general.
Terrified, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Mary Therese, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of women merchants.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd shouting and cheering against the King and Queen.
A mob was able to force the King and Queen to open the windows of their car on their knees.
One of the gang members once brandished the head of one of the royal guards killed at Versailles in front of a horrified queen.
The Filipino people paid for the imperialist war expenses of the United States of America by invading the Philippines.
These had to pay taxes to the American colonial system in order to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the large profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the main gain of American imperialism.
We must understand the context in which the organization was created, in order to understand the Templars.
The era in which these events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages and covers the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, the latter of which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the drive for technology or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is tied to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Two general ideas are shared by most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path of cultural or political influence, and that these technologies in turn have "impacts" on associated, rather than societal, societies.
For example, one might say that a car's engine should have road maintenance.
But establishing a nationwide road network is not economically viable if there are few cars, so new roads must be developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to an increased rate of road accidents, which leads to the development of new technologies in health care to treat the affected people.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Weisch and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time customs and culture related to that geography developed, and these, as they were consistent with a society's place, were superior to laws enforced by force.
Just as Paris is famously known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its decline during the 12th century was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were worth much more than what the Byzantine markets brought in.
By this time Paris had been dubbed the capital of fashion instead of Constantinople.
Gothic reached its zenith sometime between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, patterns in the West may be as late as 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments at the time was that as a result of the Crusades people started using rice to tie clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture cultivated to produce enough food for only the farmer and his family to eat.
Subsistence farming - often without fertilizers or toxins - is a simple system that uses stored seeds that are adapted to the ecosystem of the area, as well as a rotation system or other relatively simple techniques with the aim of increasing yield.
Most farmers have historically worked in subsistence agriculture, and this tradition is present in many developing countries.
Subcultures reconcile like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, race, class, location and/or gender of members.
The traits that define a subculture's identity may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership by various symbolic uses of style that include clothing, costumes, and terminology.
Among the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by citing a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck or intentional abuse, were socially isolated from adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "savages" or "savages". Some homeless children have been locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment was due to the parents' refusal to treat the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have been abused as children or severely traumatized before being abandoned or escaping.
Others say they were raised by animals; others say they lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by nonhuman animals, feral children's behavior (within physical limits) is very similar to that of a pet, such as fear of humans or being irresponsible.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further than that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather a tool that provides support for individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and real, and in other words, a tutor is a form of interactive learning, similar to a Microsoft Office Clipboard.
Interactive learning is supported in the software and aims to ask questions, motivate and explain actions that a student would otherwise have difficulty coping with alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not value upbringing, care and education, but they do.
We understand that the foster care system is a safe haven for these uneducated.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The surrogate carer must provide all the essentials that were missing in the previously evacuated homes.
The Internet combines elements of both public and private communication.
The peculiarities of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and modes of content.
For example, some suggest that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eime and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reaction to websites".
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting facial expressions, which are facial movements that last for a fraction of a second.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting the exact expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks noted in his paper that the President's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
It also suggests that these abilities to analyze human behavior may be shared by some animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown two groups of Chinese varieties: a subtle group and an exaggerated group.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the aggregate of expressional variation.
The process of separation and reassortment work to make the variation randomly go back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with a digestive system similar to humans have difficulty obtaining the amino acids they need from available plant resources.
Failure to do so can also lead to serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most abundant plant resources were proteins that we could obtain from leaves and legumes, but these proteins would be difficult for primates like us to digest if they were uncooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digested, but are high in protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to the way chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Insomnia is a sleep disorder in which you wake up deliberately during your normal sleep period and go back to sleep a short time later (10 to 60 minutes).
You can easily do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting a clock during sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to stop it.
The second option, based on biosystems, involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his or her body and mind.
If you reduce stress, you increase the positivity that life gives. Everyone has the inherent ability to find peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing holding us back on the path to that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but developed through the Mahayana path of love and secondary techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yuga. Through the visualization of the various deities, they purify energy channels, activate gratitude, and create a consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, and this left the Soviet Union and the United States of America to suffer, but with the end of the war, the clash of systems, procedures and cultures led to conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was to last for the next forty years, being fought on the ground, by proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed beyond repair, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Roman Bridge.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers crossed into the Soviet Union and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of cargo ships is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's role has been to ensure your country's ability to transport its own people and goods, while at the same time, intercepting your enemy's ability to transport their own people and goods.
A notable modern example is the North Atlantic Campaign of the Second World War. where the Americans attempted to transport personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean in order to aid the British.
Meanwhile, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion with its submarine-based weapon.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have invaded Britain as it had done the rest of Europe.
The goat appears to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to be preserved because milk, hair, meat and leather were easily accessible.
Dairy goats were generally reared in herds that roamed hills or secondary grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, in the same way as the more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
The carriage road was invented in England sometime in the 16th century.
Although the early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the roads which were considered too rough at the time.
Railroad sleepers were invented a little early to fix the tracks, but it later turned out that over time putting a railroad over the tracks made it more efficient.
This has become a tradition, but the iron has caused the wooden wheels of the carts to wear out more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first complete iron bars were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation; humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, is not consistently positively correlated.
Species with two legs were found in the fossil record of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 Ma, although coelacanths may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce future suffering a little bit.
This is just like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems, and we must end them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed dramatically due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and that problems have become more acute due to the increase in population and the human luxury lifestyle.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary of the Treasury Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's press.
During the night we printed between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap Cash Notes".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read by troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The Dunlap Twenty-five Fold Scripts represent the earliest surviving copies of the United States Declaration of Independence document, but the original handwritten copy is no longer extant.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day. They are called birds.
Many do not think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that look very much like dinosaurs.
They have feet with outer shells and claws, and are oviparous, and walk on hind legs like a lorraine.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on the processing of information encoded in binary digits.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits - or bits, if we use the terminology of computer language.
Endotoxicity may not be immediately symptomatic, and a prompt diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as thrush, which are common enough, appear.
A poisoned interior may be best indicated by an open can of poison medication or household chemicals.
Read the label for first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
Entomologists use the term "bugs" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to infest humans.
Both bed bugs and killer bugs have a long incubation period, and they have adapted to living in their host's nest or home.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that females are twice as likely as males to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or that of their child to raise a child.
Such couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption , the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another spouse can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
It is not unique in this regard, however, as experimentation is testing that can be used to test the validity of one or more potential hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
They accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are critically dependent on the presence of and produced by circadian rhythms.
They have also established cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclic signals, in most organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are oscillators that persist for periods of consecutive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first major demonstrations that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses or parasites to introduce their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to characterize either DNA of the replicate using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are stem cell-line cells.
Mutations in germline cells can only be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be to visit, photograph and learn about the Bornean orangutans.
People leave small towns by car every morning to go to their places of work and are met on the way by other people who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation medium, everyone is somewhat supported and connected by a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this carbon-based mega-economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable states that underpinned human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses public transport. Everyone complains about public transport.
You rarely hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down.
Why do transit systems like this generate such complaints, and not fail every day? Are transit engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of motorists and individual vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic studies are difficult because one cannot predict the behavior of a driver with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic has a reasonably consistent frequency, which can be expressed mathematically approximately.
To better illustrate traffic flow, they made relationships between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot spread their wings today are the dragonfly and the Mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some found it correct and many others believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth including the Sun (and other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the ground moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes measuring up to 6 miles in width.
20% of the water that the world's rivers discharge into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the Pyramids of Giza are unsurpassed in size and architectural excellence.
The ancient Egyptians in the modern kingdom were fascinated by the relics of their ancestors, which had been buried for over a thousand years.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most state functionaries, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
The existence of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper has been known since ancient times, as all of these elements are found in nature in their native form and can be extracted in a relatively simple way using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This was analogous to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although it also assumed that they change into new materials to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a combination of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are metals such as silver and gold as well.
You can also get alloys that contain trace amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could take the place of the dot at the end of this sentence.
Since then, the pencil has been a good friend to many people until it disappeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the pencil has been relegated to less prominence and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, without having to use a pen.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works by gathering energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. The core breaks down again and some of that energy comes out.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei which means they tend to decay with little or no movement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The shellfish reaches about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under Maria and thicker under the Highlands.
There may be more lunar oceans on the near side because the crust is less thick. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are about finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that automatically become manifest when they reach puberty.
These theories look at what makes some people like the things they do and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of contents are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's second factor theory.
In general, stereotyping can appear when managers begin to label former co-workers as attempting to remain "the same as everyone else" (or everyone else).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary action, performance appraisals, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, the individual becomes so unrecognizable that he feels he must change everything the team does and has.
In the end, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to friction between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical colleagues.
They often have greater autonomy than traditional team members as their teams may congregate according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real "stealth team" was described by Larson and LaFausto, 1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the Invisible Team management team. Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to create an educational organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the goals of applying the concepts of institutional learning.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
Because of this, collaboration within an organization to overcome barriers can lead to new innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization is able to innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning.
(Angel (2006), defines sustainability as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The data associated with neuroscience provide concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to knowledge investigation. They thus narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The intersection between brain and behavioral pathology supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in ways we never could before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for constructing simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is also a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence involves making machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is currently being used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been used to build many software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any semester. Often a teacher will want to take her students to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Technology enables the solution through virtual field visits. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a good way to remember a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capitol, and the website is redesigned each year, but old versions are kept online for archival purposes.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, a blogger will start by writing better to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "force students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can "allow students to become more analytical and critical; and through active response to online material, students can identify their own positions within the context of others' writing as well as form their own opinions on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital with a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
You can find Niagara Falls in the far south, and in the north is a landscape of natural beauty that has not been explored in Moscow and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as the Canadian gem to outsiders.
The larger areas of the north are sparsely populated and some almost unpopulated.
A census comparison that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and is a separate continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent states, or associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs introduced Islam to the country, and it was widely spread in the Comoros and Maui.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the African coast, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wives: Regardless of actual marital status, wives should declare that they are already married.
It would be better to wear a ring (but not the expensive-looking one).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they may consider harassment and that it is common to be spotted, held in the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stick to your guns (cultural differences don't make it acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids used modern Casablanca as a strategic port named "Napa" after its foundation by Berber hunters in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar-ul-Labadia, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old town, such as pots, pottery, leather goods, silk and all kinds of cheap goods, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda .
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo which covered most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside Goma are essential to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, whereas Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can ride a Buda Buda (motorcycle taxi) around Goma, and the usual fare (local) is about 500 CFA francs for a short trip.
Besides being somewhat elusive, "Timbuktu" has also come to be used as a metaphor for faraway foreign lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is considered a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and because of its airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates on his PBS series The Wonders of the African World.
The city differs markedly from the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is considered one of the major attractions in South Africa, and is also the main park of the South African National Parks.
There is a daily fee for maintenance and access to the park, as there are in all South African national parks.
You'd better buy a Wild Card, as it gives you access to a select group of South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is where many tourists consider their hometown.
The row of buildings that line Hong Kong's skyline resembles a glittering graph that appears above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Marine Column on the opposite side.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated heavily on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is where the British colonists made their home, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world 's largest inland sea coastline, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 mi) along the coastline of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located within the Indian Territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last evidence of the dense forests that once covered the Ganges valley.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres, of which about a third is covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer roaming the area.
Buses depart from the Inter-District (Across-the-River) station during the day, although most especially those bound for the East and Jakkar/Pomthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the intercity buses are usually full, it is better to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable and powerful Japanese coaches.
Taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around to nearby places, such as Barrow (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Ouyapouk River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Ouyapouk River connecting the cities of Ouyapouk in Brazil and Saint-Georges-du-Ouyapouk in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long, and have two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres . Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017 .
The bridge is due to be fully operational in September 2017, in time for the expected completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, the Guarani lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to secondary groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, gathering of plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", arose as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, at the Polo Grounds in Las Canitas.
Besides that minor leagues and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Argentine polo association .
The official currency of Falkland is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the Pound Sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the islands' only bank located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
Pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars more often.
In outlying islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance for accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland's currency outside the islands, so you must exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo lies just south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and moisture combine to make the air colder than the thermometer would indicate.
The amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year, as there are no defined "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wild animals!
As elusive as they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals are vulnerable.
Many guests are injured every year, because they do not sit back, and these animals are big and wild and dangerous so they have to be given special space.
Also, be careful as the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser sank. About 200 Americans and Germans were drowned.
During the struggle for independence organized by Mao's movement, a peaceful demonstration in the town resulted in the death of Supreme Leader Topoah Tassi Lilofi III.
Because of Auckland's location between two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular of which is located in three areas.
The North Shore (North Harbor District) beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy making swimming safe, and most are shaded by trees of botox.
Tamaki Road Beaches is located on Whitimata Harbour, on the outskirts of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good selection of shops lining the beach. It is safe to swim.
The main beer is known as Beer No. 1, which is not a complex beverage, but rather a pleasant and refreshing drink. The second local beer is called Manta.
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps more popular.
The water from the local tap is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water, if you're afraid.
To Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is a strange one. A small black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino has a layer of cream (no foam) on top, and they serve the tea without milk.
The dark chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent although expensive.
They make many trips to the reef throughout the year, and reefs rarely get damaged for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, observe all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. It can occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will run away when they see humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A traveler who makes a reservation in advance can be sure that he will have a place to stay until he reaches his destination.
Although you may find that it is possible to book secondary forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
Travel agents usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined packages including flights and hotels.
They can also reserve a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain second documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any adjustments or requests must first be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of festival goers choose to camp on site and consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you have to get in early so you can get a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may have ended, some sections of the festival may have continued playing music into the late hours of the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are travelling through the northern Baltic in winter, you should check the cabin position, as the passage through the ice causes a lot of noise for the most vulnerable people.
The Saint Petersburg cruises include a short walk in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually missing, and it may be difficult to find exits.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment, to keep guests happy and to keep them in the building.
Some establishments will serve alcohol for free, but getting drunk hinders good judgment and teaches all good gamblers the importance of keeping a clean mind.
Anyone driving on high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as smoothly as on soft ground.
During blizzards, enough snow may fall to make you stop for a very short time.
It may be caused by snowfall, hailstorms, condensation processes or the presence of ice on car windows in limited visibility.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic flows almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safari tours are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and most popular with many visitors.
The term safari tour is commonly used to refer to traveling across the country to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars and standard equipment allows good viewing.
Lions, elephants and tigers are sometimes shy and can be easily seen through binoculars.
Hiking safaris (also called "jungle walks", "jungle hikes" or "jungle hikes") consist of walking for long distances, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events in the Games rescheduled to be held in different locations in Japan.
After Tokyo hosted the 1964 Olympics, it became the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will no longer apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were due to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to fetch between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen while the standard fare will be around 7,000 yen.
A cooker helps dry wet clothes. Many hotels provide a cooker and a coffee table for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no coffee, or you don't like to wear a beverage cooler, then you can try using an air dryer, if available.
Do not overheat the cloth (in the worst case it may shrink or burn).
There are different methods of purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some places you can only heat the water for a minute, in other places you need to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers are likely to encounter pests that are unfamiliar to their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases cause allergies, spread toxins, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully infect or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without having to pay taxes or duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can, at times, save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and cigarettes.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it passes regularly through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow passages and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections  typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is paramount.
Strangely enough, cell service seems to be much stronger here than in other areas along the route, such as the Pennsylvania woods.
German pastry is excellent, and in Bavaria it is very rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are popular with apples cooking in pies all year round while cherries and plums appear in summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts, and the popular cake is often eaten specially with a cup of coffee in the center.
If you want a small, rich pastry, try the so-called Berliner, Vankucken or Krapffen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry spices can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, the use of yogurt in curry is widespread, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, the use of coconut milk is common.
Indonesian cuisine represents an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of regional cuisines spread across Indonesia, due to Indonesia's 17,000 islands to differentiate them.
However, when used without further qualifiers, the term tends to imply that the food originated in the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely distributed throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of dishes that are simply spiced, the predominant flavours of which are ground peanuts, spices, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic condiments.
The collars serve as footrests for the rider's feet that rest on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns because of the possibility of a rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but his foot gets caught in the bridle, the horse may pull him back if he runs too far. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with very tight heels and soft soles.
Secondly, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle to fall off the saddle when the saddle is pulled back when the rider is getting off.
Cusamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with its diverse walls and large granite boulders.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes between the endless walls of possibility, where peaks offer spectacular views from above.

In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking, but you will rarely reach long-distance skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and equipped trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means having to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen Area acts somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to go through customs twice.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for entry visas for each individual Schengen member state, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
Some tax authorities classify antiques as being goods over a hundred years old, but there is no universal definition of what constitutes an artifact.
The definition includes geographical differences, where the life expectancy may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Crafts may be recognized as artifacts even though they are more recent than similar goods mass-produced in the distant past.

A rip current is the backflow of waves that cross a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Due to the underwater terrain, the backflow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current into the deep water may form there.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back in is no less easy.
Try targeting an area where you can't be caught by the current again or, depending on your skills and whether someone notices your presence, waiting for a rescue might be a second option.
The return trip trauma occurs more quickly than the culture shock (shortening the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have a particularly hard time re-adapting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your familiar customs from your home country.
