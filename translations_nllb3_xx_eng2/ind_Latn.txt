ZMapp, one of the earliest antibody cocktails in the field, raised hopes, but some formal studies indicated that its benefits in preventing death were less than expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that has been widely disseminated, but it can also provide details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is chestnut-brown on the upper side with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed stem, called a rachis, but had other features - spines and barbels - researchers concluded that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature or appearance adjustment. The researchers argue that, although this is a dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult bird feathers, not chickens' feathers.
The researchers argued that, although this was a baby dinosaur tail, the sample showed adult bird feathers, not chickens' feathers.

Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision following special procedures.

The road to the crash site was temporarily closed and emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with murdering his own son.
He's being held pending charges and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may have been tainted because his photos have been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts view the publication of the photo as potentially prejudicial.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous path if they publish photos of suspects, etc".
The Crown Office, which is overall responsible for the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, would refer to a border dispute, which the Palestinians wanted based on borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reported were the future of Jerusalem sanctified by both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence for ten years in the valley once the deal is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control trials must be closely monitored by the guards as the trials are monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation had received thorough training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of calculations to move the country towards new elections.
The inspection was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the cancellation of elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
There were 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods marked by overheating, causing six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the device.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional heat incidents, which the company called "not serious".
"The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake shook the Marianas at 0719 local time (21.19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said that no damage was reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman captures a Hong Kong tourist by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, have been released early, as have the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who wanted to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in the medical field.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that when given hormones, the fetal lungs mature more quickly.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Even his fellow wrestlers paid homage to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer says, 'Luna was the first Extreme Queen, my first manager, and she died on the night of her second month, unique as she was, a strong woman.'
"Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as scary as I was... maybe even more so... I loved her and I'm going to miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In a poll on this view, 34 percent of them wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarchical leader of Australia.
At the extreme, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her fitness status was also in doubt.
He was unable to take the medication needed to relieve his pain, as it was banned from the Olympic games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has found the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets are the source of the delivery of water to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially Earth, since comets collided with Earth in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He speculates on running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, rather than older technology based on ground-based radar, to make it easier for air traffic controllers to find the exact location of aircraft with better precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport will be operated and no diesel trains will stop at Wembley.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increase the likelihood that the match will be forced to be played indoors without fans.
A study published in the journal Scientific on Thursday reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, a process previously thought to have taken much longer, due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many forms, including being rolled into small shapes.
Gold could be drawn into thin wires, which could be twisted and woven, forged or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made so thin that it sticks to other metals, or so thin that it is sometimes used as a decoration for hand paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
The hydrogen ion is a proton that is stripped of its electron (because the hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders into one, then squeeze into balls with a clean, wet hand.
The moisture in your hand will react with the outer layer, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of the sewer system are found in many houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also found, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes integrated with public baths, where men and women used them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and bounce it back, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of the light and our view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in a tremendous way, and the biggest thing it has done for us is give us easier and faster transportation.
It takes us to trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
The medium-sized cat below preys on medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special job carried by each cat to keep them from competing with the other cats.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male siblings, along with 30 females and their offspring.
Females are usually closely knit together, like a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also extremely deadly to their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for long distances, and pull with five times the force of a human.
Tigers are still a group (genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a full-grown lion, but more like words uttered with a roar, a cry.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, and will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can, but almost all the animals it hunts are much smaller.
Scientists believe that the ocelot follows and searches for prey by sniffing, sniffing out tracks of prey on the ground.
They have night vision, and they move very quietly, and they hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then ambushing their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from its original main population (such as if they move to a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often encounter a different environment from the one they occupied before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so new populations need different features or adaptations to be able to compete more strongly than they needed to before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they seem to shrink like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this the process of speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they inhale the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make houses from plants and we make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time so it feared nothing but its fellow mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an extra row of teeth at the top of its mouth, meaning that nothing can escape when it passes through its mouth.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that its tongue was branched, that it fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and that it may have been a cannibal all along.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, including giant dinosaurs like T. rex that can't compete with it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a rat.
And the rich man is not one of those who eat, but he eats in the midst of the rich.
Ancient Roman food could not carry the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
The people would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctum that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes a special pyramidal tower, called a ziggurat, was built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home is not so important.
Most Jewish family life takes place out in the open.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just open counters facing the street, stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the Land of Canaan, which is why the price of wood was so high.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his findings, the Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, despite the writing on the back, this document is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written "The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document in reverse. "
Although no one knows for sure who wrote them, it is known that in early times large parchment documents (measuring 29⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) were rolled up for safekeeping.
So, the notation was most likely inserted as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"The area was ruled by the Vichy French, who were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them".
"The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, in what was dubbed Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture run together by a group of people who live and work together, as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also serves as a measure of the size of a society.
City states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge across generations, the traces of culture that remain, and the distribution of knowledge that is appropriate.
Minority cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a viable civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to impose taxes. Since there is no national executive or judiciary, Congress relies on state authorities, who are often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Nor does it have the authority to override interstate tax and tariff regulations.
The articles require unanimous consent of all the states before they can be amended, while the states ignore the central government so their representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, are the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bicycle racing, ice hockey, field hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern region, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu) making Japan the 7th largest island in the world
"As a result of the cluster of islands that Japan possesses, Japan in geographical terms is often referred to as an "island"
The origins of Taiwan go back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, and initiated a transformation in local grain production practices and hired Chinese laborers to work in its rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists have a better idea of what the original looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its ratios have been inherited by the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format group) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The most frequently violated and underestimated rule of thirds is the simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is said that the most effective place for such a main subject is the meeting of the lines that separate the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this historical period in Europe, the Catholic Church (which became wealthy and powerful) was closely monitored.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite their differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervasive power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the principles of Christian teaching is that wealth should be used to overcome suffering and poverty. The church's monetary funds are available for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this centralization of power and money caused many to question whether this teaching had been fulfilled.
As soon as hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As a result of the limited response to this tactic, the Germans suspected a similar response to the unrelenting submarine battles.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, many nations set out to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different time periods; each stage in China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
In addition, in the interval of each dynasty there was a period of instability of the divided provinces. The most popular of these is the Three Kingdoms epic which takes place in the interval of 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting for the highest seats in the great palace at Xi'an.
There were many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolute rule to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belonged to the people, not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the revolution, job openings were opened to all male applicants, opening up opportunities for success to those who were most ambitious.
The same goes for the military because instead of soldier ranks being based on class, they're now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class citizens from other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often visited the cave later known as "Hira'" on Mount "Nur" (light) to meditate".
His self-containment, which endures through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca City, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, this place is not easy to find even when one knows that this place exists.
Nothing could be seen but the beautiful clear sky above and the surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a majestic Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The "up" arcs look like a V and the "down" arcs look like staples or squares with no underside".
Up means you have to start at the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward friction usually produces a softer sound, whereas downward friction is stronger and more emphatic.
Feel free to write your own mark, but there is a musical reason for the printed bow mark, so usually the mark must be obeyed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were on 6 October 1789 forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they journey back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and calling out threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, one of the mob members held up the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The US imperialist war expenditure in conquering the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to finance much of the spending and interest on bonds floating on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The profits made from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are of course the basic gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Kenisah, one must understand the context that drove the creation of the order.
The High Middle Ages is the name commonly given to the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages extended from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500 by convention.
Technological determinism is a term whose practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the impetus of technology or the necessity of technology to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic associated with scientific laws as well as their technological manifestations.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influences, and that technology ultimately has an inherent "effect" on society, rather than being merely socially conditioned".
For example, one might say that cars should lead to the development of highways.
However, the national highway network was not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also led to high rates of road accidents, which led to the discovery of new techniques in the medical world to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had considerable elements of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and these, in harmony with the place of society, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the contemporary fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury lasted from about 400 to about 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, particularly as the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the western style can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time was the result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to tighten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with rotation farming and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in self-sufficient agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that distinguish one subculture from another may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures typically mark their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, among them fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take advantage of some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, are not socialized by adults as they grow up.
"Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child neglect is due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairment".
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some people say they have lived in the wild themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of certain animals that care for them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Whereas project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support tool that provides support to individuals who are undergoing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a scaffolding but so is the little paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalized in software and aims to question, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too great a challenge for students to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
Children should not grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care, and educate, but that is the reality.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
Our child care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care should provide for all the needs that are not present in the home where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to an additional dimension in terms of usage and approach to gratification.
"For example, 'learning' and 'socializing' are suggested as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995). "
"Personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recorders led to the important discovery of the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements, that occur in milliseconds.
Specifically, it states that we can detect whether someone is lying by observing their microexpressions correctly.
In his paper entitled The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how a person who cannot understand speech because of brain damage is still able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior in such a way may be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two genetic variations: hidden and revealed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, whereas selection removes it from the group of expression variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with human-like digestive systems to meet their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences, namely, growth depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant source of protein is found in leaves and nuts, but it's difficult for primates like us to digest, unless it's cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors coped with the 'protein problem' in a way that is almost similar to that of the chimpanzees on the savannah today".
A sleep disorder is the process of waking up deliberately during a period of normal sleep, and then falling asleep shortly afterward (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to keep you awake without waking you up completely.
If you reset the clock while you sleep, then the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to stand up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing people to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force there is.
The only thing that's stopping us is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism took the foundation of Buddhist teachings, but then expanded it with the focus on mahayana love and with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the God of Yoga, through the visualization of the various gods the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which resulted in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the U.S. With the end of the war and the conflict of systems, processes, and cultures resulted in the collapse of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in the flesh, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
However, this plan became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian guard after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods has long been the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job is traditionally to ensure that your country is able to maintain its ability to move people and goods, and at the same time, to impede your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most important and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in WWII, where the Americans tried to move troops and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mostly used U-boats, was trying to prevent this congestion.
If the Allies fail, Germany may be able to conquer Britain as it has done with other European countries.
Goats seem to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise goats for their milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats tend to be used by children or adults, similar to those more familiar to shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the tracks were only made of parallel wooden planks, the horses could pull the carriages faster and with more weight than the rougher roads at the same time.
Rail bearings were introduced early on to hold tracks in place, but it was slowly realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels on the trains to break down more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first railway made entirely of iron was born.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and with the emergence of Homo erectus two million years ago, humans began walking upright.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as it usually does.
Bipedal specialisations are found in Australopithcus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the impact of our actions in the future.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to deactivate it.
It is quite clear that the world is developing because of science and technology, and overpopulation and human wasteful lifestyles are becoming quite a big problem.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was taken several blocks to John Dunlap's printing shop.
"Overnight about 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
A lot of people don't think they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet, there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be seen in the presence of open storage of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the first-aid instructions specific to a particular toxin.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from a long-standing familiarity with the louse, which is an insect that is extremely adaptable as a parasite on humans.
Both the Killer Flea and the Mattress Moth are nidicolous animals, adapted to live in their nests or host houses.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal nerves, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise the child.
The couple can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the birth parents withdraw their custody so that another spouse can care for the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most of the scientific research.
It's not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and specifically on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, have been accepted.
As interest in Greek knowledge waned, the West found itself drawn away from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Much of the attention to rhythm in physiology and behavior often depends on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue periods of cycling freely even when no external cues are present.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that stated that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into the bacteria.
They've done two experiments, which is to label the DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus and label the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of a mutation can vary, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ lineage cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to the child, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to natural areas to enjoy natural scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as learning information about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to work and meet others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on the personal car.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has unleashed the biosphere from one of the stable states that for the past two million years has supported human evolution.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaint about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do such complaints arise about the transportation system, why do their services always fail? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on right now?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and are more or less mathematically representable.
To better represent traffic flows, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to explore space, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings parallel to their bodies.
This gives them a wider choice of small-sized places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and dragonfly flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many believe otherwise; the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), moves around the earth.
This seems to make sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and first largest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, measuring some six miles [9.6 km].
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the various rivers to the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and engineering perfection of the Giza pyramid construction was never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt admired the monuments of its predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of the people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of these can be found in nature in their original forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four properties of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transformed into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have a metal alloy that contains a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of an atom is so incredibly small that the dot at the end of this sentence could contain several trillion atoms.
When it first appeared, the pencil was a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the status and use of the pencil was degraded.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to use a ruler.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus again and releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that atoms tend to break apart with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km at the nearest side and 100 km at the farthest side.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the plateaus.
There's probably more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner, and the Lahar is easier to get to the surface.
Satisfaction theory centers on finding out what moves people or what interests them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow into adulthood.
It analyzes the characteristics of people that make them want something, and the factors in the environment that make them do or not do something.
Two well-known theories of charge are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
"In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or women)".
Managers with this type of personality have difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual, who feels he has to change everything the team has done and do it alone.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to division between the leader and the team members.
Virtual teams have the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as a point of contact for their live physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
"The presence of a real 'stealth team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The stealth team is the management team where each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member".
Why would organizations want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to solve problems can give rise to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as share organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive inquiry, and therefore narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavioral changes and some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real problems in life.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as have been built into some home computer applications and video game software.
Tours are an important part of school life, and often a teacher is happy to take his students to places where they cannot use the bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing travel artwork virtually is also a great way to reflect on travel and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is redesigned, but the old version is kept online for a sticker book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Meanwhile, students usually start to feel the experience of blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience in general changes that.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, bloggers began to work on improving the quality of their writing to avoid criticism.
"In addition, blogs also "force students to be more literate about the world around them". The need to satisfy an audience inspires students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogs are tools that inspire collaboration, and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school.
"The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical: by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their position in the context of other writings and also outline their opinions on a number of issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it features art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Far to the south are Niagara Falls and to the north are the untouched natural beauties of Muskoka and its surroundings.
All of these and a host of other things have made Ontario what outsiders consider to be essentially Canadian.
The vast areas to the north are very sparsely inhabited and some are even virtually uninhabitable wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and it flourished in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bordered on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
If you also wear a ring it will be very helpful (do not make it look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as harassment and not infrequently this is followed by a clutch on the arm, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to defend your opinions (cultural differences or not, does not mean that it can be left unchallenged!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya. The city was later named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookah pipes, and various geegaws, but all of these are reserved for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme eastern region near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the base for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest trips to look for tracks of the Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (boat) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
"Due to its relatively inaccessible location, 'Timbuktu' has been used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant land".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was included in the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
The site was one of the main stops on the PBS special, Wonders of the World in Africa by Henry Louis Gates.
It is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, it imposes a daily entry and conservation fee.
It may also be profitable for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which grants entry to a select few parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The row of buildings that make Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glittering bar chart is made clearer by its reflection in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the seaside of Kowloon across the street.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is crammed into the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took as their own and if you're looking for evidence of colonial territory in the past, this is the right place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part of the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just a mangrove swamp - it includes some of the trees still standing in the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/wetland areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a haven for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are usually full, so it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by the small, comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster Bus.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 metres long, and was completed in August 2011, opening to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is planned to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the GuaycurÃo and the PayaguÃ¡, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Province of the Indians", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournament and where to buy tickets to the polo match, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere throughout the island, in the city of Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted.
Exchanging Falklands currency outside the island is almost impossible, so do it before you leave the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, summer there coincides with winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winters can be bitterly cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the numbers on the thermometer.
"There is no 'rainy' or 'dry' season: the amount of rainfall is almost always the same throughout the year".
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to human contact, the wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wild animals.
No matter how good they look, bison, deer, big deer, bears, and almost any other large animal can strike.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract the attention of bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking foul-smelling food and keep your tent clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle run by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city culminated in the assassination of an important leader: Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's position covering two harbours.
The North Shore (included in the North Harbour district) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of its beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most have shade provided by rows of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes family-friendly beaches with nice shops lining the shore.
"The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but a fun and refreshing one. The other local beer is called 'Manta'".
There are plenty of French wines to go around, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel.
Local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're scared.
To Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is a foreign one - black coffee is espresso, cappuccino comes with a high cream (rather than foam) content, and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Many tours of the reef take place year-round, and accidents on the reef are very rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near the coast and near the estuary from October to April above 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
The saltwater crocodile is an inactive marine crocodile, whose primary habitat is in the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, assuring them that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through travel agents.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also reserve a reservation for you if you need time to consider an offer or obtain other documents for your purpose (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should be arranged through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival participants decide to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the show, then you have to come early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there are parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have camping areas reserved for families with young children.
If you are visiting the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as the noise is exceptional when crossing the ice, especially for those who are most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the requirements).
Casinos usually make great efforts to optimize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings, to keep the mood of the guests, and to keep them on site.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness spoils the clarity of mind, and all serious gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or across mountainous regions needs to take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On a slippery, snowy highway, friction is low and you can't drive like on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, you can get caught in the snow that quickly falls.
Sight range may also be limited by falling or blown snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are normal in many countries and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari refers to a journey by land to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to get close to cars, so standard equipment already allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes prefer to hide and can be seen better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also referred to as a "hike in the bush", "safari hike", or "walk") involves a hike, either for a few hours or a few days".
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, after the first one in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympics have been scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for borrowing, even if they are not available in the room.
If ironing is not available or you do not want to wear ironing socks, you can use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are a variety of ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is considered sufficient, while in others it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you may want to consider buying sealed bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them in their homeland.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or spread disease.
Self-infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with their force, do not usually fall into the category of pests.
Shopping at duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy goods that are tax-free and duty-free in a number of locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save money on such products as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through remote inland areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: there are many steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp bends.
The existing speed limits are lower than the previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is important to adhere to them strictly rather than the other way around.
Although, oddly enough, cell service is stronger here than anywhere else along this route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German dry cakes are quite tasty, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cake is common, with apples being cooked into a dry cake all year round, and then there are cherries and plums present in the summer.
Many German pastries also serve almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but richly flavored cake, try between Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region you are in.
Curry is a dish consisting of spices and seasonings, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
"Cari can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid. "
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes. In South India and a number of other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
There are 17,000 islands to choose from, though Indonesian food is a general term that represents the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, serving a variety of simple spicy dishes. The main spices favored by Javanese taste are peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle is a support for the driver's legs that hangs on either side of any saddle.
It provides greater stability for the rider, but potentially poses safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's foot getting caught in it.
To minimize the risk, a number of safety precautions are in place to prevent a rider from being thrown from a horse but having his foot caught in the stirrups.
First, most drivers wear driving boots with smooth, narrow heels and soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle's skin to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Nicknamed the Yosemite of South America, Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochama Valley, has a variety of cliffs and huge granite rock walls.
The highest part of the walls offers a spectacular view from the summit, and climbers from all over the world continue to create new routes between the boundless potential of the walls.
The sport of downhill snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
"Skiing has become a major travel activity with many enthusiasts sometimes dubbed "ski bums", who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing has been around since about the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski climbing.
It is related to but usually has nothing to do with ski touring or alpine style climbing, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much sturdier boots and skis.
Think of the ski trail as a familiar hiking trail.
When conditions are good, you can travel farther than you can walk - but rarely can you ski cross-country as fast without carrying a heavy backpack on a well-groomed track.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to some of these countries requires that we apply for a visa and go through passport checks more than once.
The Schengen zone, however, works much like a country in this regard.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
