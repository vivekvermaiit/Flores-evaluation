In late 2017, "Semenov" was featured on QBC's TV Shopping Channel.
Ring settled a lawsuit with a rival security firm, IDT Corporation.
While there appears to be one experimental vaccine that could reduce Ebola mortality, as yet, there are no suitable drugs to treat the existing infection.
Aco was a mixture of one of the antibodies, ZMapp, and was initially thought to be safe in this setting, but formal studies found that the benefit of this combination was lower than expected to reduce mortality.
In the PALM trial, the drug ZMapp was used as the control standard, meaning that researchers used it as the basis and compared the other three treatments to me.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee 's message and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic Family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes .

The subject not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already common, but goes beyond this by providing details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown from the mouth and the underside pale or the same color as carotenes.
The discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers contain no evolutionarily complete skeletal sequence, called "backbones", but do possess secondary feather characteristics - such as protuberances and microbursts - researchers have concluded that the backbones were likely a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
Based on the structure of the wings, it appears that they were not used for flight but rather for thermoregulation or for display.The researchers suggest that although this tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and the muzzle of a juvenile dinosaur.
The researchers noted that although this tail was that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen showed adult bird feathers and no juvenile dinosaur.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning in a police station in Turkey's Gaziantep district, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: that the activity of all the stars in the system is governed solely by their luminosity and rotation.
The photometry and rotation are used together to assign a Rosebud number to the star, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less the star's activity relative to magnetic fluctuations.

As for the work that has been done, it is mostly theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made of the Milky Way.
The effect the team investigated is due to tidal and inland forces between the galactic dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon's pull on Earth causes tidal phenomena, the Milky Way's pull on the Milky Way causes tidal phenomena.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in much the same way as natural matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is not composed of a halo-like structure, but rather small particles in large numbers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters would insulate themselves in a booth, remove a piece of pre-printed paper and indicate their preferred candidate's name in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box, and signs it on the voter list.
The French electoral code severely restricts the procedure unfavourably.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no conditions at the start of voting, and that no one will add conditions other than those of registered voters and duly authorised by the commissioners.
Candidates may hire actors to supervise every part of the process. At night, votes are tallied by volunteers under intensive supervision following a set procedure.

In her other race - the giant slalom - she placed tenth in the women's sitting group with a total running time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian first-place Claudia Lössch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungarian ninth-place Giongy Dani.
Four skaters on the disabled team failed to finish their laps, and 45 of the 117 skaters in the giant slalom failed to place in the race.
Police recovered a gift with a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
"We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop", said Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya.
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambhu Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chief of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were presented in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit me, none of them were injured.
But the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where I crashed was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of a red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
She has since been charged in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh with the murder of her son.
She is currently in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be considered suspect since her photograph was widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have considered that publication of the images could constitute bias.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are certainly going in dangerous directions if they publish photos or problems that are of suspects".
The Crown Office responsible for public prosecutions advised the press that there would be no further comment until at least after the indictment.
The document refers, according to the leak, to a border dispute, claimed by Palestine based on the pre-1967 war borders of the Middle East.
Other topics that were reported to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered an important issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a ten-year military presence in the Golan, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a five-year one.
The guards had to closely supervise the shooters through a supplemental pest control experiment, and the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were selected under the Association's Hunting Scheme.
According to Mick Ahlin, acting director of the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt received extensive safety training and exercises.
A new provisional nine-member electoral council was sworn in by Martelly yesterday.
This is the fifth by-election for Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-establishment demonstrations that began in October.
Demonstrations, sometimes violent, broke out over the failure to hold elections proposed for 2011.
About 60 incidents of iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and injuring four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) states it is aware of 27 incidents involving hardware.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had notified it of an additional 34 incidents of malfunctions, which the company termed "non-serious".
The Ministry responded to Apple's call to postpone the report by saying it was "deeply regrettable".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 am local time (Friday 09:19 pm GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reports that there are no indications of a tsunami wave.
A Filipino policeman has taken two Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M-16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and a young man, as well as the Filipino photographers, were quickly released.
Then the photographers took the place of an old lady because she wanted to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Leggens followed in his father's footsteps and took up medicine as a profession.
He trained as a doctor of obstetrics and was appointed to the staff of the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Leggins began his research into preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His research shows that giving a certain hormone accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the flight recorder, or " black box ", on Wednesday.
He has also received praise from colleagues.
"Luna was the first extreme queen", said Tommy Dreamer. "My first boss, Luna, died on New Moon night. She was a strong woman, a one-of-a-kind".
Dustin " The Gilded One " Runnels commented: "She was as eccentric as I am... and more capable than I am... I love her and I miss her... I wish she was in a better place".
In a poll of 1,400 people taken before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree with this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Concerning the other side of the poll, 29% of those polled think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never be a republic.
The physical fitness of the Olympic gold medallist became questionable due to his complaint, as he was supposed to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the 3-metre event at the Commonwealth Games.
He cannot take the medication he needs for the pain because it is forbidden in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime ever known on January 25.
Several people checked the discovery using different devices and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets formed, and in particular how the Earth formed from cometary impacts in the distant past.
Comey, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political chatter and nonsense".
He is likely to run for president in 2016.
Neoxygen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-linked technology in contrast to older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There is no additional transport and no underground trains will stop at Wembley, as well as no car parking and no facilities for parking and boarding.
Concerns over transportation shortages raised the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of the team's fans.
I cited a study published on Thursday in the journal Science about the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although this process was thought to take much longer in hobbyists - due to cross-breeding between a domesticated Darwin's finch, a medium-sized ground-flying finch, a migratory finch, and a sharpnose finch.
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can also be rolled into small cubes.
It can also be pulled as a thin wire that can be rolled and twisted. It can also be struck or rolled into sheets.
It could be very thin, and stuck onto another metal. It could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "luminous manuscripts".
It is called the pH number of the chemical, and you can make an indication of this number by using red cabbage juice.
The color of maple juice changes depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic.
The level of hydrogen ions is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical that is being tested.
Hydrogen ions are de-electronised protons (as hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
We have to roll the dry powder together and then squeeze it into a ball with wet, clean hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a sort of covering.
There were in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro a toilet with a flush toilet in almost every house and connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in Minoan Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China as well. In Roman civilization, the toilets were often part of the public baths so that men and women could enter them together in the common areas.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The space satellite receives and reflects the call almost instantly.
A satellite is launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere obscures some of the light and visibility.
We need a giant rocket over 100 feet (30 m) high to launch a satellite or a space telescope.
The wheel has changed the shape of the world in remarkable ways; but his most important contribution to us has been to provide a faster and easier means of transport.
It was he who invented the train, the automobile, and many other modes of transportation.
In the lower classes are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits, sheep, and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including the house cat) eat smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, the special function of each to prevent it from competing with others.
Black cats are more social and live in large groups called packs.
A lions family consists of one to three adult males, plus about 35 females and cubs.
The females are usually closer together, as they are a larger family of brothers and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly animals similar to lions (but not other big cats) are very aggressive and deadly to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (though not perfectly) and swim and leap long distances and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus) as the cat, the lion, the leopard, and the tiger. These four are the only ones that can reproduce.
A tiger's roar is not the same as a lion's roar in full voice, but it is closer to a yell in angry words.
The pygmy leopard prefers to eat smaller animals, and will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the pygmy leopard hunts are smaller in size.
Scientists believe that the pygmy leopard tracks and identifies prey by its sense of smell; it can sense their location on the ground.
It can see well in the dark with night vision, and moves very slowly. The pygmy leopard hunts its prey by camouflaging its surroundings and then attacking it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main group of population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island from which it can never easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment from its previous environment.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group will need different characteristics or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than before.
The Aboriginal peoples have not been altered in any way, because they still need the same adaptations as we have.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, their similarity to other populations gradually diminishes.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will have diverged to the point that they cannot be called a single species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.The emergence of a species is seen as a necessary consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. Shade is provided.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its age, so it was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
It had long jaws with over 70 claw-like teeth plus a second set at the top of its mouth, meaning that nothing could escape its path.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had a compound tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish and other crustaceans, and it was probably carnivorous.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could match it.
Although most of their food is not unfamiliar to us, the Romans had their share of exotic or unusual meals for the occasion, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a louse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals seated at the tables, the rich men liked to kneel together and recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have incorporated the foods brought to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao and no ancient Romans ate turkey (the mosaic).
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods and it was considered the house of the god.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the gods during festivals and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard that leads to a secure room that can only be entered by the priests.
Sometimes unique pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the gods.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, home was not of great importance.
Most Arab family life was outdoors.
The women cooked in the square; the shops were just open-air museums overlooking the street. The stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was expensive.
Greenland has been inhabited by humans sporadically. According to Norse epic tales, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and whoever traveled westward reached Greenland and called it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there previously.
There were also significant differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, though all are Nordic countries.
If you've ever seen the film National Treasure, you've probably noticed that the treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even though it's on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is shown below the document, in italics.
Although the author of this fragment is not precisely known, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 293⁄4 inches (75.5 cm) x 241⁄2 inches (62.2 cm) was folded and shelved early in its existence.
So, the code was probably just added as a label.
The landings on that fateful day and the battles that followed led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was never liberated.
France was ruled by the Vichy, a class of Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies occupied southern France, calling the invasion "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French troops had liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work together as a community.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, also reflected in the social hierarchy.
Autonomous cities are the ancestors of nations. Urban culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, the preservation of cultural traces and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Micro-cultures often disappear without leaving any real historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the first 13 states formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - that remained the basis of the federal system.
Congress lacked any power to tax, and, lacking a national executive or judicial branch, relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, it has no authority to override interstate tax laws and customs.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all the States before they could be amended and the States mocked the central government to the point that most of their representatives were absent.
The Italy national football team, nicknamed the Germany national football team, is the second most successful football team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, wrestling, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands it occupies, Japan is often referred to - from a geographical perspective - as an "archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century and records of European sailors passing by the island name lha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change native grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers to work the sugarcane and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and Taiwan was made a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main buildings, the Intihuana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered and restoration work continues today.
For example, the world-famous 35 mm still photograph format, the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
Its production continues to this day, but most importantly the image sensor body of digital cameras inherited its aspect ratio.
The 35 mm model is actually, slightly confusingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this figure is (when divided by 12 to get the ratio of the smallest integer) therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the Advanced Photo System family of formats) have a width-to-height ratio equal to or nearly this.
The oft-misused and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while preserving some semblance of order.
Perhaps the most striking feature of the central theme is the intersection of the lines that bisect the image vertically and horizontally (see illustration).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound the countries of Europe together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The overwhelming power he wielded affected everyone from the king to the common people.
A core Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's cash resources are meant primarily for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the Church of Rome had the central authority, and this focus on power and money led many to question whether the requirements of the creed were being met.
Britain quickly began to blockade Germany by sea after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified and coordinated by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain blocked international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire stretches of ocean, and this presented even neutral ships with a threat.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its own unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's phases or each dynasty had a different kind of power.
In addition, Akko was among several dynasties that ruled in a period of instability in the divided provinces. The most notable of these periods was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period a fierce war broke out between several nobles who wanted to take the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest positions in the Great Hall of the People.
I am fascinated by the social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to the ruler alone.
And after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on class, military ranks have become more based on criteria.
The French Revolution also inspired other oppressed working-class youths in other countries to unleash their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave known as the Hara on the mountain of En-noor for meditation.
The same zeal, which has endured through the ages, offers a very vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to catch it even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, you become completely isolated.
You can see nothing but a beautiful clear sky above the many mountains that surround the place. And you can see and hear very little of this world inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several monumental pyramids built to honour the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "City of the Burial" of Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), miniature tombs, temples, and a mausoleum.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honour Khufu's wives and family members.
An "up" voltage will look like a V and a "down" voltage will look like a capsule or a square with a lower rim.
A high sign indicates that you should start at the edge and push the arrow, while a low sign indicates that you should start at the end of the arrow (where your hand holds the arrow) and pull it down.
The upper arch usually gives a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and more harsh.
Feel free to draw your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed curves are there for a reason, so you should always respect them.
Frightened, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (Mary Therese aged 11 and Louis Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris by carriage and were greeted by a large crowd shouting and booing against the King and Queen.
A mob was able to force the King and Queen to open their car windows wide.
A mobster once brandished the head of one of the Royal Guards killed in Versailles in front of a horrified queen.
The Filipino people have borne the brunt of the United States of America's imperialist war in the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extra profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will form the core profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the organization was founded.
The era these events took place in is known as the High Middle Ages and is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which in their entirety ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the drive for technology or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is tied to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Two general ideas are shared by most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path of least cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on communities of which it is a part, rather than being associated with such a society.
For example, one might say that the automobile engine necessarily led to the development of the road.
However, establishing a nationwide road network is considered economically viable because of the limited number of cars, so new roads are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of automobiles also causes a high rate of road accidents, which leads to the development of new health care technologies to treat the affected bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from such writers as Goethe, Weisch and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture associated with this geography, and these, as the horizons and places of society, were superior to arbitrary imposed rules.
While Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were of higher value than those offered by the Byzantine bazaars.
At this time Paris was nicknamed the Capital of Romance instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, patterns in the West lag behind by about 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the time was the introduction of the knot for tying clothes, as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming - often organic - is a simple system that uses stored seeds that are adapted to the ecosystem of the area, as well as crop rotation techniques or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Most farmers have historically worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures reconcile like-minded individuals who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, race, class, location and/or gender of members.
The traits that define a subculture's identity may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership by a distinctive and traditional use of style that includes clothing, craft, and embroidery.
Among the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by citing a few unfortunate cases of children who suffered, through neglect, bad luck or intentional abuse, social disconnection from adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "wild" or "savages". Some lost children are locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment was due to the parents' refusal to treat the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have been abused as children or severely traumatized before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are said to have been domesticated by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that are very similar to those of a pet, such as fear of humans or apathy.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further than that.
The interactive learning process is not a method of learning but rather a tool that provides support for individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of interactive learning, and so is a Microsoft Office Clipboard.
Interactive learning is supported by the software internally and aims to ask questions, motivate and explain actions that would be difficult for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not based on nurturing, caring and education, but these children will become them.
We know that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
The substitute carer must provide all the essentials that were missing in the previously evacuated homes.
The Internet combines public and private elements of communication.
The peculiarities of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and modes of content.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eime and McCord (1998) who studied audience reaction to websites".
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the field of the interpretation of microfacial expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether someone is lying by interpreting the exact expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks noted in his paper that the President's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
It is hypothesized that these abilities to analyze human behavior are shared by some animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research identified two groups of Chinese varieties: the subtle group and the visible group.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the assemblage of expressional variations.
The process of separation and recombination causes the difference to randomly go back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have difficulty meeting their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure to do so will lead to serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The most abundant plant resources were proteins that could be obtained from the leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digestible, but are high in protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some way similar to how chimpanzees survived in the savanna.
Hypnosia is the deliberate awakening during your normal sleep period and sleeping much later (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock so that you can regain consciousness without being fully awakened.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock while you sleep, you should leave it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other options, based on biosystems, include drinking a small amount of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get out of bed and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress on his body and soul.
The less stress we have, the more positive our life force gives us. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but developed through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yuga. Through visualizing the various deities, energy channels are cleansed, shukra is activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, and this led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, but by the end of the war, clashes of regimes, procedures, and cultures led to conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was to last for the next forty years, being fought on the ground, by proxy armies, in theatres of war from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight, as over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered the formation of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure the ability of your country to transport its own people and goods, and at the same time, to intercept the ability of your enemy to transport their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic Campaign of the Second World War, in which the Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean in aid of the British.
At the same time, the German Navy was attempting to counter this invasion with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have been as likely to invade Britain as it was to invade the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes seem to have bred them because of the ease of access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
The dairy goats were reared in herds grazing on hillsides or secondary pastureland, often tended by goatherds who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known pastoralists.These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagon roads were developed in England from the 16th century.
Although the early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to greater speeds and to pull greater loads than on the roads which were considered too rough at the time.
Train tracks were invented relatively early on to secure tracks, but it was later found that putting a rail over the tracks made them more efficient.
This was detected, but the iron caused further corrosion to the car's wooden tires.
Eventually, wooden tires were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first complete iron bars were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation; humans first began walking upright about two million years ago, coinciding with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in a stable manner.
Two-legged species were found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 Ma, although coelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is just like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we want to find a temporary solution, we must get to the root of the problem, and we must solve it.
The world has clearly changed dramatically due to mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have become more acute due to human overpopulation and the increasingly luxurious lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent a few blocks away from John Dunlap's printing press, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary of the Treasury Charles Thompson.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap Cash Notes".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall Square on July 8th.
He delivered a copy to George Washington on July 6, and read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The Dunlap Twenty-five Fold is the earliest surviving copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten copy has been lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and have survived to the present day. They are called birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
I just love stuff about birds that looks like dinosaurs.
It had two legs with outer shells and claws, and was egg-shaped, and walked on its hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary digits.
A binary digit value can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits - or bits, if we use the terminology of computer language.
Symptoms of internal embolism may not be immediately apparent. A diagnosis cannot be made immediately with symptoms such as vomiting, which is common enough.
A poisoned medicine or household chemical can be found in an open container, which is probably the best indicator of internal poisoning.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
Entomologists use the term "bugs" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient knowledge of the bed bug, which is an insect highly adapted to infest humans.
Both killer whales and bighorn whales are characterized by a long period of incubation, and adapt to living in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely as males to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or that of their child to raise a child.
It is likely that these couples will choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, the original parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other spouse can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
It is not, however, unique to the field; rather, conducting experiments is a test that can be used to disprove one or more potential hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also inform scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
While knowledge declined with the Greeks, the West itself remained isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the physiologically observed rhythms and behaviors in critically endangered species rely on the existence of self-circuits and are produced by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclic signals, have been documented for most organisms, including the cyclic rhythms of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are oscillators that will persist for periods of cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first major attempts to prove that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses or parasites to introduce their DNA into the bacteria.
Two experiments were conducted to label either the DNA of the reactants using radioactive phosphorus or their proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are from stem cell lineages.
Mutations can only be transmitted in germline cells to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be to visit, photograph and learn about the Bornean orangutans.
People leave small towns by car every morning to go to work and are met on the way by people who work in the area they have just visited.
This dynamic transportation system supports everyone and is somewhat related to the transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this carbon-based mega-economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that underpinned human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation. Everyone complains about transportation.
You rarely hear in developed countries about similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down.
Why do these complaints about transport systems occur, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the flow of traffic and personal vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic studies are difficult because you cannot predict the behavior of a driver one hundred percent.
Fortunately, markets tend to behave in a reasonable order; therefore, traffic has a reasonable order, which can be expressed mathematically approximately.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings back in proportion to their body length.
This gives it a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are the dragonfly and the Mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people found his claim to be true but a significant number believed otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the ground moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching 6 miles (9.6 km) wide.
20% of the water that the world's rivers discharge into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or architectural excellence.
The ancient Egyptians admired the modern kingdom for the relics of their ancestors, which date back over a thousand years.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most state functionaries, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
The existence of the basic chemical elements gold, silver and copper has been known since antiquity, and all of these elements can be found in nature in their original form and can be extracted in a relatively simple way using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything was composed of a combination of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This was analogous to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although it also implied that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold as well.
You can also get alloys that contain trace amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. And all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into a dot at the end of this sentence.
And then, the pencil was a good friend of many hobbyists who appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the pencil has been relegated to less prominence and use.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, without having to use a clipboard.
One can't help but wonder what will become of the keyboard when a newer invention emerges.
The basis of the fission bomb is that it accumulates energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. The core bursts open again and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to decay with little or no movement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the shell is about 70 kilometres on the near side and 100 kilometres on the far side.
It is thinner under Maria and thicker under the hills.
There may have been a lunar seamount on the near side because the crust is less thick. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are more about finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that automatically manifest themselves as they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want the things they value and what things in their environment make them or not worth certain things.
The two most well-known theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's second factor theory.
In general, two types of behavior may be exhibited by those who seek to be ruled by their former peers: one is attempting to be "like the others" (or others).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary action, performance appraisals, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, the individual becomes a second person who feels obliged to change everything the team has valued and owned.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often results in friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical colleagues.
They often have more autonomy than members of traditional teams because their teams may be convened according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local administration.
The existence of a real "stealth team" has been described by Larson and LaFausto, 1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the Invisible Team management team. The Invisible Team maintains the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to establish an educational organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the goals of implementing corporate learning concepts.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
As a result, collaboration within an organization to overcome barriers can result in new innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization is able to innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
(Angel (2006), defines sustainability as a methodology used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The data associated with neuroscience provide concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to knowledge inquiry. This serves to narrow the area of research and make it more focused on the hobby.
The link between brain and behavioural pathology is supported by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies is allowing us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in ways we never could before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for constructing simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence involves making machines to automate all tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and table preparation, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are used today in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been used to build many software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Sometimes a teacher will take her students to places where they would not otherwise be able to go by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field visits. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a nice way to revisit a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennett School of North Carolina design a website each year that describes their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned annually, but old versions are kept online to serve as a record.
Forums can also help students improve their writing. For those students who have experienced forums with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience can generally change that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, a writer on the forum tends to write better to avoid criticism.
Forums also "force students to become more intelligent about the world around them".[citation needed] The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Writing in forums is a collaborative tool that inspires and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of forums can "also enable students to become more analytical and critical; and by responding effectively to online material, students can identify their own positions in the context of others' writing as well as their own opinions on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and is home to a collection of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is to the far south, and to the north is the beautiful, untapped nature reserve of Muscat and beyond.
All of these things make Ontario look more prominent than it does to outsiders who consider it to be of Canadian essence.
The larger areas in the north are sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited.
In a demographic comparison that surprises many: the African American population residing in the United States is more numerous than the Canadian population.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and is a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent countries, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread widely in the Leeward Islands and Maui.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama establishing the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the African coast, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Females: it is better for females to be declared married, regardless of actual social status.
And it is advisable to wear a bra (but not the kind that looks too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as harassment or unfamiliarity, such as being watched, being held, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences don't make that acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids used modern Casablanca as a strategic port named "Nava" after its foundation by Berber hunters in the 10th century BC.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese as Casa Branca, and abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar-ul-Badîah, and Spanish traders named it Casablanca and established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least expensive places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods throughout the Old City, such as chicken, pottery, leather goods, rhubarb and all kinds of cheap products, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , located in the far east near Rwanda .
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo which covered most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, before making any visits outside Goma, it is important to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is the base for the climb of Mount Nyiragongo and one of the cheapest ways to follow mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can ride a Buda Buda (a type of motorcycle used as a taxi) to get around Goma, and the usual fare (local) is around 500 CFA francs for a short trip.
In addition to being relatively inaccessible, Timbuktu came to be used as a gateway to distant foreign lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is considered a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and its airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the stations featured in Henry Louis Gates' PBS series The Wonders of the African World.
The city differs markedly from the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa, and is the main park of the South African National Parks.
There is a daily maintenance fee and an entrance fee, as in all South African national parks.
It may be worthwhile to buy a Wild Card, as it gives you access to a select group of South African parks or to all the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is where many tourists consider their first stop.
The row of buildings that line Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glittering skyline that overlooks the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong , leave the island and head for the Kowloon Waterfront in the opposite direction.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated heavily on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is where the British colonists used to have their private quarters, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of coastal mangroves in the world, extending for 80 kilometres (50 mi) through remote areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located within the Indian Territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last evidence of the dense forests that once covered the Ganges valley.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres, of which about a third is covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are as many as 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 packs of deer in the region.
Buses depart from the Inter-District (Across-the-River) terminal during the day, although most buses, especially those bound for the east and Jakar/Pomthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-city buses are very frequent, it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable and powerful Japanese coaches.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Barrow (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Ouyapouk River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Ouyapouk River and connects the city of Ouyapouk, Brazil, with Saint-Georges-du-Ouyapouk, French Guiana.
The towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the length of 378 meters, with two sides of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance inside the bridge is 15 metres . Construction was completed in 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017 .
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, in time for the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay.Members of the Guarani group lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", arose as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in January, at the Polo Place Canitas.
Besides that, smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Argentine Polo Association .
The official currency of Falkland is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the Pound Sterling (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank in the islands that sells through Stanley instead of FIC West .
Pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often used.
In outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; please check with the owners to see which payment methods are accepted.
It is virtually impossible to exchange Falkland's currency outside the islands, so you must exchange money before visiting the islands.
As Montevideo is located just south of the equator, summer overlaps with winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo tends to be subtropical; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Frost can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but air and moisture combine to make the atmosphere colder than the thermometer readings.
The amount of rainfall is almost constant throughout the year, and there are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although some of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals remain wild and will eventually be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should keep at least 100 yards (91 m) away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (23 m) away from all other wild animals!
No matter how tame they appear, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they are not kept at a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and dangerous, and we must give them their own space.
Also, be careful because the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so try not to bring or cook smelly food and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by Mao's movement, a peaceful demonstration in the town resulted in the death of Supreme Leader Tupou Thouassou-Lilouvi III.
Because Auckland is sandwiched between two harbours, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore (North Harbor District) beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy allowing for safe swimming, and most are shaded by coconut trees.
Tamaki Road Beach is located on Whitimata Harbour, on the outskirts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are crowded with bars and a good selection of shops lining the beach. It is safe to swim.
The main beer is known as "Number One", which is not a complex beverage, but rather a pleasant and refreshing one. Another local beer is called "Manta".
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more common.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it is easy to get mineral water if you are nervous.
To Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is considered exotic. A small black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino has a layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent although expensive.
Excursions to the reef are popular all year round, and reef injuries are rare for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities and pay attention to all signs and safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is most abundant near beaches and estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. It can sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean; their main habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A traveler who makes a reservation in advance is assured of having a place to stay as soon as he reaches his destination.
Although you will see that it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals on certain hotels.
Travel agents have traditionally offered packages including a pickup, transportation to and from the airport or even bundles including flights and hotels.
They may hold your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or complete other formalities for your travel destination (for example, a visa).
However, any adjustments or requests must be made through the travel agent first and then directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of festival goers choose to camp on site as an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you have to go inside before you can get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stage may have ended, several sections of the festival continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are travelling in the northern Baltic Sea region in the evening, you should check the cab position, as the passage through the ice causes excessive noise in the most affected cabs.
The Saint Petersburg cruise includes time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos often make an effort to keep guests in for longer and to spend more money. They often have no windows or clocks, and sometimes it is difficult to get people to leave.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment, to keep guests happy and to keep them entertained.
Some establishments will serve alcohol for free, but the sugar interferes with good judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of keeping a clean mind.
Anyone driving in high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as well as on soft ground.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall to impede your progress in a very short time.
It can be caused by snowfall, hailstorms, condensation, or ice on the windows of cars with limited visibility.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic flows almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the most popular with visitors.
The term safari tour is commonly used to refer to traveling across the country to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars and standard equipment can give a good view.
Lions, elephants and tigers are sometimes shy and can be seen better with binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "jungle walk", "jungle walk", or "jungle walk") is a long-distance walk, lasting from an hour to several days.
The Paralympics will run from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
After Tokyo hosted the 1964 Olympics, it became the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may run into trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will no longer apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will be priced between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen while the standard fare will be around 7,000 yen.
It helps to dry wet clothes. Many hotels offer a laundry room service so you can borrow it, even if it is not in the room.
If you are not comfortable, or you do not like to wear socks, you can try using an air dryer, if available.
Do not let the cloth get too hot (it may shrink or stick in the worst case).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to let the water run for a minute, in others you have to let it run for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness. If you have any concerns, consider buying bottled mineral water that is bottled properly and from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unheard of in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully infect or kill people, are called pests.
Shopping in the free market is an opportunity to buy goods duty-free in designated places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can, at times, save a considerable amount of money, especially money spent on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont contains the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, and passes regularly through isolated forested terrain.
If you are used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are always steep inclines, narrow passages and sharp curves.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence is very important.
Surprisingly, mobile network coverage is better here than in many other areas along the route, such as the Pennsylvania woods.
German pastry is very good, and in the province of Bavaria it is very rich and varied, much like the pastry of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are very popular and apples are cooked in pies all year round while cherries and raisins are grown in summer .
Many German pastries contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. A popular cake is often eaten specially with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small, rich pastry, try the Berliner, the Vancouver or the Krapf, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of spices and herbs with meat or vegetables.
Curry spices can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, curry milk is more common, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is more common.
