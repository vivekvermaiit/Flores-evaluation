This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the animal's wings were brown on top with a light or carrot color on the underside.
The find also provides information on the evolution of wing in birds.
Because dinosaur wings lack a fully developed shaft, called a spine, but have other features of the wings - nests and tails - researchers concluded that the spine was likely a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display, and scientists argue that although this is a tail from a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult feathers rather than juvenile feathers.
The researchers say that although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the specimen suggests adult plumage, not that of a newborn.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

They discovered that the Sun operated on the same basic principles that other stars were based on: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system was guided by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are calculated together to define a star's Rosby number, which is related to the flow of the plasma.
The star is so inactive in terms of magnetic reversals, the smaller the Rosby number.

The part of the project that was completed was mainly theoretical, however the program was designed to represent observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
What the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's.
Similar to the moon's gravitational pull on the earth, creating tides, the Milky Way exerts gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter found in a galaxy is located around the galaxy, forming a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered XDR-TB in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview he had given, he said that the new mutation "caused great concern because of its high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have been infected with the virus at the hospital and at least two of them were health care professionals at the hospital.

In France, elections have always been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a curtain and put in an envelope a pre-printed piece of paper with the name of the candidate of their choice.
After the clerks verify the voter's identity, he drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly codified by the French electoral law.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process, and in the late afternoon, votes are counted by volunteers, under strict supervision, who follow specific procedures.

Four skiers from the women's sitting ski category were unable to complete their routes, while 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Sekar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road to the accident was temporarily closed as emergency services were pulling the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then went to Addenbrooke's in Cambridge.
Antecua has since been charged by the High Court of Edinburgh with the murder of her son.
She's in custody with an indictment and a trial pending, but any eyewitness evidence may have been compromised as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have ruled that the publication of photos is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee reports that journalists seem to be standing on a tightrope if they publish photos etc. of suspects.
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has informed reporters that there will be no further comment at least until charges are laid.
According to leaked information, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the Middle East war that was fought in 1967.
Reportedly, among other topics covered were the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy place for both states, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the complementary pest control trial would be under close supervision by the rangers as the trial would be monitored and its effectiveness judged.
In cooperation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Scout Association of Australia (NSW), special volunteers were recruited as part of the Scout Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, General Manager of Conservation and Heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Yesterday Martelli was sworn in to a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC).
This is the fifth interim election board for Martelli in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed the previous resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-representative protests that began in October.
Some violent protests were due to the non-holding of elections, some pending since 2011.
Based on official reports, there were about 60 cases of iPod malfunction that resulted in high temperature, starting six fires and leaving four people with minor injuries from the fire.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling it "really sorry" that Apple's report had been delayed.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m.
The Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage on their territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino ex-police officer took Hong Kong visitors hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, his country's capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six of the hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early; so were the photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
She trained and became a gynaecologist, starting work in 1959 at the State Female Clinic, Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins, in his spare time, began researching premature birth.
According to his research, if a hormone was given, the fetal lung would mature.
Xinhua said government investigators on Wednesday located two black box flight data recorders.
The fellow fighters paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first winner of the Queen of Extreme competition. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Unique as herself. Powerful woman".
Dustin Goldstein Runnels commented that Luna was as weird as I am... maybe more so... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who took part in the poll ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a crownless republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agreed with this idea, because they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
On both ends of the poll, 29% of all respondents believe Australia should become a republic without a monarchy as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic without a monarchy.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three swimming events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his discomfort his fitness is in question.
She couldn't take the medication she needed to stop the pain because it's banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest prime number ever found.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water transport to earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, who is 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration claims that the new generation air transport system would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite-based as opposed to older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate an aircraft and give more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is taking place and the underground railways will not stop at Wembley. Car parking spaces and parking and transshipment infrastructure are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raise the possibility that the match will be held behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study reported Thursday in Science spoke of the existence of a new type of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process is thought to have taken much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's spider of the genus Geospiza fortes and the migratory spider of the genus Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be carved into all shapes, shaped into shapes of the smallest size.
It can be carved into thin wire, then bent and braided, forged or rolled into sheets.
It can become very thin and stick to other metals, and it can become so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in handmade book images called illustrated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make a gauge using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that no longer have their electrons (as a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Rotate the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in your palms will react with the outer shells, which will create a strange sensation and form something like a peel.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a toilet with a faucet for each dwelling, connected to an elaborate sewer system.
Also, in Greece, in the dwellings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, ruins of sewer systems have been found.
Toilets also appeared in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets in Rome were often part of public baths, where all of the sexes formed a mixed crowd.
When you call someone who's far away, it uses a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back to earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists have space telescopes because our planet's atmosphere is altering our light and our visibility.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The contribution of the wheel to the world is amazing, but the most important of all is that it is the easiest and fastest way to get around.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are cats of more medium size that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many predatory felines (including the free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on the many bugs, rodents, sauropods, and birds.
The secret of their success is the idea of position, a special role each cat has, which prevents competition between them.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called herds.
Herds consist of one to three adult males that mate with each other along with up to thirty females with their young.
Females usually have a close bond with each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act much like wolf or dog packs, animals that are strikingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and are also extremely deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a complete athlete, can climb (not at a very good level), swim, make huge leaps, and put five times as much force into lifting as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same category (genus Pantheri) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but it is more like a phrase than angry, loud words.
The oseloth prefers small animals, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and even birds, almost all the animals the oseloth hunts are smaller than the oseloth.
Scientists believe that oselots track and find animals to feed (hunt) on through scent, sniffing the ground to see where they are.
They see very well in the dark through night vision and move silently, but oselots hunt their prey by adapting to their environment and then suddenly attacking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often encounter a different environment than in the past.
This new environment has new resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was required in the past.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, the same adaptations need to be made as in the past.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the similarity to the rest of the population becomes smaller and smaller.
At some point, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called "idogenesis", which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants create their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our homes and our clothes are made from plants, the food we eat is mostly plants, and without plants, animal survival would be impossible.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth combined with an extra row of teeth at the top of its mouth, indicating that there is no escape for anything that comes its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water, and even the giant dinosaur Tyrannosaurus would not have been able to compete with it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had a variety of strange or unusual festive dishes, including the following, wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a glider.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, while the rich men preferred to eat at banquets where they could relax on their side while dining.
Meals in ancient Rome could not have contained foods that reached Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, there was no corn, tomato, potato, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primordial temple that was considered the home of the god.
The people would sacrifice to the deities, and the clergy would try to meet the deities' desires by organizing rituals and celebrations.
In each temple there is an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests have access.
Sometimes they built certain towers in a pyramidal shape called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the roof was not so important.
The Jewish family spent most of its life in the countryside.
Women cooked in the courtyard while shops were open stalls facing the street.
The land of Canaan lacked large tracts of forest, so timber was very expensive.
The Norse saga relates that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, as he traveled westward, found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, despite its discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you've seen the movie In Search of Lost Treasure, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is written some sort of treasure map.
Although there is a writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written the following: "Original Declaration of Independence issued July 4, 1776". This is written below, in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning the large parchment document (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the note may have been added merely as a flag.
The Normandy landings and the battles that followed liberated the French North, but the South was still not free.
It was run by the Vichy government, which consisted of Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; this raid was called Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and Germany was next.
Culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this in turn describes the size of society.
Cities-states are the ancestors of states. A cultural culture involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, in a continuous cultural imprint and a sublime dissemination.
Often, smaller civilizations disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as normal civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government - with Congress being the sole constituent - based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and because there was no executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were not cooperative, to enforce all laws.
Moreover, he had no authority to override the laws on taxation and customs duties between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, yet the states took the government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Nordic countries, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic Games events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island on the planet!
Because of the island group that Japan has, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
The origin of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and began a transformation in the practices by which native grain was produced, employing Chinese workers in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated western and northern Taiwan, making it an administrative province of their empire in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1985), the Qing Dynasty then concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where Taiwan passed into Japanese hands until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intiwatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been built from scratch in order to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common form of still image photography worldwide is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but the most important thing is the aspect ratio that's inherited from the digital camera's image sensor shapes.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide, which is confusing, and 24mm high.
The ratio of dimensions of this device (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format class, for example) equal or closely approximate these aspect ratios.
The law of three, often abused and mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order up to a meter in an image.
It states that the most effective point for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, now rich and powerful, was brought under control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has created unbreakable bonds between the European states despite any differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to mere mortals.
One of Christianity's main beliefs is that wealth should be used to relieve the poor and suffering, and church funds are specifically raised for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to wonder whether the doctrine was being properly implemented.
Great Britain began to blockade Germany by sea, immediately after the beginning of the attacks.
The strategy has been effective, with cuts in vital military and civilian supplies, despite the blockade violating generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom has placed mines in international waters to block shipping in every part of the sea, threatening even neutral shipping.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected the same for its unchallenged submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
The nations, after seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of differentiating each distinct time period, each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a volatile era of divided provinces, the most famous of these being the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, as thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The social and political implications are many, and they include the use of the metric system, a shift from authoritarianism to democracy, patriotism and the belief that the country does not belong to one ruler, but to all the people.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were made accessible to all male job seekers, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the army, as instead of being ranked by rank, it was now ranked by size.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class individuals in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, where he survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual calling.
The cave is isolated from the world as it is located on the edge of a hill north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not at all easy for someone to find it even if they know it exists.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world is visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), a few small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Heopah, and many of the smaller pyramids, as well as the smaller tombs and temples, were built in honor of Heopah's wife and family members.
The sign indicating that the beam shall move upwards looks like a V and the sign indicating the movement downwards looks like a buckle wire or a square without its underside.
Playing up means that you have to start from the edge, pushing the bow, and playing down means that you have to start from the frog (the point where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
Playing the bowl upwards produces a softer sound, while playing it downwards is louder and more dynamic.
You are free to put your own markings, but keep in mind that the ones that do exist have a musical function, so they often need to be taken into account.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Maria Theresia and four-year-old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, who had been terrorized, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a person in the crowd began shaking the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles, right in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of the imperialist war of the United States for the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and the bond rate was manipulated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the surpluses that resulted from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were to be the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time when the events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1,000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which in terms of conditions ends around 1500.
Technological causation is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the promotion or enforcement of technology, to the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two central ideas: that technology development itself follows a course largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn 'influences' societies of an inherent character, rather than societies adapted to the present.
For example, one might argue that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed with the aim of reducing the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership regime also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which in turn lead to new methods in health care to repair bodily injuries.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, coming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic era, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultural elements related to this geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the position of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the source of style in the modern era, so Constantinople is the corresponding European source during the feudal era.
Its reputation as a center of plenty began to spread about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its prestige declined in the twelfth century, mainly because of the Crusaders who brought back materials such as silk and spices, which were of higher value than the products of Byzantium's markets.
It was then that the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
Early dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, the slow communication channels meant that there were 25 to 30 years of lag in technology in the West.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of the era, which came as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to fasten their clothes with buttons.
Maintenance farming is farming that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family alone.
Survival agriculture is a simple, usually biological system of using stored seeds from the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Traditionally, farmers have been largely self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized by social norms, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are divided by age, origin, social class, location and/or race.
The qualities of a subculture that make it distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
To mark their status, members of a subculture often adopt a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, special attitudes, and slang.
A key technique for meaningful socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate instances of children who, through neglect, bad luck or abuse, were not socialized with adults during their lifetime.
Some feral children have been isolated by humans, usually the parents themselves, in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to the rejection by the parents of the child due to the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children are likely to have experienced severe abuse or traumatic experiences before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are supposed to have lived alone in the wild.
A feral child, when raised entirely by animals without contact with humans, exhibits behaviors (within natural limits) that almost exactly resemble those of the particular animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, teaching aids go one step further.
The curriculum is not a way of learning but rather a helping hand to people undergoing a new teaching experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual and real curse words, in other words, the teacher is a form of curse word, but the same is true for the Microsoft Office Connector Man.
The virtual aids are embedded in software and are intended to ask, promote and explain processes that may have been too difficult for students to handle.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment without care, love and education, but it happens.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and affordable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that the child did not receive in the home from which he was removed.
The Internet includes elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet result in the existence of additional dimensions in the approach to uses and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuous relationships' were also identified as aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when researching audience reactions to websites.
Video has made important discoveries in understanding the tiny expressions, our infinitesimal expressions.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting the small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", states that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to discern sincerity accurately.
It is further thought that these abilities in understanding human behavior are exhibited in animals such as domestic dogs.
A twentieth-century study showed that there are two forms of genetic diversity, latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variants and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variants.
Distinguishing and blending redistributes the diversity between the two sides in each family.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so had serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be proteins that can attach to leaves and algae, but they're difficult to digest by primate mammals like us, unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only digestible but are also important sources of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all the evidence, it's not surprising that our ancestors faced the protein question the way chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process whereby you wake up consciously during your normal sleep period and fall back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock so that you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you catch yourself turning off the alarm clock while you are sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you will have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known to be diuretic) before bedtime to force the female to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of stress on his body and mind.
The less pressure, the better the life force is present, and each individual has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is the tension and negativity within each of us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded from the path of love of mahayana and from many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, at its core, is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini (enlightenment) energy is awakened by movements, inhalation and exhalation practices, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, systemic, process and cultural conflicts led to a rift between the two countries.
As two years had passed since the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and would have proxy wars at battle sites from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Poland's defenses had already been broken, and their only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian embankment.
However, these plans were no longer a benefit in almost an overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarus Front and the Ukraine Front, after invading the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large sections of the population and goods overseas.
The job of the seafarer has long been to ensure that your country can transport your own people and goods, while preventing your enemy from transporting theirs and theirs.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, in which the Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies failed, the Germans could in all likelihood conquer Britain as they did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes begin to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds roaming hills or other pastures, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, equivalent to the more widely known shepherds.
Wooden rails were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails were only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the carriages to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the less rugged roads of the day.
Wooden rack links appeared early enough and were intended to hold railway tracks in place, but it gradually became apparent that the tracks would be much more functional with an iron support on top.
This was a common method, but iron created more compression in the wheels of the wagons than wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron railway lines appeared.
The first known means of transportation was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is the custom.
Evidence of bipedal movement has been found in Australopithecine fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We have the ability to live a more sustainable life, to be part of the environmental movement, and maybe to take some activist action to somehow limit the problems of the future.
It's like treating symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary cure, we'll need to find the source of the issues and neutralize them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological achievements, and that problems have been increased by overpopulation and wasteful living.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten memo signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing plant.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies, now known as the Dunlap Brochures, were published.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the outdoor area of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9; another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that we know of are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one species of dinosaur has survived to the present day.
Many do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have wings and are able to fly.
But there are many things about birds that make them look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Computers are now based on the management of information encoded in binary form.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can only take one or two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general to make a direct diagnosis impossible.
The most obvious sign that someone has been poisoned internally is an open bottle of medicine or some toxic household chemical in the room.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term correa is officially used by ethymologists for this group of insects.
This term comes from the familiarity of the ancients with bedbugs, which were insects that were easily adapted to parasitize humans.
The insect killer and the bedbug are both colony-dwelling organisms, adapted to live in the nest or shell of their host.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological condition among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
Two partners may decide that raising an infant is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child they have.
These couples can plan an adoption for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The basic goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and this method essentially directs most scientific research.
But there is more to experimentation, and experimentation is a test that is conducted to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and observing also guide scientific inquiry.
Physicists and philosophers focused on classical texts, specifically the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on scientific matters, including psychology, were widely accepted.
As Greek intellectuals lost ground, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed that often the rhythms of physiology and behavior are dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, continuing their cyclic function indefinitely even when they have no external stimuli.
Hersey and Chase's experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase took phages, or microbes, to put their genetic material into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked either the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may produce a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the role of the part of the genetic material affected by the mutation is, and whether the cells affected are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to offspring, as mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who seek natural landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the wild flora and fauna of the area.
Examples of activities in a given location are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information related to the ecosystem.
For example, some visit, photograph, and learn about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and meet others whose work destination is the place the first ones just left.
In dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is connected to each other in some way and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Today, science shows that this huge carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of a steady state that has supported the evolution of the human species over the last two million years.
Every individual participates in society and uses some form of transportation system, and almost everyone expresses complaints about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard at the same level.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at play?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the traffic of specific drivers and cars between two places and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is not easy, as it is impossible to predict with complete confidence the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range of reasonable consistency; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic intensity, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships helped in the preparation, design and operation of road network installations.
The first animals to take off were insects, whose ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body backwards.
This provides them with a greater variety of small hiding places than predators.
Now, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and fireflies.
Many years ago, Aristarchus reported that the solar system rotated around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite, that the Solar System revolved around the Earth and the Sun (and even other stars).
It makes sense, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on the planet, carrying over eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles.
Twenty percent of the water that the Earth's rivers discharge into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon river is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size and technical perfection in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom era were impressed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also used in everyday life by most people working for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Man has known about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle held that all things are created by the combination of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
It looked mostly like the four forms of matter (in that order): solids, liquids, air, and plasma, although he also assumed that they were transformed into new substances to form this presence.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many chemical elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of very small particles, atoms.
The size of the atoms is so extremely small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil, when it appeared, became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pencil's place and usefulness have been degraded.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to touch a scissors.
One may wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy cart rolling up a hill, and then splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and this causes them to break apart if little or no pressure is applied.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 43 miles [70 km] thick on the near side and about 60 miles [100 km] on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the plateaus.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner, so the lava could better go to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people click or what attracts them.
These theories argue that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what is in their environment that will drive them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviours can occur when managers start mentoring their former peers: one end of the spectrum is to try to remain as 'one of the kids' (or one).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performing evaluations, assigning responsibilities and putting people before their responsibilities.
At the other end of the spectrum, you can turn into an unknown individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that the group has done and make it their own.
After all, the one ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure is the leader.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are created with the same excellence principles as conventional groups, however there are slight differences.
The virtual team members often act as a link to their immediate physical team.
Often, they are more autonomous than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be acceptable to their local administration.
The existence of a true 'invisible group' (Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p. 109) is another unique element of a virtual group.
Each person presents himself to the invisible management team, which sets the standards for all participants.
Why would an organisation want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing learning capabilities of the organisation? One of the goals for the practical application of the concepts of learning capabilities of the organisation is innovation.
Creativity and intelligence are fostered when all available resources in the functional parts of an organisation are used appropriately.
As a result, the process by which an organisation works together to overcome a barrier can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
To be able to innovate, management must create an environment for innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
The continuous learning approach is described by Engel (2006) as a method used to help organizations increase their level of performance.
Neurobiological evidence provides physical evidence for a theoretical study of the mind, so it narrows the scope of the research by making it more specific.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is a help to researchers and their study.
It's been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, injuries, injuries and tumors affect behavior and may cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that humans have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is largely science fiction, it is nevertheless an important branch of computer science that deals with the adaptation of behavior, learning and intelligence to a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, programming, responding to diagnoses and customer queries, but also handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and facial recognition.
These are now separate entities, focused on providing solutions to real problems of everyday life.
AI systems are now commonly used in the financial, healthcare, engineering, and military industries, and are even embedded in various home computer software applications and cyber games.
Excursions are an important part of any classroom, and very often a teacher would like to take his students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours, where students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while in class.
In essence, taking part in an excursion is also an important opportunity to reflect on the journey and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from North Carolina's Bennet School design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year it is updated, but the old versions are kept online and serve as a notebook.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing style. While students' experience of blogging often starts with poor grammar and spelling, audience presence generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author begins to work on improving his writing style to avoid criticism.
Also, participation in blogs 'forces students to become more understanding about the world around them'. The need to maintain the interest of the audience inspires students to become intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Managing a website is a technique that promotes teamwork and encourages students to learn more than what they are taught in school in the morning.
Proper use of blogs can encourage students to use more analytical and critical thinking, as through active response to online material, students can define their positions within the context of other people's texts, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it includes a wide range of galleries and museums that highlight old and modern Canada.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north lies the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and even beyond.
All of these and more characterize Ontario as the quintessential Canadian character as perceived by foreigners.
Large areas in the still northernmost part are quite sparsely populated, while some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is by itself a continent in terms of its wildlife species.
Almost all the islets are independent or of French origin, and they are famous for providing lush marine sanctuaries.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to the region and this spread largely as far as the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama traced the route around the Cape to Europe and India.
The place is enclosed to the north by the Sahel, while the Atlantic encloses it to the south and west side of the place.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should declare herself married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that different cultural habits can lead to acts that would be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to go behind them, hold their hand, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of a man, and do not be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids, who gave it the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and gave it the name of Daru I-Batija, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tadjis, pottery, leather goods, nargile and a wide range of trinkets, but they're all tourist.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a large tourist population in the eastern end near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma suffered devastation from the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, whose lava covered almost all the streets of the city, especially its center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking and observation programs in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. Usually the price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, "Tibet" has acquired the metaphorical meaning of exotic, distant country.
Today, Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because it is threatened by desert sand.
This is one of the most important stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special on the Wonders of the African World.
The city is completely different from the other cities in the country, as it has a predominantly Arab rather than African air.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northern and eastern part of South Africa and is located on the border line of Mozambique at the eastern point, Zimbabwe at the northern point, while its southern border is considered to be the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological areas, each supporting different species of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most notable attractions and is referred to as the emblem of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance entrance tickets to the park.
It may be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which grants entry either to selected South African parks or to all of its national parks.
Hong Kong Island is also the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is a magnet for many visitors.
The splendor of the buildings that form Hong Kong's urban panorama has been likened to a brilliant bar chart that is highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go across to the Kowloon Pier.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is mostly concentrated in high density in arid areas along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonialists occupied and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest zone in the world, extending 80 km into mainland Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that is on Indian soil is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, however, but include some of the last remnants of the magnificent jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres of which about one third is covered by water/oil zones.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumdang, depart between 06:30 and 7:30.
Because buses between the districts are usually full, it is suggested that you get a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are noted for their comfort and durability.
Public taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paros (150 knot) and Punaha (200 knot).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two hallways 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical gap under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] The bridge was completed in August 2011 and was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the territory now known as eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the dispute between the Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The period of colonization, which lasted three centuries, began with the Spanish.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The main tournament is held annually in the last month of the year at the Las Ca√±itas water polo pools.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and ticketing points for water polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Union.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP) whose value is equal to the value of the British Pound (GBP).
You can make a currency conversion at the only bank in the islands which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are usually accepted.
In remote islands credit cards will likely not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners beforehand to find out what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to convert Falkland currency outside the islands, so you do a currency conversion before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and in summer, temperatures above 30 ¬∞C are common.
The cold in winter is deceptive: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to create the feeling that it is colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human presence, their wild nature remains wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, keep at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wildlife!
As calm as bison may seem, Canada geese, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can nevertheless attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep proper distances, and these animals are big, wild, and can get dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850, and since 1959 it has been the official capital of Samoa.
The harbor was the site of a famous naval showdown in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamashese Lyalophy III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland has two harbours, the most popular being in this area.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches suitable for safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohuatokaua trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour of the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with families with a good variety of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is called Number One and is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
A wide variety of French wines are available for tasting, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be a better choice.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
In Australia the idea of flat white coffee is foreign. Short black is espresso, cappuccino is inflated with cream rather than foam, and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're amazing.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Nevertheless, you take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, the jellyfish have been appearing near beaches and river mouths from October to April, occasionally spotted at different times of the year.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of them and would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary natural habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance assures travelers that they will have a place to stay once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often make arrangements with specific hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through an agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, arrangements for airport transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
Your application may be put on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or to gather other documents for your trip (e.g. visa).
However, any amendments or requests should be referred to the travel agent first and not sent directly to the hotel.
As for some festivals, most music festival goers decide to camp there, and most consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you should start early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music may end in the main stages, there may be parts of the festival where the music will continue late into the night.
Some festivals provide special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of your cabin, as when the ship goes through ice it makes terrible noises for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city, and those on board do not need a visa (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a great effort to maximize the time and money spent by visitors, with windows and clocks missing and exits hard to find.
Often special offers of food, drink, and entertainment are made to keep customers in good spirits on the premises.
Alcoholic beverages are offered free of charge at various places, but drunkenness affects judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitude or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and very low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is not enough friction and it is difficult to drive on the bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, it can snow so much that you are trapped in a very short time.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow, moisture or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, where traffic continues for the most part without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a sight for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used as a land journey to visit the amazing African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars, and basic equipment will help with good visibility.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and can be best seen with binoculars.
A bush walk (also called a "hike safari") consists of hiking either for a few hours or for a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted them in 1964.
If you've arranged how you're going to fly and where you're going to stay for 2020 before the announcement that they're being postponed, you may be facing a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies are not extended to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for the events are expected to cost from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, while the price of standard tickets is about 7,000 yen.
Ironing can help with drying wet clothes, and many hotels have irons and irons available for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or you are not interested in wearing ironed socks, you can use a saddle if available.
Care should be taken not to allow the fabric to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas a minute of boiling water is enough, but in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider the possibility of buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter infectious animals that they are not accustomed to encountering in parts of their country.
Parasites spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, carry poison, and spread infections.
Infectious diseases or wild animals that have the ability to brutalize or kill humans are not often classified as harmful organisms.
Duty-free markets offer you the opportunity to buy goods in specific locations without being charged with customs duties and excise duties.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can save quite a bit of money at times, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is very dangerous to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway, because it crosses many lonely country places.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes peeled: roads with high gradients, narrow lanes and sharp turns are the norm.
The posted speed limits are clearly lower than on previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important to obey them strictly.
Yet, strangely enough, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than along other sections of the trail, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
Germany's sweets are of a high quality, while Bavaria's are as plentiful and varied as those of its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit desserts usually include apples, which are used to make desserts all year round, and cherries and plums, which appear in summer.
A large number of German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want but little tasty pastries, try those called berliner, fankuchen or krapfchen.
Curry is made up of spices and seasonings, and is accompanied by food of animal or plant origin.
Curry can be found "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the inland parts of northern India and Pakistan curries are mainly yogurt; in the south and other coastal parts of India, they are mainly coconut juice.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that includes a wide variety of cuisines from regions across the country.
But, when used without other designations, the term tends to denote food that comes from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now found throughout the archipelago, Javanese local cuisine offers a menu of lightly spiced dishes, with Javanese-preferred key flavours such as peanuts, chilli, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar) and many aromatic spices.
The suspension is used as a support for the rider's lower limbs and is held by the right and left sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, however they may present safety challenges due to the likelihood of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but his foot gets caught in the brake, the horse can drag him along the road as he runs.
First, most riders have special shoes that have heels, a soft, relatively small bottom.
Then, some of the saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a leather pusher to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by the rider at the time of falling.
Coatamo Valley - Chile's primary climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America with its variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
The peaks offer spectacular views from the hills, and climbers from all over the world are creating new routes along the endless walls.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves sliding down slopes covered in snow with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, often called ski bums, planning entire ski vacations at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old, cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to 5,000 B.C.
Skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was founded in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skiing: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, snowboarding or mountain skiing.
It is related to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but usually excludes them, as the latter are done on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar distance covered by hiking.
Ideally, you will be able to cover relatively greater distances than by walking - but you will very rarely develop the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on specially designed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, visiting many countries during the journey would require visa applications and multiple passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, could be said to function as a single country in this respect.
While staying in this zone you are generally allowed to cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen Member States, saving time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax authorities define antiques as goods over 100 years old.
The definition varies geographically, as the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important occupation for the Sami while the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who are engaged in other professions.
Even traditionally, of course, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but some made a living from fishing, hunting and so on, using reindeer mainly as pets.
Today many Sami work in modern trade, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of S√°mi.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Roma people, the word Gypsy is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccuracies about Roma.
If the country you are travelling to is subject to travel instructions, travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the guidelines of governments other than your own, even though their guidelines are designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
The guidelines are merely an overview of domestic policy developments.
The views presented are often concise, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a general term that includes any hazardous weather event with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather events can occur in all parts of the world and are classified according to geography, topography or atmospheric conditions.
Forms and effects of bad weather include strong winds, hail, torrential rain, and fires, as well as storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and cyclones.

Those planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
A search on the internet for "Hostile environments training course" will likely bring up the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually because of practical practice.
A class will usually last 2-5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with desert survival are common, but publications dealing with the war zone are few and far between.
Those who are travelling and planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
Governments' intention to issue passports without gender (X) or updated documents to correspond to the desired name and gender varies.
The desire of foreign governments to respect these documents is also changing considerably.
Security checkpoint investigations have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in pre-op can't expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Surface currents are the returning flows of waves that crash on the beach, often on a reef or something like that.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flows are concentrated in some deeper sections where strong currents may be generated at great depth.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
Once you're off-line, swimming to shore won't be any more difficult than normal.
You're trying to aim at a spot where you've never been trapped before or, based on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it might be preferable to wait for rescue.
The return shock begins before the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shortened), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have difficulty adjusting back to their native culture.
When you return to your country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your habits that belonged to the culture of your country.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country need time to adjust.
Many may not anticipate the patience and understanding needed by travelers to return home.
One of the activities held in the area that is of great interest to children is the pyramid light and sound show.
You can see the pyramids at night in silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and merchants, and the story of sound and light is just like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of a great story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many states and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island, which includes the district of Villa las Estrellas.
Others include the islands of Livingston and Deception where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula, which is surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula join at this point with the plateau, and then reappear to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or known as the Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountains, Mount Vinson, with the highest peak of Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (15,920 ft).
In remote areas where there is no telephone service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phone does not replace mobile phone in general, because you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational vessels, as well as for missions that use remote data and have voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly appealing to school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In several cases, enrolment in a gap-year course abroad can increase the chances of progressing to higher education in your home country.
Usually, tuition fees are required for enrollment in such educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating, and in the 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' you will find thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
The boat won't necessarily serve you in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the archipelago and the larger lakes are indeed big enough for any pleasure boat, the smaller boats or even kayaks provide an alternative experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand but is generally very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Almost all special cruises in the Baltic include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat in the evening.
If you disembark in the city only through excursions organized by the boat, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their advertising brochures. As shown in the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be considered a very frightening experience by people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and resentments about other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft operates and what happens in flight can help them overcome a fear of the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the rapid delivery of goods, and time is often a factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an emergency repair.
The larger companies have their own planes for some routes, but there are problems for other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent things by air freight, some flights may take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get through this faster would be to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where your role begins.
The obvious way to fly to first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privileged seat (or even better, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this comes at a cost: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no reason even to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a basic category of passengers who are willing to spend a lot of money for the privilege of a quick and comfortable transfer to their destination, and they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic democratic state which has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict resulted in the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been officially recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been resumed, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Formal announcements on the underground are made only in Catalan, but informal disturbances are announced by an automated machine that has a range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are notorious for their self-centeredness, rudeness, and arrogance.
Although often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to do well in Paris is to display your best behavior, as if you are a "bien √©lev√©".
The harshness of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show the elemental courtesy.
In the national park at Lake Plitvice there is a lush forest, with maples, reds and pines, while the flora is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkable diversity of plant communities due to different microclimates, soil diversity and altitude.

Endangered animals, such as the European bear, wolf, eagle, gull, lynx, wildcat, and wild rooster, are found in this place, as well as various common animals.
When visiting monasteries, women must dress in skirts that cover up to the knees and shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries have long skirts for women who have come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one of bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can borrow this from the pantry at the entrance, but this particular item of clothing is not washed after each use, and therefore you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (particularly pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa Ab Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and various side dishes such as cheese, tuna, etc.
The first letter in all nouns, as well as the word Sie (you), is always capitalized, even within the sentence.
This is how they distinguish between verbal forms and objects, based on a rule.
One could argue that it makes reading easier, although writing is relatively complicated because of the need to discover whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantiated form.
Italian pronunciation has a relative ease, since the majority of words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The basic letters that require your attention are the c and the g, as their pronunciation varies with the vowel that follows.

Persian has a relatively easy and mostly smooth grammar.
Thus, reading this introductory grammar book would help you to enrich your knowledge of Persian grammar as well as to better understand various expressions.
Of course, if you know some Latin-based languages, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those with a limited knowledge of Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to them that no separate study is needed.
Today, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and are preserved as museums or educational spaces.
Since in their heyday light pollution was not the problem it is today, they are often located in cities or on college campuses, and they are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern survey telescopes are large installations in isolated locations with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where plum blossoms were the flower of the season.
The first cherry blossom festivals in Japan were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other nobles of his court.
Plants look best in the wild, so do not be tempted to remove a sample.
Also, if you collect "samples" when visiting an officially landscaped garden, you are bound to be kicked out.
Singapore is generally a very safe and easy place to navigate, and you can get almost anything once you arrive.
However, in "high tropical climates", just north of the equator, you will have to contend with both heat (always) and intense sunshine (more rarely, in clear skies).

All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to travel, making the giant tortoise the first herbivore in the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in the Galapagos, many mammals have made their appearance, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to observe the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark throughout the day.
The fact that the areas are sparsely populated and therefore free of light pollution gives you the opportunity to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work mentality is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The costumes are typical work clothes, and colleagues are called by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the work environment is vital, as emphasis is placed on team effort rather than on rewarding individual achievement.
Often employees must have their superiors' approval for every decision, and must obey the instructions of their superiors without objection.
