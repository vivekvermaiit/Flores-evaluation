Not only does this confirm that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered in feathers, a widely held hypothesis, but it also provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brownish-brown on the upper side, with a light or orange color on the lower side.
The discovery also provides insight into how birds' feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rahis, but exhibit other characteristic elements of feathers  beards and barbs  the researchers concluded that the rahis was probably an evolutionary development that came after the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for printing. The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not chick puff.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not the puff of a chick.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 people.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system has been shown to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used combined to determine a star's Rossby number, which relates to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work submitted was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy like a kind of aura and is composed of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered the presence of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant is "very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate".
It is possible that some patients contracted the virus in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least 2 were hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he or she is in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire TB population appears to be still low; 6,000 of the 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

All the entrances to the caves, which have been called The Seven Sisters, have a diameter of between 100 and 250 meters (328 - 820 feet).
The infrared images show that the temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood that these are caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but is consistent with the hypothesis that they represent deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a somewhat technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope indicating which candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law codifies rather strictly the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of duly numbered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all stages of the process, and in the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

Four female sitters failed to complete their rounds, and 45 of the 117 giant slalom skiers failed to secure a place in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the laptop and mobile phone which had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated: We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in front of the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She was held pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered as her image was widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have decided that publishing the photos can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the criminal prosecution, has told reporters that it will not comment further at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will address the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants drawn based on the pre-war borders of the Middle East since 1967.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims that after the signing of the agreement, it will have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
The hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by the foresters, the test was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
The NPWS has a partnership with the Sport Hunter Association of Australia (NSW) to recruit qualified volunteers from the Sport Hunter Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director for Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety briefing and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have been held as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (MECI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company said were "not serious".
The Ministry responded, saying that the delay by Apple is truly regrettable.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, the photos took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestling fraternity also brought a tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman.
"Dustin Runnels, nicknamed 'Golden Powder', commented that 'Moon was as eccentric as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place.'"
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic rose by 8% from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her view, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34% of those surveyed agree with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the Commonwealth Games, in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as three relay events, but his fitness was called into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication needed to control the pain, which is forbidden during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing "political nonsense and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and lowering carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, as opposed to older systems based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and to transmit more precise information to pilots.
There is no additional transport available, the surface trains do not stop at Wembley and parking and parking facilities linked to public transport are not available in the area.
Fears about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of holding the game behind closed doors, in the absence of the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's quintessence, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus quintessence, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a multitude of patterns, rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, it can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued over another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then with your clean, wet hands, form a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange feeling and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every home, attached to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women shared.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're doing it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space on a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket, 100 feet high, to carry a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is that it has given us a much simpler and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them we have several medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of the niche; each feline has its own role to play, so it's not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and chicks.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to wolf packs or dogs, animals with surprisingly lion-like behavior (but not other large felines), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smell, sniffing the ground to find them.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and can move undetected, and they hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment and then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment from the one in which it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we can no longer say they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that is, expel from the lungs).
Plants produce food by the sun, through photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, having nothing to fear but other mosasaurs.
Its long scythes had over 70 blade-sharp teeth, along with an additional set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing in its path escaped with a good shovel.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
They also attack anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could have withstood them.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a pear.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to make benches where they sat on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include dishes that arrived in Europe, America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just the stalls facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not a large forest, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was little colonized. In the Scandinavian saga, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, he found the Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever discoveries he made, Eskimo tribes were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all Scandinavian countries, there were many differences in the population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has some writing on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads: Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776. The text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known with certainty who wrote it, it is known that in its early days the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) had been kept rolled up.
So the marking was probably done simply for labelling.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was run by the French from Vichy, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American forces with the Free French had liberated the south of France and were moving on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in some ways the size of society.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  with Congress as its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to override laws and interstate tax rates.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the island groups that Japan has, it is often said that Japan is, geographically speaking, an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan was long ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which had ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The somewhat confusing 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the frame into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together, despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power has affected everyone from kings to common mortals.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds exist specifically for this reason.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether the principle was really being followed.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted provisions of international law, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unchecked submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different time periods; each stage of China or each family holding power represented a distinct dynasty.
The best-known such interval was the Three Kingdoms Period, the 60-year span between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were bitter wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican, nationalist one, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
So did the military, because instead of armed hierarchy based on class, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond the mundane, and he often went to meditate in a cave that came to be known as Hira, located on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know it exists, because once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
The only things you can see are the clear, beautiful skies above and the surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also called the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The  upward stroke looks like a V, and the  downward stroke looks like a cap or square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the frog (i.e. the part where you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An upward bowstring usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bowstring is louder and more determined.
Feel free to mark your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for the arcs are there for musical reasons and normally must be followed.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of merchants to turn from Versailles to Paris.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of the United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear much of the cost and interest of the bonds put out on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people have been the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events unfold is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history comprising the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an inherent logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has effects on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread by 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silks and spices more valuable than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
This was the moment when the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine Oriental culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological, system that uses preserved seeds from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out of society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The distinguishing characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some wild children have been abducted by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the rejection of the child by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical deficiencies.
It's possible that the wild children experienced abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The feral child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that nursed it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the trick goes a little further.
The scaffolding or site method is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little stapler man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual schemes are built into the software, and they're designed to ask questions, provide clues, and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment where they're deprived of food, love and education, but there are.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our family care system needs to provide safe housing, caring caregivers, solid education and reliable health care.
Family care is supposed to meet the needs of the children that were not met in their previous home.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The other distinct characteristics of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of addressing types of use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
Using video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in interpreting microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause each generation to have the direction of variation dominated by one or the other of the two genetic backgrounds.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans has a hard time meeting its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so brings serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were leaf and legume proteins, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ant, termite, egg) is not only easily digested, but also provides high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
So, given all this, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to the chimpanzees on the savannahs today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep to fall back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state without waking you up completely.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it across the room, forcing yourself out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bedtime, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace that a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and everyone has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been added to by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the U.S. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process and culture led to the two countries distancing themselves.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and be fought in earnest, by 'delegated' armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans became futile almost overnight, however, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers were mobilized creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting both goods and people from one part of the oceans to another.
Traditionally, the navy's role has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them near the house for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing places, usually in the care of heifers who were often children or adolescents, similar to the well-known sheepmen.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly more irregular roads of the time.
The crossbars were introduced early enough to hold the rails in place, but it was eventually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal band on top.
This became a widespread practice, but iron led to faster wear of the wagons' wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first all-iron rails were produced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in 4.2-3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus fossils, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the green movement, and we can even become activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases, however, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should disable them.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and problems are greater now because of humanity's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as Dunlap posters.
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters still extant are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But you can still see many dinosaur-like features in birds.
They have scaled legs and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and the designation of these numbers is binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The best indication for internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates in the ancient resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer beetles and bedbugs are nest-builders, adapted to life in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works using the scientific method, and this method is applied in most scientific research.
It's not the only one though, and experimentation is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have made extensive use of classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Our body clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments marking either the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-type cells can be passed on to children, while mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism organized around the exploration of nature attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be to visit, photograph and learn more about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural settlements to their workplaces, passing others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has dislocated the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last 2 million years.
They all participate in society and use transportation systems, and almost all of them complain about transportation systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such discontent, why do they fail day after day? Is it because transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is it something worse?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Traffic flow studies are unfortunately difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; therefore, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we need to relate the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to begin to fly, and their ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mates to mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerides.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely, that the Solar System actually revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying over eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at some points six miles wide.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and it collects the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical craftsmanship.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which by then were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known since ancient times about some fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to mine using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements - water, earth, air, and fire.
He was referring to the four states of matter, in the same order: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloy is actually a combination of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You'll see that some alloys can also include small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny, that trillions could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a friend to many after it was created.
Sadly, as newer writing instruments came into use, the pencil lost its status and its number of uses.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to put their hands on a sharpener.
You can't help but wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km at the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker in the higher elevations.
There might be more marsh nearby, because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying what elements people are interested in or enjoying.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into adulthood.
These theories study what makes people want to do what they do and what in their environment may cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's pyramid of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or "one of the girls").
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who think they have to change everything the team has done and do it their own way.
After all, the leader is the one primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
And often, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which might not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be unleashed.
As a result, the process by which an organisation works as a unit to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
The data from neurobiology represents physical evidence that underpins a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, and as such, allows the area of research to be narrowed and defined with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that were previously unseen.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
While AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and adapting intelligence to machines.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but has also been used in some software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom, and often a teacher would love to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the solution with virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is remodeled, and the previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student's written expression.While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their study far beyond the ordinary school day.
Proper use of blogs can help students to think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to material found on the Internet, students can define their own position in the context of what others have written, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka District and more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider the quintessential Canadian.
Larger portions further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that has the gift of surprising many: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's okay to wear the ring, but don't make it look expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what may be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when rejecting a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's still not OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and sailors, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajine, pottery, pilgrimage objects, hookahs and lots of all kinds of trinkets, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the settlement, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, visits outside the city require an outreach effort to understand the state of the fighting that is still raging in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for the climbing of Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
The usual (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger posed by the desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the Henry Louis Gates PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the national parks in this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a number of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, and it is the place that many tourists look to as the focal point.
The display of buildings contributing to Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glowing bar chart that is enhanced by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon, across the water.
The largest area of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed into reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonists and they appropriated and therefore for anyone who is looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, however - they also include some of the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has become a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses that connect districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 No) or Punakha (200 No).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 273 feet (83 m), it is 1,298 feet (378 m) long and has two 12-foot (3.5 m) wide strips.
The free-standing crossing height under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called The Gigantic Province of the Indies, was born in the 16th century after the Spanish conquistadors encountered its indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has struggled to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although British and American currency is likely to be accepted; contact the owners in advance to find out what payment methods they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands pounds outside the country, so you must exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, where temperatures often exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from other wildlife!
No matter how docked it may seem, the bison, the moose, the bear, and almost all other large animals can attack man.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance properly, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's good to give them their space.
In addition, be aware that the smells may attract bears and other wildlife, so it would be wise to avoid strong-smelling food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a naval confrontation of sad memory in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of Tupua supreme chieftain Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is between two harbours, and the most famous of these are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour district), on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide array of shops arranged along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
You can find a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian would be better.
The local tap water is drinkable, but if you're worried you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. The fruit juices are peppered as price, but very good.
Many visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to catch a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, be aware of the location of the cabin, as navigation through the ice makes an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent by customers and the money spent by them. There are usually no windows and clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the good mood and guests staying in the premises.
Some bars offer drinks on a house-to-house basis, but drunkenness affects judgment, and good players know the importance of staying sober.
Drivers who will be driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes should take into account the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short period of time, enough snow may fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or snowdrifts or condensation, or ice formation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic runs for the most part uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's premier tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to trips on land undertaken to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially those on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow good viewing of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll be able to see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, safari hike, or walking) consists of hiking either for a few hours or for a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations within Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your 2020 flight tickets and accommodation before the postponement was announced, you may be facing a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, coronavirus cancellation policies were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Stepping on wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron or if you do not like to wear socks that are ironed, then you can try using a hairdryer if you have one at hand.
Care should be taken not to allow the material to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, more minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their efficiency, and if you're worried, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation or, in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a human using physical force, are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity to buy goods in certain places free of taxes and excise duties.
Travellers who are going to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The portion between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult traffic conditions of the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often crossing through isolated and undeveloped areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose your temper: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves are common.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections  generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is all the more important that they are strictly adhered to.
However, quite bizarrely, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the route, e.g., Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used throughout the year and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a food based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be dry or liquid depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catchall term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
Used without any other qualification, however, the term tends to indicate the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of dishes spiced with simplicity, the predominant tastes preferred by Javanese being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored condiments.
The ladder supports the rider's feet, hanging from either side of the rail.
They provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety problems, as it is possible for a rider's feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the saddle but has one foot on the ladder, the horse can drag him along as he chases.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stair straps to detach from the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a rider falling off the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - the most sought after place for mountaineering in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and high granite peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits, and climbers from all over the world are continually charting new routes through the walls with unlimited potential.
Snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, which consist of sliding down the snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums in English, who organize their entire vacations around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old. We have cave paintings of skiers from before 5000 B.C.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is a related activity, but one that does not usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being conducted on much steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking  but very rarely will you be able to reach typical cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on your back on well-groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, normally crossing several countries would mean going through visa and passport control procedures over and over again.
In this respect, the Schengen Area is organised in a way as one country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control.
Similarly, a Schengen visa holder does not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member countries individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique, and some tax agencies consider antiques to be goods that are over 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical location, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami, and the culture related to trade is also important for many who have other professions.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as beasts of burden.
Nowadays, many Sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word gypsy is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population.
If the country you are going to visit is subject to a traveller's warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified way, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
'Extreme weather' is a generic term used for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and come in many forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, sea storms, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of the severe weather risks facing the area as it could upset their travel plans.
It is recommended that anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for 'hostile environment course' will probably provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are plentiful, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports on which the sex (X) is not stated or documents updated to correspond with the desired name and sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as much.
Checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after 9/11.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through scans without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Back currents are the flow back to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a fast current can be formed towards the deep waters.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion in trying to swim backwards against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to head towards a position where you're not caught again, and depending on your skills and whether or not anyone saw you, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock manifests itself more quickly than culture shock (it lasts less than the euphoria of the honeymoon), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have great difficulty adjusting to their native culture.
If you return home after living abroad, you will have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your native culture.
When you first moved abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that visiting a new country requires a process of adaptation.
People don't always expect that patience and understanding is required for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most exciting things for children in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
The noise of tourists and vendors is usually heard constantly, and the sound and light show seems to have come from a storybook.
The sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the south of the peninsula that is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula Mountains join to give birth to this plateau, then split again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m (16,030 ft).
In remote places with no phone service, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot take the place of a cell phone, because you have to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite to be able to make a call.
The service is often used in maritime transport, including by pleasure craft, as well as by shipments requiring the remote transmission of data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people planning a year off is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending a university, without jeopardizing their educational path.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can even increase your chances of gaining access to higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee payable on enrolment in these educational programmes.
Finland is a wonderful place for boating. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the offshore archipelagos and largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller craft or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is 1 in forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several full days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you go ashore only for excursions on board a ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009)
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not unlike the personal fears and dislikes about other things that manifest in so many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft operates and what happens during flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is critical in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies had their own planes, but other routes and the smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and clear.
The only way to make it go faster was to send it as hold baggage.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do it for you).
But it's not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and up to eleven times more for first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, in which case they charge fares according to requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern commercial center, situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls, feature traditional 18th-century red-brick roofs as well as old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons above some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became out of the country following an enthusiastic survey of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the northern part you can visit the Sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin of Fatima, a place known throughout the world for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that you are basically visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't vandalize the place by drawing and scratching on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the panels are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transportation, among other services.
Periodic announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although it is often just a stereotype that does not correspond to reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is bien élevé (well-behaved) will help you to cope much more easily.
The reserved attitude of the Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and mountain rooster can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries offer blankets for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from the ones available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, greens, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available spices such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always start with a capital letter, even within the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or adjective being used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most being pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters you need to pay more attention to are the c and the g, because their pronunciation varies with the vowel after them.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Obviously, a person who knows a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may prematurely conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated today and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Since in their heyday light pollution was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas with favorable weather conditions.
The sight of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the imperial court aristocracy.
Plants look no better than in their natural environment, so don't be tempted to pick just one of them.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting "specimens" will also result in your expulsion, no questions asked.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, where you can easily navigate and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
But being in the 'upper tropics', just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when it's clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, where tradition has it that the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried along with their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There's a tradition of spending the Easter night awake, outdoors, to watch the sunrise.
There are of course explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening in Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the distance from the mainland, mammals have not been able to make the journey, and as a result, the giant tortoise is the main animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon line.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not so often a problem, you'll be able to enjoy the stars, too.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Costumes are the standard business attire, and coworkers address one another by their surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is a key element, with emphasis on team effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers often have to get their superiors' approval for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
