This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but provides information about the fossils that cannot normally be given, such as colour and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were brownish-brown on the upper surface and pale or yellow on the inner side.
This discovery also provides a subtle insight into the evolution of birds' feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have well-developed thin stalks, called rechis, but had other features of feathers - barbs and barbels - researchers speculated that rechis was probably a later evolutionary development than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for thermoregulation or display. The researchers suggested that although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the tail of an adult child appears in this specimen, rather than under a chick.
The researchers suggest that even though this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows that it is adult feathers, not chickens' feathers.

Although 3 people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed and the driver of the red Audi TT was released through emergency services.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was eventually transferred to the hospital at Edenbrook in Cambridge.
Adeboye has since been charged with murdering her son in Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is in custody and pending indictment and trial by the court, but there is no possibility of any eyewitness evidence as his image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently and courts have seen the publication of the photos as potentially biased.
"Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, notes that ""journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if photos of suspects are published, etc.""
The Crown Office, which is the overall controller of the complaints process, told reporters that no comment would be made until an indictment is made.
The document, according to the leak, would refer to a border dispute based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War, which Palestine wanted.
Other issues covered in detail include the future state of Jerusalem that is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley problem.
After the signing of the agreement, Israel is seeking to maintain the current military presence in the valley for ten years while the PA agrees to keep such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were closely monitored by rangers as the trial was regulated and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's Hunting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of NPWS's Garden Conservation and Cultural Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive security and training instruction.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth CEP of Martell in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country forward towards new elections.
Martelli reacted with the Commission to the anti-regime protests that began in October.
After 2011, the failure to hold elections led to violent protests.
About 60 cases of iPods overheating while malfunctioning were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and as many as four people being burned in a minor manner.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving appliances.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 heating incidents, which the company called ""non-serious"".
"The ministry responded to Apple's postponement of the report by saying it was ""really regrettable""".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Marianas said no casualties were reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has kidnapped a bus of Hong Kong tourists in the Philippine capital of Manila and held them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including Filipino photographers and children as well as the elderly, were released earlier.
Photographers took the place of an elderly woman as she needed to go to Jajiro. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Leggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Despite working in a hospital, Liggins began to investigate pre-mature labor in his spare time.
His research found that if the hormone is given, the fetus's lungs develop more rapidly.
"Government investigators recovered two flight recorders, called ""black boxes"", on Wednesday, Xinhua reported".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said that ""Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna died between two moons. Just as attractive as she was. A strong woman"."
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said that ""Luna was as eccentric as I am....maybe even more so....love her and miss her.....hopefully she's in a better place".""
In a poll of 1,400 voters taken before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing bringing a republic to Australia had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed in her 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled held the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the poll, 29 per cent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but there are doubts about her fitness due to her complaints.
The pain medication was not taken as it was banned in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number ever on January 25.
Several people tested the invention in early February, using different types of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of bringing synthetic materials to Earth that could make water and proteins and support the formation of life.
Scientists try to understand how planets form, especially regarding the formation of the Earth, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex relations.
"He called the rumors ""political gossip and nonsense""".
He is likely to run for president in the 2016 election.
NextGen is a system, according to the FAA, that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and reduce carbon emissions by saving millions of gallons of fuel each year.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, so that the air traffic controller can more accurately detect the aircraft and provide more accurate information to the pilot.
No new transportation facilities will be introduced and overground trains will not run at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the team would be forced to play behind closed doors without supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the creation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Reports from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process would take longer, due to crossbreeding between the native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortress, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza coniarostris.
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can also be molded into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wires, which can be twisted and striped. It can be hammered or turned into a plate.
"It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called ""illuminated manuscripts""".
This chemical is called pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the strength of hydrogen in the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (H) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms have 1 proton and 1 electron).
Mix two powders and then fill the mixture into the jar with clean and green hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and create a kind of shield.
Almost every house in the towns of Hadappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a developed sewer system.
Remains of ancient sewer systems have been found in Minoan cities of Crete and in houses of the Greco-Socratic period.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also common. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, used jointly by women and men.
When you call someone who lives thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
A call is received to a satellite in space and it sends it down immediately afterward.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere makes the scenes and light there appear blurred.
A 100 feet high rocket is required to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheels have brought about incredible changes in the world. The biggest thing that the wheels have given us is the ease and speed of transportation.
He gave us trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is that the concept of this space, each cat holds a special job that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups known as pride.
Prides are a group of one to three adult males, thirty females, and young.
Sisters and daughters are a large family, resulting in women being primarily close to each other.
Lion's prey acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, other animals also behave like lions (except for the other big cats), who are very ferocious to their prey.
A good spherical athlete, the tiger can climb (though not perfectly), swim, make long jumps, and scratch with 5 times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards and jaguars (Panthera). Only these four cats can thunder.
The roar of the lion is not the roar of the lion, but the voice of many a strong man, and the voice of a great voice.
The ossilators like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and if possible birds. Any animal that the ossilators prey on is much smaller than its own size.
Scientists think that osseotes eat animals by smell and detect, sniff, where they were on the ground.
They can see well at night due to their night vision, and can also move stealthily. Osslots can blend into the surrounding space and then attack and hunt prey.
When a small group of organisms (small population) diverges from its main group (for example when they migrate over a mountain or a river, or reach a new island from which they cannot return) they find themselves in a new environment.
In this new environment with different resources and different competitors, the new generation will need different facilities or adaptations than they needed before, to become strong competitors.
The basic population has not changed a bit, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they will look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations of separated animals will start to look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. It also provides shade.
We make our homes and clothes from trees, we get most of our food from trees, and animals cannot live without trees.
The mosasaur was the supreme predator of its time, so it feared no one but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that passed in its path.
We are not sure but its tongue would have been split open. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mossaurs and it is possible that it was a cannibal.
Attacking anything that entered the water, even a large dinosaur like T. rex could not have resisted it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, while the Romans had their share of exotic or unusual banqueting items that included wild boar, deer, slugs, and a type of rat called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to eat where they could, by their side while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine may not have included foods coming to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple for each of their gods that they called the house of the god in human.
People would bring offerings to the Lord and the priests would try to fulfill the Lord's wishes through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard of the temple and then an inner garbhagiriya which could only be entered by the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of temples, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the Lord.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not of much importance.
A large part of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the storerooms had open counters that could be seen from the street. The houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan had no relatively large forests, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was founded sporadically. The Norse saga tells that Erik the Red was sentenced to exile from Iceland for murder and instead of travelling further west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of their findings, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might have thought that the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map drawn on the back.
Although the document has something written on the back, it is not a treasure map.
"The words on the back of the Declaration of Independence read, ""The original Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776"". This text appears written at the bottom of the document. "
No one knows who wrote it, it is known that initially, the large leather paper documents (it measures 293/4 inches by 241/2 inches) were folded for storage.
So, it is possible that the notation was added as a label only.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not free.
"It was ruled by the 'Vichy' French, who had made a treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them rather than fighting the invaders".
"On 15 August 1940, Allied forces attacked the south of France, an invasion known as ""Operation Dragoon""".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a substantially large group of people who live and work cooperatively in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also defines the size of society as such.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. A civilized culture is the passing of knowledge through many generations, a cultural heritage and a relative spread.
Smaller civilizations largely disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to gain recognition as a proper civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government whose sole component was the Congress under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state officials, who were not always cooperative, to do all its work.
It had no right to negotiate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The amendment of the article required unanimous consent of all the states and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national football team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Italians participate in international sports festivals and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as an 'island' geographically because of the group of islands close to Japan.
Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in the tribal grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan as a territory of the Qing state.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu mainly consists of 3 structures, named, Intihuana, the Sun Temple, and the Room with 3 Windows.
Most of the buildings that were fairly close to the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, 30 percent of the Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still image photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant size of film in the late analog film era.
It is still produced today, but, importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm structure is actually somewhat confusing, 36mm wide times 24mm high.
The ratio of this constitution (rather than dividing by a bar to get the ratio of whole numbers) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common structures (the APS family of structures, for example) are identical or very close to this size ratio.
The much-sought and ridiculed Rule of Thirds is a simple guide to building dynamics while maintaining order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the ends of the lines dividing the third part of the drawing vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, over a period of a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states.
His omnipotent power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's treasuries are specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this doctrine was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of war, Britain had a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, leading to the shutdown of vital military and civilian supplies. The blockade, however, was contrary to many international treaties dating back 2 centuries and generally accepted international law.
To prevent any ships from entering the entire part of the sea, Britain built a tunnel in international waters, which also posed a danger to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a spirit of pacifism and isolationism prevailed in most nations and citizens.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations were moved to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents in his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Bachler (his manager in his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods.
There was a turbulent era of provinces divided between each dynasty. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in the magnificent palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as adoption of the metric system, transition from authoritarian rule to democracy, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, jobs were available to all male applicants, with the most ambitious and successful allowed to succeed.
The same is true for the army as the army's ranks were now based on caliber rather than being based on class.
The French Revolution also inspired the crushed workers of other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad had a deep interest in things beyond this material life. He frequently went to a cave on the mountain of ""Nour"" (Light) to meditate, which became known as ""Hira""".
He himself discovered natural caves that have survived over time, which gives a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on top of a mountain in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knows it exists, it is not easy to find it. Once inside the cave, it is total solitude.
There is nothing to see but the beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of several giant pyramids built in honor of the pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Necropolis of Giza"" (the largest of which is the famous Pyramid of Giza), in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains many pyramids, many smaller tombs, many temples, and vast artifacts".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and concubines.
The ""up arrow"" symbol looks like a V and the ""down arrow"" like a staple or square whose bottom side is missing. "
Up means you should start from the top and push the bow, and down means you should start from the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
And the upper arch usually creates a thin sound, while the lower arch creates a stronger and more persistent sound.
You can mark with a pencil around your own signs, but remember that there are also Bowing signs printed for musical reasons, so they should be respected in general.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were chased back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
In a coach they returned to Paris and a mob surrounded the king and queen, threatening and threatening them.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their coaches open.
At one point, a member of the mob shook the head of a dead royal guard at Versailles before a frightened queen.
The cost of US imperialism in conquering the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime through Wall Street banking houses to pay a large part of the expenses and interest on the liquid bonds in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would establish the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the formation of the sect.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses various ideas in practice, technology-pushed or technologically essential in the strict sense that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their expression in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological developments are largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technologies ""affect"" societies internally rather than socially. """
For example, one might say that if there is to be a motor car, it will be necessary to develop roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of manufacturing have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also causes an increasing incidence of accidents on the roads, which motivates the search for new technologies to repair physical defects and treat health.
Romanticism has a broad component of cultural fatalism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fitch and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, individuals shaped by geography and over time customs and culture related to that geography arose and these people were better than arbitrarily imposed laws because they were consistent with the place of society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of a peaceful Europe.
Its reputation for being a centre of splendour began in about 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 BC.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the jihadists returned with gift-related goods such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than the value offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
The Byzantine culture in the east initially had a strong influence on dressing.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western European countries began to develop their own style. One of the major developments of the time as a result of the movement was the use of buttons to wear clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done to produce enough grain to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Survival agriculture is a simple, mostly organic, system that uses previously preserved seeds from the local ecological area to increase yields with crop rotation or some other relatively simple method.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this practice is still practiced in many developing countries.
Secondary cultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms and give them an identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture differently may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of secondary culture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashions, manners, and typical language.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization draws attention to a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults when they were growing up through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
"Such children are called ""vulgar"" or savage. Some savage children are kept in check by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of this child was due to the parent's rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability".
Wild children may have experienced excessive abuse or torture before they ran away or were abandoned.
Others are accused of being raised by animals; some are said to live in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, such a feral child's behavior is almost identical to that of its host animal (within physical limits), such as its fear of humans or its insensibility to humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding is a step ahead.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but an aid that helps people who are having a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffold but the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is also a scaffold.
Simulations are built into software and are meant to question, demonstrate alertness, and clarify processes that are challenging for a student to focus on alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and embezzlement.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educating, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe housing, loving caregivers, balanced education, and reliable health care.
It is believed that foster care will meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both collective and interpersonal messaging.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and accessibility.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" may be suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)".
"Igmey and McCord (1998) identified that ""personal engagement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were also new motivational aspects when they were examining audience responses on websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that whether or not a person is lying can be known by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his paper Presidents Speech, Oliver Sacks, indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless accurate to make sincere assessments.
They also suggest that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be compared to those of domesticated animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
There is a separate and re-merged shuffle variation back and forth between the two sets with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to satisfy its amino-acid requirements from plant sources available.
And failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources may be the accessible proteins in the leaves and pods but if they are not cooked they are difficult for human animals like us to digest.
In contrast, animal diets (worms, lice, eggs) are not only easily digestible but they also provide high quality protein that contains all these amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised that our own ancestors may have solved their ""protein problem"" in some way similar to the way chimpanzees on the savannah today solve theirs".
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you are resetting the clock to sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking plenty of water before bedtime (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of any person is inversely related to the degree of stress in the person's body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive life force is present. Everyone has the capacity to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve self-realization. The only obstacle to achieving this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many practices of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It shows the way to adopt the Kundalini yoga, meditation and love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the energy of Kundalini (Bodh Energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing practice, mantra and mental imagery.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is Devata Yoga. Through the contemplation of various deities, the channels of energy are cleared, the energy centers of the body are activated and the knowledge consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the United States and Russia. With the end of World War II, conflicts of order, process, and culture led to the countries' collapse.
Two years after the war ended, former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought by proxy armies for real, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defences had been broken and the only hope of reuniting was at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were cancelled almost overnight, when more than 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army, after invading Poland's eastern territories in violation of both the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Agreement, and other unilateral and multilateral treaties, entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
The use of ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and things, while also interfering with your enemy's ability to move their own people and things.
The most recent and most notable examples of this were the North Atlantic Campaign of WWII. The Americans moved men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, perhaps Germany would have won over Britain, as it had with the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep it for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed over the hills or other grazing areas, often drawn by herders who were mostly children or teenagers, the most widely known term being herding. These methods of animal husbandry are still used today.
The construction of wagonways had been going on since the early 16th century in England.
The wagonways had only wooden parallel planks, yet they allowed the horses to achieve greater speed and to pull larger loads than the more rugged roads of the day.
Crosses were introduced very early to maintain the track. However, it was gradually realized that the track would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriage.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron bars were introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning 'straight man') twenty million years ago.
His predecessors, the Australopithecus did not walk straight as was customary.
Bipedal features are found in the 4.2-3.9 million-year-old fossil of Australopithecus, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
However, if we don't see just a temporary solution then we should try to find the root cause of that disease and address it.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have increased due to the overpopulation and excessive lifestyle of mankind.
After being accepted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress president John Hancock and minister Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
"Overnight 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as ""Dunlap Broadsides""".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
1 was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy of it reached London on 10 August.
The 25 documents of Dunlap Brodside that still survive are the oldest extant copies. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have wings and they can fly.
But there are still many stories about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their back two legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on tampering with information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can be only one of two, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - to use computer jargon.
Internal toxicity should not appear immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that they cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The presence of an open container of medications or household chemicals may be an excellent indicator of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific instructions for primary care for that specific toxin.
The term ant is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with the cricket, a parasitic creature on humans.
Both the mosquito and the mosquito are migratory, either in their burrows or in the homes of those who shelter them.
Across the U.S., there are approximately 4,00,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
The couple may choose to plan to adopt a child for themselves.
When adopting, the birth parents terminate their rights, so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main objective of science is to determine how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not alone, experimentation is used to eliminate one or more possible assumptions. Asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Bible in Latin.
For all things scientific, including psychology, Aristotle's views are valid.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself alienated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many apparent rhythms of physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals
Biological clocks have automatically moving pendulums that, even without an external clock, run uninterrupted for a period of time.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted 2 experiments marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the fraction of the genetic element affected, and the germ-line cells affected.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the natural landscapes including flora and wild wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
One example is about visiting, photographing and learning about the Orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplace and leave others whose workplace is the same place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is connected and supports the private car based transport system as they wish.
Science now suggests that this vast carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from its one stable state, which has supported human development for the last two million years.
Everyone becomes part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone has a complaint about the transport system.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing are rarely heard.
Why does the transportation system risk such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening.
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between 2 points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow, as the behavior of a driver cannot be predicted with 1-hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers drive at a moderately steady pace; therefore, the flow of traffic remains somewhat moderately steady and can be mathematically represented somewhat as a flow.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operating the roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they will be able to fold their wings back with the body.
This gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, insects that cannot retract their wings are only winged and short-lived creatures.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought it was true but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, which included the sun (and other stars as well).
This is understandable, because he doesn't realize that the earth is spinning, what happens?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes being six miles wide.
The Amazon is responsible for a full 20 percent of the water that flows from the Earth's rivers to the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza did not surpass their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were over a thousand years old at the time, fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as all of these are naturally found in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, who was a philosopher, proved that everything is made up of a combination of these 1 to 4 elements, earth, water, air and fire.
The four elements of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, were similar, although he also theorized that they transform into new elements to form what we see.
Alloys are composed of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You may also find alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Everything is made of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is surprisingly small enough to fit millions of atoms by the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was put to a lower place in use.
People now type messages on computer screens, never to come close to the sharpener.
It is a matter of imagination what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes out of the keyboard.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to accumulate a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like taking a very heavy loaded cart up a hill. By splitting the nucleus again, it's released from the energy.
Some of the centers of the eyelids are unstable, meaning that they are unable to separate with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the mantle.
This crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thin under the marble and thick under the height.
There may be more maria nearby because the crust is thin. It was easier to go to the surface for lava.
Content theory focuses on what attracts people's attention.
These theories suggest that people have certain internally repressed needs and/or desires until they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about some people that makes them want to do the work they do and what their work environment makes them do or not do certain jobs.
Two popular content theories are the Maslow hierarchy needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tends to be "being a man" (or gal)".
Such managers may have difficulty in making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes a different kind of unrecognizable person who feels that whatever the team is doing, he should change it and make it his own.
After all, ultimately the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often creates friction between leaders and the rest of the team.
Real teams have the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with a fine margin.
In many cases virtual team members serve as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more freedom than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
"The presence of a true ""virtual team"" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) was also a unique component of the simulated team".
""The ""invisible team"" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member. "
Why would an institution want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational institution? One goal of implementing institutional education concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity are manifested in the functional departments of the organization.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome barriers can lead to a new creative process to meet customer needs.
Before an institution can innovate, it should be able to create an innovation environment through appropriate leadership and facilitate the exchange of institutional information and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the need for a sustainability approach that helps organizations to achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide real evidence for the theoretical approach to direct cognition. Therefore, it narrows the area of research and makes it more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, wounds, and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
With the rise of new technologies, we can see and examine structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build replica models that help us understand the processes of our brains.
Although artificial intelligence has implications for science fiction, artificial intelligence is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with machine behavior, learning, and its adaptation to intelligence.
Research in AI involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, as well as signature recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become a separate discipline, which focuses on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, used in some home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions that include virtual field trips. Students can sit in their classroom and view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art.
Sharing field trip information virtually is a great way to rethink the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina visit the state capital every year and create a website about it, which is recreated every year, but the old version is saved online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can help improve a student's writing. Students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually makes a difference.
Because students are often the most critical listeners, the blog writer tries to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging ""forces students to become more aware of the world around them"". It motivates students to be clever and interesting to cater to the audience's interest and need (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond the traditional school curriculum.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical: by actively responding to Internet content, students can define their position in relation to the writings of others as well as outline their own perspective on specific issues (Orewake, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and has magnificent art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
The far south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to the natural beauty of Muscocca and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Large areas in the north are very sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited forest.
The population comparison is one that surprises people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are associated with independent nations, or France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also spread Islam to various regions, and this was done on a large scale in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The area is bounded on the north by the Sahel and the Atlantic Ocean on the south and west.
Women: It is advised that any female passenger should state that she is married, whether they are married or not.
It also helps to wear a ring (which may not look too expensive).
Women should realize that what they perceive as harassment may be cultural differences and it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether it's because of cultural differences or not, it doesn't matter).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century by Berber fishermen, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Enfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan and Spanish merchants named it Casablanca and established a base of trade there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find shops distributing traditional Moroccan goods such as teignets, pottery, leather goods, hooks and gigabits around the old medina, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda in the far east.
Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano in 2002, which buried most of the city streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is properly secured, any visits outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some inexpensive mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
"With its relative accessibility, ""Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sands, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
The African was one of the special wonders of the world during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the World.
The city is quite different from other cities in the country, as it has more Arabic potential than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Magare River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is considered the main site of South Africa's National Parks (Sunparks).
Like other South African national parks, the park has a daily enclosure and entrance fee.
It may also be beneficial for someone to purchase a wild card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or even all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is a place that many tourists consider a major hub.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline was compared to a glittering bar chart, highlighted by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is where the British colonialists took their place and so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Durban is the world's largest coastal rainforest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the inland regions of India and Bangladesh.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory known as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just sets of mangroves, though - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests, which were scattered over the territory of the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/soil areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife and according to an adha, there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (Nadipar) throughout the day, although most people, especially those heading to the east side and towards Jakar/Bathang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are usually crowded, so it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (NU 150) and Punaha (NU 200).
The Oiapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oiapok River in French Guinea to connect Oiapok and Saint Georges d'Oiapok, Brazil.
Both towers have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, as well as its two roads having a width of 3.50 meters.
The permitted vertical drop below the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuru and the Peaygui, who survived by hunting, assembling, and fishing.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called ""the great land of the Indies"", was born as a result of clashes between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous people".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of its indigenous characteristics and identities.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Field in Las Canitas.
Small competitions and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
Check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo for news on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo matches.
The Falkland pound (FKP) is the currency of the Falklands whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank of the islands located in Stanley, next to the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and United States dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be taken; check in advance with the owners to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland's currency for the island's currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montvideo is south of the equator, it is summer here when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely freeze, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it colder than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no specific ""rainy"" and ""dry"" seasons: rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year".
Although it is natural for many animals in the park to see humans, wildlife is wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and at least 25 yards away from other wildlife!
Giant animals like wild bulls, deer, bears, no matter how cool they look, they can attack at any time.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep proper distance. Such animals can be huge, wild, and dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that bears and other wildlife are attracted to scents, so don't cook or take scented food with you, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.

In 1889, the port became the site of a notorious naval blockade when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
A peaceful convention held in the city during the struggle for independence by Mao, which resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasi Lilofi III.
There are many beaches due to the two harbors of Auckland being collapsed. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore Beach (in the North Harbor District) is on the Pacific Ocean and extends south from Long Bay in North Devonport.
All of those beaches are almost sandy where it is safe to swim, and most of them are shaded by Ponhotukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with good shops along the shore. It is safe to swim.
"The main local beer is 'number one,' not a complex beer, but enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called ""Monta""".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better spread.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find out if bottled water scares you.
The idea of flat white coffee is foreign to Australians. Small black coffee is 'espresso', brewed with cappuccino cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is just up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but also excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made year-round and injuries due to any of these causes are rare on the reef.

Box jellyfish are found from October to April, near the coast and river deltas north of 1770. They are also occasionally seen outdoors during this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their main habitat being in the estuary, in the river north of Rock-Hampton.
Booking in advance gives the passengers peace of mind that once they reach their destination, they will find somewhere to sleep.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast at the airport, transportation arrangements, or a combined flight and hotel package.
They may also reserve a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or buy other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any corrections or requests should be addressed first through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most people attending a music festival decide to camp on site, and most attendants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action that is going to happen, arrive early to get to a camping site near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage has ended, there will be sections of the festival where music will be played late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as passing through the snow creates a terrible noise for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in shares. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the rules).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exit may be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drinking alcohol can impair judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of not getting drunk.
Anyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or frozen temperatures.
The friction is less on snowy and icy roadways and you cannot drive as you would on open asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow may fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be obstructed by snowfall or blowing or by the accumulation of snow on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, in many countries snowy and icy weather is common and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
A safari is perhaps the biggest attraction of travel in Africa and a major trip for many visitors.
The word safari has a popular meaning among people who travel overland to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to come close to cars, at times standard equipment will make it easier to see well.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a ""bush walk"", ""hiking safari"", or ""going for a walk"") involves traveling on foot for several hours or several days".
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at different venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies from late March do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with general tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have iron and ironing boards available for lawns, whether or not one is present in the room.
If ironing is not available, or if you don't want the fancy of wearing ironing socks, then you can use a hairdryer if possible.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against certain hazards.
Boiling water for one minute is sufficient in some areas, while in others it may require several minutes.
Strainers vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their own territories.
Pets can spoil food, irritate or, in worse cases, cause allergies, spread poisons or cause infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or monstrous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people are not usually called plagues.
Duty Free Shopping means the opportunity to buy items free of duty and tax, which are available in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes sometimes save a good amount of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, with frequent passes through distinct backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be smart about your approach: sudden gradients, narrow streets, and sharp turns are more likely.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and strict compliance on this is even more important than otherwise.
Surprisingly, however, mobile phone service here is much stronger than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good and rich in Bavarian variety and ingredients, similar to those found in its southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastry is common, with apples being cooked in a year-round pastry and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German roasted salads also include nuts, walnuts, and other tree nuts. The popular cake is often paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but heavy pastry, serve a berliner, a fancohn, or a craffen, depending on the region.
Kadhi is a dish based on herbs and spices, including meat or vegetables.
"The drain can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of liquid drained".
Yogurt is commonly used in curries in the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan. Coconut milk is commonly used in southern India and some other coastal areas in the subcontinent.
Choosing from 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a sixteenth term covering the variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
But, if used without qualifier further, the term means that these foods originate from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features many highly seasoned dishes, with main flavors including peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's feet that are hung on either side of the saddle.
They give more stability to the rider but can raise safety concerns due to the possibility of getting stuck in the rider's leg.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but falls on one leg in motion, the horse may be pulled over if it escapes. To reduce this risk, several ways of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most people wear riding boots with an edge and a sole, with a fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar, which allows the leather to fall down from the saddle if pulled back.
Cocham Valley - Chile's main climbing site, known as the Yosemite of South America, with large walls and cracks of various types of granite.
The peaks of the mountain range include amazing scenery. Mountaineers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes on the walls of its endless possibilities.
Low hill sports including skiing and snowboarding are popular sports, including skiing or snowboarding with your feet attached to which you can slide down on snow-covered ground.
"""Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as ""ski bumpers"", planning entire holidays around skiing in a particular location".""
The concept of skiing is very old. The skiers in the cave paintings are 5000 years old!
Downhill skiing as a sport can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is associated with but not usually included with alpine-style ski tourism or mountaineering, mountaineering that occurs in upright sloping terrain and requires more rigid skis and boots.
Consider a skiing trail as equivalent to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover a little more distance than walking - but you will hardly be able to get the speed for skiing from one end of the country to the other without a heavy backpack on a well-equipped track.
Europe is a continent, relatively small but home to many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to different countries there often requires going through visa applications and passport regulation.
However, the Schengen area is doing a lot as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each country that is a member of Schengen, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what makes a manufactured item antique. Some tax agencies define items that are over 100 years old as antiques.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where age limits may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be considered as antique, although they are of an earlier stage than such goods produced in abundance.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami people and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many people with other occupations.
Although, even traditionally, not all Sami are engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but rather derive employment from work such as fishing, often by stopping the reindeer for special tasks.
Today many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romani, the term ""gypsy"" is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and misconceptions of the Romani people".
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can take advice from the government as well as your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
To take one example, American citizens in Middle Eastern countries face different situations than Europeans and Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often more general and simpler than the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for any hazardous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and has different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are the form and effects of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather events include snowfall, cold storms, snowstorms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risks of bad weather affecting their area as they may affect any travel plans.
Everyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should undergo vocational training.
A search on the internet for 'adverse environment course' might show the address of a local company.
The course will generally cover all the issues discussed here in greater detail, mostly with practical experience.
The course will normally be 2-5 days and will include role-playing, many first aid treatments and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and magazines about living in the wilderness are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Voyagers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have the proper documents to return.
In case of not specifying gender (X) or not updating documents for desired name and gender, the willingness of governments to issue passports varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with these documents is equally varied.
In the post-September 11, 2001 era, searches at security checkpoints have become even more intrusive.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect their dignity and privacy to be intact while undergoing a scanner.
A rip current is a current that flows back out from the ocean waves, often in the form of a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deep sections and there can be a rapid flow of deep water.
Most deaths result from fatigue that is made impossible by trying to swim back against the current.
After you get out of the flow, swimming back is no more difficult than it usually is.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skill and whether you've noticed or not, you can wait for a rescue.
Re-entry shock comes earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
While migrants can easily adapt to a new culture, they sometimes have a hard time adjusting to their home culture.
You have adopted a new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture while returning home after living abroad.
When you first move to a foreign country, people may be patient and understanding, knowing that adjustments are necessary.
People may not have expected that the return of migrants also requires patience and understanding.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the children's area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the voices of travelers and traders. The story of sound and light is quite like a story book.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are depicted on the pyramid and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest base with sixteen active islands in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the still active volcano's shallow mouth forms a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here the peninsular mountains merge into the plateau and then reemerge to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains Mount Vinson, the highest mountain range in Antarctica, with the Vinson Massif reaching an elevation of 4,892 metres (12,029 ft).
In remote locations, since there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are not usually a complement to mobile phones, as you have to be outside the house in a way that is clearly visible to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap-year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with school dropouts, allowing them to take a year off before university without interfering with their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can increase the chances of returning to higher education in your home country.
Generally, tuition fees are payable to enroll in these academic programs.
"Finland is a great place for boating. The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands in its lakes and offshore islands".
You don't need a yacht in the islands and lakes.
The coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, small boat or kayak, however.
Boating is a national delight in Finland, with every seven to eight people getting a boat.
This matches Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
The most distinctive feature of the Baltic cruise is the greater stay in Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the entire historic city for a few days and sleep in the ship on the way back at night.
If you are going to the coast only by pleasure cruise ship, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises put Berlin, Germany in the brochure. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or they have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no shame in it: It's no different from the personal fear and dislike of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens in flight may help them to overcome fears that are based on something unknown or beyond their control.
Courier companies are paid a good amount of money to deliver items quickly. Often, time is very important for urgent repairs, professional documentation, goods or spare parts.
On some routes, big companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies that was a problem.
If they were to send goods by air freight, it would have taken days for unloading and going through customs on some routes.
The only way to speed it up was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, no matter where you're coming from.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a thick bundle of money for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay the usual economy fare of four lots for business and eleven lots for first class!
Generally, it makes no sense to look for discounts for business or first class seats on a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group that wants to pay the top dollar for fast and comfortable travel, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994 the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova. It has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts were re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 30.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center, surrounded by a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide lanes, fronted glass buildings and modern shopping centre are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th century markets and old mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
Views of the nearby island of Istria can be seen from the village of Halderskvik and there is an octagonal extraordinary church.
Some of the graves in the churchyard have interesting marble statues of pigeons.
It takes about half an hour to walk around this fascinating village.

The Scooterbus 403 stops at Cabo de Roca and goes to Sintra on a regular basis.
Also visit the Great Sanctuary of Fatima in the north, a place of Marian spirituality famous worldwide.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave site, as well as visiting a site that contains a significant proportion of the world's population that is almost uncounted.
Many men and women are still alive here, and many others have been killed or died in the line of duty, including Jews and Greeks alike.
Please treat the site with the utmost dignity, thoughtfulness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not defuse the site by scratching to mark the graffiti in the structure.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most people understand it and almost all know Spanish.
However, most signs are only displayed in Catalan as it is established by law as the first official language.
Still, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and uncivil.
"While this is largely just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is to be on your best behavior, behaving like someone ""bien élevé"" (well-bred). That would make living much easier".
The outward effrontery of the Parisian will quickly evaporate if you display some basic discretion.
Plitvice National Park has dense forests, with predominantly beech, spruce and fir trees and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
It has a particularly diverse flora community due to its microclimate, different soil and different levels of altitude.
The area is also home to a rich diversity of animal and bird species.
There are also rare fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
Women have to wear skirts that cover the knees and cover their shoulders while visiting the monasteries.
In most monasteries, women who come unprepared are given a dress, but if you bring your own, and that too is a dress of a bright color, you will be greeted with a smile by the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men have to wear pants that cover the knees.
These clothes can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but they are not washed after each user's use so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan dishes, such as Mediterranean bread are based on vegetables and meat (especially pork), and use olive oil.
Especially in summer, a simple popular dinner is the pa'am om oli: bread with available ingredients such as olive oil, tomatoes and other cheeses, tunafish, etc.

So, by reading this grammar introduction you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and will be able to understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, those who know some Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is so close that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are not commonly used today and exist only as museums or places of learning.
Because light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes have large facilities in remote areas with favorable climates.
The practice of watching cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept actually came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor for himself only, and for other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
"Plants look best in natural environments, so resist the temptation to remove the ""only 1"" pattern".

Christmas is one of the most important holidays for Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holidays have been adopted by pagans in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is traditional to wake up on Easter night in an open stage to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there is a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but it may have been a rite before the Christian spring and fertility rites.
More traditional churches hold Easter vigils on Saturday nights during the Saturday-Saturday Vigil of Easter, with congregations often joining in the celebration to celebrate Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
The long distance from this continent meant that mammals could not travel, and the giant tortoise is the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This gives a good chance to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark almost all the time.
These areas are sparsely populated and so light pollution is not often a problem, so you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work-culture is more orderly and methodical than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are common professional attire and co-workers call each other by their name or by their rank.
Harmony is essential in the workplace, where the emphasis should be on team effort rather than individual achievements.
