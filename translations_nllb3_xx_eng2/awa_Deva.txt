This has long been known. This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, but also details the fact that fossils generally do not reproduce colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists have described the animal as having a pale-brown plumage above and a yellow or carotenoid plumage below.
This finding explains the evolution of wings in birds.
This is because the dinosaur wing did not have a well defined shaft called a "rachis", but other features of the wing were found. The Barbs and Barbules researchers hypothesized that the "rachis" were likely to have evolved at a later time and had these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were used not in flight but for temperature regulation or demonstration. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, this specimen shows adult wings, not a mammal.
The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings, not those of a mammal.
Two police officers were killed and more than twenty people were injured in a car bomb explosion at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning.

They found that the Sun moved on the same basic principle as other stars: the motion of all the stars in the system was governed by their luminosity, not their rotation.
Both luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rosby number of a star that is related to its plasma flux.
The smaller the Rosby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic flux.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made with the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team sought was caused by the tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon produces a pull on the Earth, the tides produce a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
The theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is contained in a type of halo around a galaxy, and is composed of many smaller particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview he said that the new variant was "much more troubling and dangerous because of the much higher mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients at the hospital may have come in contact with the bacteria, and at least two of them were hospital health workers.
One infected person can infect 10 to 15 other people in a year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa have the disease.

The government has also pledged several million vials of the encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
This year, plans to distribute vaccines to the most affected areas historically were delayed due to lack of funds and relative low priority for other diseases.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-technology one. Voters go to a booth alone and put a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope that represents the candidate of their choice.
After the identity of the voter is verified by the authorities, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law strictly follows the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been made transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the beginning of voting and no envelope is put in place other than the one duly counted and authorized by the voter.
Candidates may send representatives to watch every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy surveillance, following specific procedures.

Although three people were inside the house when the car collided, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the emergency services pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Edenbrook Hospital, Cambridge.
Adkoya has since been charged with the murder of her son in Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could have been tampered with as his photographs have been widely published.
This is common in the UK but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have ruled that publication of the photographs is potentially harmful.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: "Journalists are walking a dangerous path by publishing photos of suspects, etc".
The Crown Office, which is overall in charge of the prosecution, indicated to the journalist that no further comment would be made, at least until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document would mention the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
After an agreement is signed, Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the Valley for ten years, while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
In the supplementary pest control trial the shooters were to be monitored by rangers, as the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., the Sporting Shooters Association recruited qualified volunteers under its Hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks conservation and heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly will be sworn in to a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) on Monday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to take the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Since 2011, violent protests have erupted occasionally due to the failure to hold elections.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod malfunctions, with a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company did not consider serious.
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The quake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Authority said there were no reports of any casualties anywhere in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken hostage a bus hijacked by Hong Kong tourists in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the protesters.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead.
The six hostages, children and elderly, were released early. They were photographers from the Philippines.
In Badwa, photographers found an elderly mother who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm labor pains in her spare time.
His research showed that if regulated, one hormone would accelerate the development of the fetal lung.
According to Xinhua, government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Luna was the first queen of Extreme, our first manager", said Tommy Dreamer. "Luna died two moons ago. She was a very unique woman".
Dustin "Goldie" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as we are...maybe even more so...to love her and miss her...hopefully she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that her mandate was that Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the final poll, 29% of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had swum the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints led to doubts about her fitness.
They are unable to take medication to relieve their pain because medication is prohibited by the sport.
Mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri Curtis Cooper discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software by early February and announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of organic matter as well as a supply of water on Earth that could have made proteins and supported life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, since comets have been impacting Earth for millennia.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described the rumours as "political nonsense and idiocy".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims allows aircraft to fly on short routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and cut carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology to replace older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately detect aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is provided and no overground trains stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of transport shortages increased the likelihood that team supporters would have to play games behind closed doors without being forced to.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the origin of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process takes longer due to cross-breeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortressus, and a migrant cactus finch, Geospiza conyrostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. One can be rolled into a small size.
It can be drawn on a thin wire, which can be twisted and plated. It can be stamped or turned into sheets.
It could be made very thin, and then glued to other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The chemicals change color depending on how acidic or alkaline the cabbage juice is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons with scattered electrons (since the hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Stir two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture in your hand will react with the outer layer, which looks strange and thus forms a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjodaro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the toilet was sometimes part of a public bath used by both men and women together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it almost instantly.
Satellites are launched into space by a rocket. Scientists used telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 100 feet high is required to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing it did for us was it made transportation faster and easier.
This gave us trains, cars and many other transportation tools.
Below them were the more medium-sized cat which preyed on creatures ranging from rabbits to deer and deer to medium-sized animals.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) which prey on small organisms such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is a trait that every cat possesses that allows it to compete with other organisms.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult males, and a total of thirty females and juveniles.
Females generally mingled more than males because of a large family of sisters and sons.
A lion herd is largely a herd of wolves or dogs that are remarkably similar to lions (but not other large cats), and are very aggressive towards their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, Tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull up to five times the strength of a stronger human.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars are all in the panther genus. In the cat genus, only four of these can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather a phrase of a harsh, shouted word.
Oselot liked to eat small animals. He caught monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the animals Oselot hunted were much smaller than he was.
Scientists believe that the Oselots pursued the animals (the prey) and took prey by smell, sniff, or when they were on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision and can move very stealthily. Oselots are predators that blend in with their surroundings.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from its main population (e.g., move to a mountain range or river, or move to a new island and cannot easily return from there), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population requires different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than before.
The native populations have not changed at all, they still need adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look different from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, these two populations will appear so different that they cannot be considered one species.
This process is called speciation, which means the creation of new species. Speciation is an essential process and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produced the oxygen that humans breathe, and they took in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain their food from the sun and provide shade through photosynthesis.
We build our homes with plants and we make clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals cannot live without plants.
Mosasaurus was the greatest hunter of his time, so he feared no one but the other Mosasaurus.
It had more than 70 pointed teeth on its long jaw, and a single set on the upper part of its mouth, meaning that anything that came in its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it is possible that the same tongue was spiny. The same diet included turtles, giant maggots, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It attacked anything that entered the water; not even giant dinosaurs like the T. rex could resist it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate strange and unusual things as food, including wild boar, deer, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that where the poor and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to eat together, where they ate in groups.
Ancient Roman cuisine may not have included the foods that would have been brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted Turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
The people were sacrificing to the deity and the priests were trying to satisfy the needs of the deity through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped minarets, called ziggurats, were built to form part of the temple.
The top of the minaret was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not as important.
The Hebrew family spent most of its life outdoors.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; shops were open as counters that looked out onto the street. Stone was used to build houses.
The country lacked large forests, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But before its discovery, the Eskimo tribe had already been settled.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasures, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although the document has an inscription on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The reverse of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". This appears on the bottom of the Declaration document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (it measures 293‚ÅÑ4 inches x 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was used for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added as a mere label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting liberated the north of France, but not the south.
It was ruled by the "Wichy" French. It was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them rather than fighting the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in an invasion dubbed "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing on Germany.
A civilization is a distinctive culture shared by a significantly larger group of people who live, work, and worship together, called a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means citizen, from civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or state. It defines the shape of society as a whole.
A civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge across generations, a cultural footprint, and equitable diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - in which the Congress was the only component under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to tax, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state officials, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
It had no authority to override inter-state tax laws and duties.
The amendment of the article required the consensus of all the states and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international sports and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" because of the grouping of islands that make up the country.
Taiwan was first settled in the 15th century, with European sailors naming the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan that began a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the campus have been reconstructed to give tourists a sense of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and reconstruction continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today but the main difference is that the same orientation ratio is taken by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
This is why the orientation ratio of this format (when divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) have the same or nearly the same aspect ratio as this orientation.
The fundamentally controversial and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline creating dynamics by taking into account the scale of the system in the image.
According to this rule the most appropriate place for the main subject is at the partition point of the line dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Christianity had bound many European states together for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipotence affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the major Christian doctrines is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary fund is specifically for this purpose.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years. Such power and wealth led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The tactic proved effective, cutting off significant military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by many international agreements of the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire stretch of the sea, which also posed a threat to neutral shipping.
Since the response to this strategy was limited, Germany expected a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and the nation were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations expressed a desire to avoid such situations again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He had 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison to Charles Bachelors (his manager at his previous job) to get to the US.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
There was also a period of instability with provinces divided between each dynasty at the same time. The most famous of this period was the Three Kingdoms era which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period there was fierce warfare between several kingdoms vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people killed for the highest seats in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences such as the adoption of the metric system, republicanism from absolutism, the shift to nationalism, and the belief that a country is the income of its people, and not the product of a single ruler.
However, after the revolution, businesses were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious to succeed.
The same process applies to the military, as the ranking of the military is now based on merit instead of class.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He frequently visited a cave known as the "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) for meditation.
The cave has long been lively, and gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if one knows it exists; once inside a cave it is completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen above except the clear, beautiful sky and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Upper Egypt, contains many pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), many smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "upper arrow" sign looks like a V, and the "lower arrow" sign looks like a staple or a square that disappears downward.
Up means you start at the top and push the bow, down means you start at the bottom (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The up-bow typically produces a softer sound, while the down-bow is stronger and more vocal.
You can mark your own with pencil, but remember that the printed bow marks are for better musical reasons, so usually they should be played accordingly.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young boys (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a female mob from the market.
In a carriage, he returned to Paris. This carriage was surrounded by people who were shouting against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the window of their carriage open.
At one point a man in the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
He was forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and to pay interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous gains derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the core gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The period during which these events occurred, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE), is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the High Middle Ages, ending in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-pushed or technological imperatives to the strict sense that human destiny is intrinsically linked to scientific laws and their expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond large-scale cultural or political influence, and that technology must have an "impact" on society at large rather than a social effect on technology.
For example, one might say that the motor car inevitably led to the development of the road.
However, a nationwide road network was not economically viable for just a few cars, so new methods of production were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Large-scale car ownership led to more accidents on the roads, which led to the invention of new technologies in health care to repair damaged organs.
Sanitarianism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fitch, and Schlegel.
In the context of hygienism, geography influenced people, and over time customs and cultures related to geography emerged, and these, due to the conformity of the society to the place, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century there was a decline in its status, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine market could offer.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the styles in the West may have lagged 25 to 30 years behind.
Western Europe began to develop its own style in the late Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of the period as a result of the Crusades was the introduction of the use of buttons to fasten cloth.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is only used to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and organic system that uses preserved seeds of native habitat in conjunction with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, race, class, location/gender.
The characteristics that uniquely determine a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including metaphors and logic.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite some unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, and unfortunately or through intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "wild". Some wild children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of children by parents has resulted in the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may experience severe child abuse or trauma before they are left alone or they run away.
Others are accused of having raised animals; some are said to have lived alone in the woods.
When introduced from amongst completely non-human animals, feral children exhibit behavior almost exclusively of special care animals in behavior (within physical limits), such as fear of humans or being separated from humans.
While project-based learning should make teaching easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
The scaffold is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that provides support for people who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but the small paperclip in Microsoft Office is.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and are there to question, point to, and explain processes that might be challenging for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care in a variety of situations ranging from neglect to abuse and even forced removal.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system provides a safe home, loving, caring, stable education, and reliable health care.
Parenting care is expected to meet all the needs that are lacking in the home from which they came.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The Internet is taken in additional dimensions in terms of specific features, usage and view of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Individual engagement" and "continuous connection" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eghamy and McCord (1998), when they examined audience response to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries, useful in reading facial expressions, facial activity that is completed in a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can correctly interpret a statement for months to determine whether or not someone is lying.
Oliver Sacks in his article The Presidential Speech indicates that many people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still make accurate assessments of honesty.
We also suggest that this ability to explain human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century suggested that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden variation in one group and visible variation in the other.
Mutations add new genetic variation and selection removes the expressed variation from the group.
Isolation and recombination in each generation re-shaped the diversity between the two groups.
Outside of the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino-acid requirements from plant-based resources available to them.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences such as developmental depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources are proteins in the leaves and fruit, but for primates like us these are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, quail, egg) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not wonder if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short (10-60 minutes) period.
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you reset your watch before you go to sleep, you may want to put the watch on the other side of the bed, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other daily cycle-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress on his body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the vitality. Everyone has the potential to find total peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the various techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
Along with Kundalini Yoga, the yoga of Kundalini energy (knowledge energy) is awakened by various postures, breathing exercises, mantras and philosophies.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is dev yoga. Through the philosophy of various deities, energy veins are cleansed, chakras are activated and knowledge consciousness is built.
Germany was a public enemy in World War II, and cooperation between the USSR and the USA increased. When the war ended, many countries were divided by conflicts of systems, procedures, and cultures.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
The war lasted for the next 40 years and was fought in real time on the battlefields of Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places, through the pseudo-army.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken. The only hope left was to retreat and regroup near the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Red Army invaded the eastern territories of Poland and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of watercraft is still the most efficient method for transporting goods and moving large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its own people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of WWII. The Americans were attempting to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean in support of Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy used mostly U-boats to try to block this route.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have been able to conquer Britain because it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep goats for their milk, hair, meat, and skins for easy access.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks. The herding goats were accompanied by a herd of sheep, often with children or adolescents who followed the herdsmen's trail. The herders were more broadly known as shepherds.
Wagonways (ways for four-wheeled carriages) were built in England in the early 16th century.
However, the wagonway was built with only a wooden parallel plank to allow horses to gain more speed and to pull more loads more easily than the slightly more rugged roads of the time.
The use of railings to hold tracks in place was introduced much earlier. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if iron rails were placed on top of these rails.
This became common, but the iron caused the wagons to have too much friction on the wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first railway made entirely of iron was introduced.
The first known transport was walking. Humans began to walk upright around two million years ago, when Homo erectus (i.e. upright man) emerged.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, was not usually walking straight.
Bipedal specialization has been found in the fossil of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 Ma, although Sahelthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
We can start to be more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and become activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is similar to treating the symptoms of a disease in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind. The problems caused by overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of mankind have become more and more serious.
After it was adopted by the Congressmen on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlop's printing shop a few blocks away.
Overnight 150 to 200 copies were produced, which are known today as "Dunlop Broadsides".
John Nixon first publicly read the document in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, and he read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 copies of Dunlop Broadside that are known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the documents. However, the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived on Earth for a long time and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have shells and claws on their legs. They all lay eggs and move like T. rex with the help of their hind legs.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the exchange of information, and are encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
The poison may not be immediately apparent when it is spread through the body. Symptoms such as vomiting are common and therefore diagnosis is not immediately possible in such cases.
The first cause of poisoning in the body may be an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for the required first aid instructions for the particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Assassin-bugs and bed-bugs are both nidicoluses, meaning that they can both live in their host's nest or habitat.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system. The central nervous system is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that child custody is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
This couple may choose to plan for their child's adoption.
After adoption, the birth parents lose their parental rights so that the adoptive couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which is the basis for most scientific research.
Although not the only one, an experiment is a test used to test one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observing are also important in scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West itself lost touch with the Greek philosophical and scientific foundations.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often significantly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic resonance rhythms that are not simply responses to external periodic signals have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, trees, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to measure the period of an independently occurring cyclic process even in the absence of external cues.
One of the key suggestions of the Hershey and Chaz experiment was that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
We conducted two experiments involving the labeling of DNA with phosphorus radioactivity or proteins with sulfur radioactivity.
The mutation can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, with the amount of genetic material affected being of great importance.This determines whether the affected cells are cells of the germline or not.
Mutations in cells of the genome alone can lead to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the natural landscape including flora, fauna, and wildlife.
As a form of activity in nature-based tourism, places include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, in addition to studying information about the ecosystems.
For example, traveling to Borneo is about learning, photographing, and learning about the orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to their workplace. At this time, others pass by, whose workplace is the same one that the elderly have just left.
This dynamic transport is associated with the automobile in some form and supports transport systems based on private cars.
Science tells us that this vast carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
All people in society participate and use transportation systems. However, almost all people complain about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why are such complaints often found in transportation systems? Why do they fail on a daily basis? Is this just because of useless transportation engineers? Or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally drive within certain limits, so there is some reasonable consistency in traffic flow and this can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better describe traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
This relationship helps in planning, designing and operating road-related facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly allows them to more easily avoid enemies, obtain food, and more efficiently find mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back parallel to their bodies.
This gives them many small hiding places from predators.
Today, the dragonfly is the only insect that can fly without folding its wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the sun revolved around the solar system.
Some believe that he was right. Others, on the contrary, believe that the solar system (including the sun and other planets) revolves around the earth.
This makes sense because the Earth doesn't appear to be spinning, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It has 8 times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world. It is sometimes up to six miles wide.
About 20% of all water flowing from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon alone.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
However, stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, when the size and construction of the Giza Pyramids were surpassed by the technological excellence of the pyramids of Giza.
Ancient Egyptians were amazed to see ancient monuments, built by their ancestors over a thousand years ago, in the New Kingdom.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest, most independent and least populous country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian for its laws and official communication.
Italian is the language used in everyday life by the majority of the working people in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they can be found naturally in nature. They are easier to find with older tools.
The philosopher Aristotle taught that everything in the universe was composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These four states of matter were solid, liquid, gas, and plasma (in the same order), but he also theorized that they could be converted into new substances to make what we see.
An alloy is essentially an alloy of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals; of course, silver and gold are also metals.
You can also have an EC alloy that has a small amount of an element added, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could exist by the end of this sentence.
Similarly, when the pencil was invented, it was a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing came into existence, the pencil was used less and less.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, so they never have to go to the sharpener.
It is only conceivable that something new will happen to the keyboard.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is required to hold many protons and neutrons together in the nucleus.
Just as it takes energy to pull a heavy vehicle up a hill, now by refracting the nucleus some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no force.
The Moon's surface is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The near side of the crust is about 70 km thick and the far side is 100 km thick.
It is thick beneath the Maria Peninsula and the Highlands.
Due to the thinner crust, there may be more lava in the surrounding area, making it easier for the lava to rise above the surface.
The theory of satisfaction focuses on finding out what people want and what they demand from people.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and wants. As people age, their needs and wants change dramatically.
These theories can be used to understand the behavior of particular people, such as what they like to do and what they do, and what factors in their environment motivate them to do or not do certain things.
Two of the most famous satisfaction theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two types of behavior that emerge when managers take over from their former colleagues: On one end of the spectrum are some employees who want to do what they were doing before.
This may include managers having difficulty making tough decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, there are people who make changes themselves. Older people feel that they should do everything that the team does and adopt what is important to them.
After all, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often causes friction between the team leader and the rest of the team.
Influential team members are held to the same good standards as traditional team members but there are subtle differences.
Influential team members often serve as contact points for their immediate outside group.
Influential teams may have members in different time zones, so influential team members typically have more authority than members of traditional teams. However, they are not considered to be of high importance by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of the effective team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization go through the time spent in the process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and agility can be communicated across functional departments of an organization if all available resources are used effectively.
Consequently, the process of organizations working together to overcome any barriers to meeting customer needs can lead to a new innovation process.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must build a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains that the continuum approach is a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of the theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition, thus making this field of research less rigorous and more precise.
The links between brain pathology and behavior help scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
With the help of new technologies, it is now possible to see the structure and function of the brain more easily and to perform more detailed brain imaging.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build models of human simulation, which can be used to better understand the processes of the brain.
However, AI is also important in the world of science, as AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science. Its function is to read behavior, learn and assume intelligence in machines.
AI research involves building machines that require the behavior of intelligence, in order to automate such tasks.
This includes, for example, controlling, planning, and scheduling, responding to customer inquiries and troubleshooting, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Now such things have become a separate discipline that focuses on solving real-life problems.
AI systems are often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, in much the same way that many home computer and video game software applications are used.
Regional excursions are important for any class. Usually, students are taken to places where they have no option of traveling by bus.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, and admire fine art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a good way to give feedback on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned each year. However, older versions are put online to serve as scrapbooks.
Students can improve their writing through blogs. Usually when students start their blogs they have a lot of grammar and spelling mistakes. However, with the help of audience feedback they keep improving.
Students are often considered the best audience, so bloggers often start to improve their writing in advance to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become knowledgeable about the world around them. Students also have to work hard to create blogs that are easily liked by the audience. This process of making blogs interesting, motivates students to be clever creatives (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical. Students can express their thoughts about other people's writing by commenting on Internet content, as well as outlining their own point of view on particular issues (Orewek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful and bilingual capital city. It is home to a series of art galleries and museums that tell the story of Canada's past and present.
Canada's far south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is Moscow and the surrounding areas of outstanding natural beauty.
Because of all these things and more, Ontario is known, to outsiders, as one of the best places in Canada.
Further north large areas are heavily populated with camels. In addition, some areas are virtually uninhabited forests.
This comes as a surprise to many when comparing the population. There are more African-Americans living in the United States than citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the island. It spread to the Comoros and Maite on a large scale.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama explored the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
It is recommended that any female passenger, regardless of actual marital status, state that she is married.
Wearing a ring (not just the expensive one) is also helpful.
Women should realize that it may be a result of cultural differences that they perceive as a form of harassment. Chasing, holding hands, etc. is not uncommon.
Men are encouraged to be firm and not be afraid to stand their ground (whether or not there are cultural differences does not make it right!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anafa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as the wine El-Badja. It was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to do shopping in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling a whole range of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hooks and gigos, around the old medina, but these are for tourists.
D√¥me, near Rwanda, is a tourist town in the Republic of the Congo to the far east.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, burying many of the city's main streets and the city centre.
Goma is very safe. Goma must be searched for to get out so that the situation of the fighting in North Kivu province is understood.
The town is also the base for the climb of Nyiragongo volcano, supporting Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla trail.
To get to Goma, a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used. The usual price for a short distance is ~500 Congolese francs.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for unusual and remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination. It has an airport.
The desert sands were added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is quite different from the rest of the country in that it has an African rather than an Arab character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It extends to the border with Mozambique in the east, to the border with Zimbabwe in the north, and to the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each one sheltering different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered to be the precursor of the South African National Parks (Sanparks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entry fees to visit the park.
Buying a wild card can also be beneficial to anyone who is granted entry to a selected park in South Africa or to any of the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a major tourist attraction.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a magnificent bar chart illustrated by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, head to the Kowloon Waterfront, opposite the island of Nial.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
It is the site where the British colonialists adopted and that is why it is a good place to go if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian interior.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian Territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just mangrove swamps, however - it contains some of the last remnants of the mighty forest that was once found on the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is in water/swamp zone.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 cheetah deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses traveling from one district to another are often crowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are an easy and comfortable means of traveling to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 m high, it is 378 m long and has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be finished.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsisted on subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicur and the Payahuas, who made their living by gathering game and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the wars of the Spanish conquistadors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Field in Las Canitas.
Other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here.
For news of the tournament and information on buying tickets to polo matches, see Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which is set at a value equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island which is located in Stanley at the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island. In addition, Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United Kingdom currency may be accepted. Ask the owner first to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the island, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is hot when winter is in the Northern Hemisphere and cold when summer is in the Southern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures over +30¬∞C are common.
Winters are typically quite severe: temperatures do not quickly drop below zero, but air and moisture mix to make temperatures feel colder than they are on a thermometer.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, be at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals.
No matter how tame they appear, they can attack bison, elk, moose, bear, and almost any large animal.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so let them stay in their place.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid transporting or cooking smelly foods and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of some 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasi Liloufi III.
Auckland's two harbours are spread out due to the many beaches. The most popular of the three areas is one of the Bay of Islands.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor District) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most are shaded by Pohuatauqua trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Wetamata Harbour, in the upmarket suburb of Mission Bay, and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a variety of shops on the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Other local beers are called "manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're nervous it's easy to find bottled water.
The idea of 'plain white' coffee is foreign to Australians. There is a small black 'espresso', comes in a high stack with cappuccino cream (not yoghurt), and is served with tea without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. The functional juices are expensive but excellent.
Many visits to the reef are made throughout the year, and it is rare for a reef to be injured by an echidna.
However, consult with the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found from October to April near the coast and river mouths north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of this time.
Sharks do exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to run away from the shore.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat being the estuary of the North River from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep after they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through your travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or combined flight and hotel packages to India.
They may reserve a reservation for you if you need time to think about your offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any amendments or requests should be made first through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the concert-goers would camp on the grounds, and most people considered it an important part of the experience.
If you wanted to be close to one, you had to go fast to get close to a camping site.
Keep in mind that even if the music ends on the main stage, there may be some parts of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as there is a lot of noise for people most affected by crossing the ice.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time to visit the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. They usually have no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to get out.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them on campus.
Some venues offer alcoholic drinks. However, drinking interferes with judgment, and not all good gamblers know the importance of not getting drunk.
Anyone who is going to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, or icy temperatures.
On a snowy road, friction is less and you cannot drive on it as you would on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, large amounts of snow may fall in a short period of time.
Visibility may be restricted by falling or flying snow, or by condensation of snow on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, in many countries the situation is normal, and traffic runs mostly non-stop throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and is a draw for many tourists.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips underground to observe the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, can be observed closely by approaching the car and using standard equipment.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a "busch walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a long hike of either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964, is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a difficult situation.
The rules for cancellations vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellations by the end of March do not move forward to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¬•7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Iron and ironing boards are available for loan at many hotels, even if none are present in the room.
If ironing is not available, or if you do not like to wear ironing socks, you can use a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the clothing (which may shrink, or burn if overheated).
There are many methods of water purification, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others it may take several minutes.
Filter effectiveness varies, and if you have any concerns, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests with which they are not familiar.
Insects can spoil food, cause allergies, or worse than yeast, cause allergies, spread toxins, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans, are generally not considered pests.
In some places, duty free shopping is a great opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on items such as alcohol and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is very difficult to drive, as it passes through several different wilderness areas.
If you are not used to driving on the roads of this country, be extra careful on steep grades, narrow streets and dangerous bends.
The prescribed speed limit is considerably lower than in the preceding and following sections - typically the speed limit is 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is important to adhere to it strictly.
Interestingly, mobile phone service is much better here than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, like in their southern neighbor, Austria, are quite rich and varied.
Fruit pastry is common, apples are cooked in pastry all year round, and cherries and plums are available during the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, mountain almonds and other almond tree nuts. The best cake that is Wohma is often combined with a cup of strong coffee, especially well.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the pastries of the Berliner, Pafank√ºchen or Kraffen regions.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of water.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that includes a huge variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifier, the term basically means the cuisine of the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of simply seasonal dishes, the major Javanese flavors are peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The rider's feet are supported by the rope, which hangs on both sides of the pole.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his feet get caught in the bridle, they may be dragged away when the horse runs away. Several safety precautions may be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wore a heel and a smooth, rather narrow, riding boot.
In addition, some sleds, notably the English sled, had safety belts that would allow a rider to fall off the leather sled if the falling rider was pulled backwards.
Coachamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its variety of granite big walls and crags.
The summit offers breathtaking views from the top of the mountain. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes amidst the endless potential of a wall.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which skiers or snowboarders slide down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to their feet.
