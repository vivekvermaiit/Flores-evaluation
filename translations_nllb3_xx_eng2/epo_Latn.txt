And one antibody cocktail, ZMapp, has initially shown some promise in the field, but formal studies indicate that it's actually less effective than we'd like to think in preventing death.
In a PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a benchmark to compare three other treatments with.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the USOC and recognizes that the Olympic family clearly needs to develop a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the UOK statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and also their sport, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, rather than by depriving them of a certificate.
USA Gymnastics is supporting an independent investigation that could shed some light on how the abuse of the scale, so boldly described by Larry Nassar's survivors, could have gone unnoticed for so long, and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the UOK share the same goal  to make the gymnastic sport, and the other, as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widespread theory, but it also provides details that the fossil record cannot provide, like color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was a dark brown with pale or carotenoid-colored undersides.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed stalk, called a rakia, but they did have other features of feathers  branches and twigs  the researchers concluded that the rakia was probably a later evolutionary development than those other features.
Based on the structure of the feathers, it is assumed that they were not used for flight, but more likely for heat regulation or for display. The researchers speculated that the specimen shows adult plumage and not a lanugoid, although it is a tail of a young dinosaur.
The researchers speculated that the specimen shows adult plumage and not the fur of an iodine, although it is a tail of a young dinosaur.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team looked for the effect that the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter would have.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that the darkest matter around a galaxy surrounds it like a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the power plant.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very disturbing and alarming because it has a very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have been infected with the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two of them are health workers in the hospital.
During a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 others.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of TB patients seems to be negligible; 6,000 of the total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

They are colder than the surrounding surface, by day and warmer by night.
"Their temperature behavior is not as stable as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with those that are deep cavities in the ground", said Glen Cushing of an astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a technologically simple experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put the pre-printed sheet of paper with an indication of their preferred candidate in an envelope.
Once officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, polling stations must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that there are no envelopes before the start of the election and that no envelopes are added except those of the orderly counted and entitled voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each stage of the process.

Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has remained in Edinburgh Sheriff Court ever since, accused of murdering his son.
She is being held in custody pending formal indictment and trial, but any testimony by a witness can be affected, as her image has been widely circulated.
It's common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, and courts consider publication of photos potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists do seem to be approaching a dangerous line if they publish photos or other details of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, clarified to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is made.
The document, according to the leak, will reference the border dispute that Palestine wants to have based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics of concern, it is said, will include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to leave the presence for only five years.
The shooters in the auxiliary pest control experiment had to be closely monitored by the foresters while the experiment was being studied and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are being recruited as part of the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four selected for the first firing operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's first CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP's resignation as part of a measure to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by the failed organization of elections, some of which were postponed from 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating from malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEKI) reported that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, MEKI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 new incidents of overheating, which the company calls "minor".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' office of emergency management said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage, seizing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been released and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed his father's example and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as a obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that hormone release accelerated the maturation of fetal lung in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night of two moons. Quite unique, like herself. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those in the poll share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints raised doubts about his ability.
He could not take the medication needed to treat his pain because it is forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known today on January 25.
A few people confirmed the discovery, using various devices and software, all the way to the early days of February, and it was declared on Tuesday.
Comets may eventually be a source of water supply for Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets began colliding with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and to give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is operated, and the overground trains do not stop at Wembley, no parking lots or parking-and-drive facilities are found in the area.
Fears of transportation shortages increased the likelihood that the game would be played behind closed doors, without any team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have told us that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process probably took longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's fringes, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus fringes, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into a wide variety of shapes. It can be rolled into thin shapes.
You can pull it to make a thin wire that can be folded and braided, you can hammer it, you can roll it into a sheet.
You can make it very thin and stick it to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using beet juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been deprived of their electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
Wet on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel weird and form a shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a water-spray toilet in almost every house, connected to a complicated sewer system.
Remains of gutterwork have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in a mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and reflects it down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
You need a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing that the wheel has made possible is providing a much easier and faster transportation.
Because of it, we have a train, a car, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are more moderate cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including homeless pet cats) that eat the much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is a concept of the niche, a specialization that every cat retains, so they don't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, they live in groups called herds.
A flock consists of one to three related adult males and many to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds function quite similarly to wolf or dog herds, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to the prey.
A very athletic and harmonious animal, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump at great distances and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar, but more like a phrase of hoarse, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds whenever possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find edible animals (prey) by smell, sniffing the tracks on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very inconspicuously. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the surroundings and then jumping on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) splits from the main population from which it originated (such as if they cross a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to, in order to be a strong competitor, have different characteristics or adaptations than those they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, as thousands or even millions of years pass, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants make the oxygen that people breathe in, and they take away the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetation. Without vegetation, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the tallest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in its mouthpiece, meaning that nothing that hit it could escape.
I'm not sure, but it may have had a bipedal tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water, so even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus wouldn't have a chance against it.
While we would recognize most of their food, the Romans did have their own set of strange or unusual festive items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the glire.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, rich men liked to have parties together, where they rested on their sides, eating their dishes.
Among the dishes of ancient Rome could not be foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctuary, which could only be entered by the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open sales desks facing the street. People used stone to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was driven from Iceland for murder, and on his way westward, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days of its existence the large parchment document (its dimension is 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for holding.
So probably the note was added just as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south still remained unfree.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, these were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture that is owned by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also defines the dimension of society in some way.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture implies a transmission of knowledge through a few generations, a lasting cultural trace and a fairly large dispersal.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving a relevant historical record and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government with a congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to collect taxes and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it entrusted the execution of its decisions to state agencies, which were often uncooperative.
Nor could it override the tax laws and customs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before any change, and states dealt with the central government so casually that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor sport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the composition/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, in a geographical sense, an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the indigenous ways of grain production and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces occupied western and northern border areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for shooting still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but, more importantly, its proportions were inherited from the sensitive formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide by 34 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (such as the APS format) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The much-insulted and often-laughed-at rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamism, holding a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, became the object of critical scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervasive power affected everyone from king to citizen.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist specifically for this purpose.
For over a thousand years the central authority of the Church was in Rome and this concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this dogma was obeyed.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade breached generally accepted international law codified by a number of international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain had fenced off international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since such a tactic had a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited military use of submarines.
During the 1912s the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid a recurrence of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at the previous workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of showing different time periods; each era in China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Also among all the dynasties was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of such periods was the Three Kingdoms Era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, fierce fighting took place among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the military, because instead of military ranks that were once based on class, they were now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside this everyday life. He frequented a cave that became known as Hiraj on Mount Noorj (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved through time, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists, and when you're in the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing else is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world is visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains a number of pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), a number of small tombs, a number of temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples many were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "arch up" mark looks like a V and the "arch down" mark like a bracket or a square without a bottom.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the heel (this is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow usually produces a more delicate sound, while the downward bow is stronger and firmer.
Don't hesitate to add your own markings with pencil, but remember that the printed arches are there for a musical reason, so usually they should be looked at.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Lady Elizabeth were brought back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of bazaar women on 6 October 1789.
They drove to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd, making noise and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, an amassé waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the frightened queen.
The military expenditures of the US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to compensate for a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds circulating in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banks.
Of course, the surplus profits derived from the vast exploitation of the Filipino people have been the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that helped to found the order.
The period in which the events take place is usually called the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which end by agreement around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice covers a wide range of ideas, from technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the evolution of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has on societies effects that are inherently specific, rather than socially conditioned.
One could say, for example, that the automobile necessarily led to the evolution of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being designed to lower the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken up by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, the geography shaped individuals and with the passage of time emerged customs and culture associated with that geography, and those, more harmonious with the location of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
In the 12th century its status was degraded mainly because the crusaders returned with silks and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine bazaars.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of communication, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major achievements of the period was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seeds native to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase a crop.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views, who feel ignored by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as a whole can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subcultures often mark their membership with a recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, affectation, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few unfortunate cases of children who, while growing up, due to neglect, bad luck or malicious mistreatment, were not socialized by adults.
Some children who have gone wild have been imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases such abandonment of a child has been due to the rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Children who have gone wild may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild on their own.
Raised only by nonhuman animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the framework of physical limitations) almost completely similar to those of the particular caretaker animal, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, and a teacher is a variant of a scaffold and the little clip in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffold is built into software and must ask, suggest and explain procedures that might be difficult for the learner if he acts on his own.
Children find themselves in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring and educational, and yet it happens.
We look at the foster care system as a safety zone for these types of kids.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care.
And the curator shall provide for them all things that were wanting in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet give an additional dimension to the use-reward theory.
For example, learning and socializing are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified personal engagement and lasting relationships as new motivational aspects when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech suggested that people who cannot understand speech due to brain trauma can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even assumes that such a capacity to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of observable variation.
Splitting and recombination remixes the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from available plants.
And failing to do so has grave consequences of growth retardation, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The easiest available plant resources would be proteins that can be obtained from leaves and beans, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain the essential amino acids.
So, considering all these things, it shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep cessation is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10×60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to regain consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be left on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which will make you get out of bed to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person has is negatively correlated with the degree of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is possible for everyone. The only obstacle on the way to this goal is your own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the divine yoga. By imagining various deities, one cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates the enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, a clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries' separation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would have real battles, with replacement armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was broken, the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions, breaking the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The job of a navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time impeding your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The most notable recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany could probably conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and furs.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in flocks roaming hills and other pastures, often tended by goatherds, who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherd.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although railway tracks were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
The spokes appeared early enough to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it became clear that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top.
This became a popular practice, but iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out more quickly.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation was by walking, humans began to walk vertically two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go vertically as often.
Two-legged specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthrops are believed to have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and we can even become activists to somehow reduce the future suffering.
This is like anti-symptomatic medication in many cases, but if we want not just a temporary fix, then we have to find the root cause of the problems and we have to deactivate them.
Of course, the world has been greatly changed by the scientific and technological achievements of mankind, and problems have been made greater by overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of mankind.
After the Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
In one night, they made between 150 and 200 copies, which are now known as "Dunlap's Posters".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on 6 July to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July, and a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap posters known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs, like a tyrannosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of a medication or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific toxin.
The term bug is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long-standing familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and caterpillars are nictitating, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child.
Such couples can choose to plan an adoption for their baby.
During an adoption procedure, the biological parents cease their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific research.
But it's not alone; it's also an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, questioning and observation are the guides of scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became evident as being disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms that do not simply respond to external periodic stimuli have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of repetitive autonomous functioning even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase were using bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the wrapped piece of genetic material, and whether the wrapped cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and take photos and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave towns by car to go to work, and are passed by others who are going to the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is somehow involved and contributing to a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has been sustaining human evolution for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you don't hear this level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems get these kinds of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict a driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform setup; so traffic flows tend to have some moderate uniformity and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent a traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them more easily avoid enemies and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the length of their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places against predators.
Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and ephemeris.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That made sense. Because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever succeeded in surpassing the pyramids of Giza in size and technical proficiency of their construction.
New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official relations.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements  such as gold, silver and copper  since antiquity, because these occur in nature in a basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter in the same order: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he continued to theorize that they become new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that are made up of small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into a dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good tool for a lot of people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing, the pencil fell out of favor and use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a slope, so splitting the nucleus, again, releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no touch.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the hidden side.
It is less thick under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side, because the crust is less thick. It was easier for lava to pour out to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people act or what challenges them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized during the process of maturation into adulthood.
These theories explore what it is about certain people, what makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to guide their former equals: One end of the spectrum is striving to remain one of the friends.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, assessing work efficiency, assigning tasks and demanding responsibility from people.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done before, and take ownership of it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often such behavior results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same high-quality standards as physical teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as a point of contact for their live physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may be misunderstood by their local administrators.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently across the functional divisions of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process when an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as of shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of effectiveness.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition. So it narrows the scope of the study and makes it more targeted.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior leads scientists to continue their research.
It's a long-known fact that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and alter some of the mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand what's going on in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction undertone, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from a client, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and warfare, and are also incorporated into some home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any teaching. Quite often a teacher would like to take his students to places that are not reachable by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a virtual trip is another great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, every year a new version of the website is released, but the old versions remain available for use as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing skills in students, and while students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students become more understanding of the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can enable learners to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, learners can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also outline their own view of certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada and it has a collection of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muscat and beyond.
These and other things make Ontario what outsiders think of as essentially Canadian.
Vast areas further north are rather sparsely populated, some being almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
This comparison of populations surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens combined.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is an independent continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or linked to France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region and it became deeply rooted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama initiated the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what one would consider to be chikan, and it is not uncommon to be followed, held in the arm, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with men's proposals and don't be afraid to back down (cultural or not, a difference is not necessarily to be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Benimerians as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them with the name Casa Branca, but they nevertheless left after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the sultan of Morocco under the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who set up trading posts there called it Casablanca.
In terms of shopping, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco.
Around the old city center it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajines, ceramics, leather goods, nargles and a whole range of glitter, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east next to Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, covering most of the city's streets with its magma, especially in the city center.
Goma offers adequate security, but one must inform oneself of every visit outside of it to know the status of the battles that are still taking place in the province of North Kivu.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano in addition to the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel through Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has become bored as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but it is a tourist attraction because of its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was inscribed on the red list of world heritage sites due to the threatening sands of the desert.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts with the rest of the country, as it has an Arab style rather than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe and south to the Crocrodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 separate ecozones, each supporting a different fauna.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most symbolic of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entry fees for the park.
It is also useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry, either to selected parks of South Africa, or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the most interesting.
The line of buildings that creates the Hong Kong skyline was compared to a shining histogram, which is evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross into the front, which is located off the coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban growth on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on land that has been reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the area that the British colonists claimed, and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start looking.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 mi) across the coast further into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just a mangrove swamp, however; it is home to some of the last refuges of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water or marshes.
In 1966 the Sundarbans became a nature reserve and it is estimated that in its territory there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer seen.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, but most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Since the inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are connected by miniature Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are fast and comfortable means of transport to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres wide and it has two corridors 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical under the bridge is 15 meters away. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the scheduled completion of the Brazilian customs crossings is completed.
The Guaraní were the most notable indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as quasi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived from hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as La Gran Provincia de las Indias, came into being as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began an era of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields at Las Cañitas.
Here you can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo for tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which has been pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outer islands they probably won't accept credit cards, but you can take British and American money; ask beforehand to find out which payment method is accepted.
Since it is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, change the money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere, while it is winter in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely freeze, but wind and humidity combine and therefore one feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no separate rainy and dry seasons: the rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to the presence of humans, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities ask that you stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they may seem, the bison, elk, deer, bear, and almost every other large animal is capable of attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't kept a proper distance. Since these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, keep their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the scene of the infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting at the town resulted in the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two harbours. The most popular are in three regions.
The beaches of Noth Shore (in the North Haven district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them have sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at the Waitemata Harbour in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches where shops line the shore in abundance.
The main local beer is Number One. It's not a sophisticated beer, but it's nice and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many good wines from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be better.
It is perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if you have concerns.
Australians are not familiar with the concept of flat white coffee. Espresso is short black, cappuccino is rich in cream (not foam) and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year there are many excursions to the reef and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, please follow the instructions of the authorities, follow all signals and safety warnings.
Cuboids appear near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the sea. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, but you may be able to book through such agents other types of accommodations, such as camping sites.
Travel agents generally provide plans that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation in case you need time to think about the offer or to get you other documents for the destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should, however, be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most of the attendees decide to camp on site and most consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to take a camping spot near the music.
Remember that the music on the main stages may have stopped, but there may be parts of the festival where it will be playing late into the night.
Some festivals provide special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are sailing the northern Baltic in winter, be careful about the cabin location, because going through ice causes quite a terrible noise in those most affected.
Cruise ships to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers on cruise ships are visa-free (check conditions).
Casinos normally make every effort to ensure that guests spend the maximum amount of their time and money. Windows and clocks are usually not present and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special foods, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to keep them inside.
Some places offer alcohol free, but drunkenness impairs mental capacity and every good player is aware of how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who will be driving a vehicle into high latitudes or across mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is low and therefore one cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, the amount of snow that can block you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow or wind, by condensation, or by ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari is popularly used to refer to a trip to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and ordinary tools provide good eyesight.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes show fear, so binoculars will help you see them better.
A walking safari (also called a Khamba march, Khamba safari, or Khamba walking) consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held between August 24 and September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Having hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the delay was announced, you're probably in a tough spot.
Cancellation policies are varied, but, in the case of late March, the majority of coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have ironing boards and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you might try using a dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause burn damage to it).
There are different means of purifying water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water is enough for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different efficiencies and, if you care about that, consider buying the water in a sealed bottle from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unknown in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or, worst of all, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or carry infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing a human being by force are generally not counted as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, sometimes passing through isolated forested areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be extra careful: steep slopes, narrow corridors, and winding turns are most common.
Signal speed limits are noticeably lower than those of the front and rear sections  often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and they are strictly adhered to, even more so than otherwise.
It is noteworthy that mobile phone service is nonetheless much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of its neighbor to the south, Austria.
There are many fruit pastries that contain apples all year round, and cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular pastries usually go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the ones called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry dish is a dish consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A core can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term covering a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without additional qualifying words, the term generally refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now readily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of spicy dishes, with the tastes favored by Javanese, namely peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Hanging from either side of the saddle, footrests serve as supports at the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can pose safety problems, as the rider's feet could eventually get caught in them.
If, while riding, you fall off a horse, your foot caught in a peg, you could be dragged by a horse that might run away. To minimize this risk, you can make various safety arrangements.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and sole that is smooth and fairly narrow.
Additionally, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rods such that a rider falling can pull back to detach a footrope from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing area in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer amazing views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes from the endless possibilities of the walls.
Downhill winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one slides down a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts who are known as ski junkies and who plan entire vacations based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to as early as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing is considered to have been a sport since at least the 17th century and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first leisure ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, but it usually does not involve them, because these latter take place on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as if it were a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover distances slightly greater than when walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy backpack on well-maintained roads.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel through several countries, one needs to repeat visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions in this respect as if it were one country.
Provided that you stay within this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport controls.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen country, which saves you time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what goods are antiques. Some tax agencies consider antiques to be goods that are more than 100 years old.
Because the definition varies from place to place, in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
So you could count handicrafts as antiques, even though they're newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding reindeer herding is important for many other crafts as well.
Even in tradition, not all Sami were engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they lived from fishing, hunting or something similar, using reindeer mostly as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people are employed in modern jobs.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially by non-Roma, it is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If a travel warning is issued against the country you're going to visit, it may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
It is also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, even though they are directed at their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East could find themselves in a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
A warning is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information one may have elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and consists of various types that depend on the location, the terrain and the atmospheric conditions.
Hurricane winds, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires are examples and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, thunderstorms and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather are blizzards, snowstorms, winter storms and sandstorms.
It is highly advisable that travelers be aware of all kinds of risks from severe weather that affects their area, as this can affect any travel plans.
Anyone visiting a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An internet search for a hostile media course will most likely show the address of a local business.
A course will generally cover much more in detail all the issues presented here, normally with practical experience.
One course will normally last 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines on survival in the wild, but there are few such works on war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents with them for return.
The willingness to issue passports without a gender (X) or updated documents matching a desired name varies from government to government.
Whether other governments are willing to accept these kinds of documents varies equally wildly.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 period.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to pass the scanner without their privacy and dignity being respected.
Surfing is the backward flow of waves that have broken off at a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Due to the diverse underwater formations, the retrograde flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections where a rapid flow to depth can occur.
Most of the deaths are caused by trying to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it should be.
Try to pick a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills or whether you've been noticed, you might prefer to wait to be rescued.
The return shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to the new culture sometimes have a particular difficulty in re-adapting to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your native culture.
When one first traveled abroad, people probably had patience and understanding, because they realized that travelers needed to adjust to the new country.
People may not foresee that patience and understanding are also needed with regard to travelers returning home.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children to do in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Here you will generally hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The roar of sound and light is just like a novel.
The sphinx is placed on the background and it is the narrator of a long story.
They project the scenes onto the pyramids and then they illuminate the different pyramids.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by a number of countries and they have the most bases, sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, on which is the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, whose flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a striking natural harbor.
Ellsworth County is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
After joining the plateau here, the peninsula's mountain range eventually reappears forming the Ellsworth mountain range, which is 360 kilometers long and is dried by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel mountain range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, whose highest peak Vinson is 4892 m high.
In remote areas without access to mobile phone network, satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because you have to be outdoors in clear view of a satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider may also provide you with further information about connecting to this service.
For those who plan a sabbatical year, it is becoming increasingly popular to travel and study.
This is especially popular among those who finish secondary school, because it gives them a year off before going to university, without risking their education.
In many cases, if you enroll in a one-year course abroad, it can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education when you return home.
There will normally be an entry fee to join these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the offshore archipelagos
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago or on the lakes.
While the offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually big enough for all types of yachts, smaller boats and even kayaking provide a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland: one in seven or eight Finns own a boat.
Such popularity is seen only in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is a rather unique statistic (for example in the Netherlands one in forty people own a boat).
The majority of the various Baltic cruise ships also include a stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can fully use a few days to visit the historic city, returning at night on the ship to sleep there.
If you disembark only by the cruise ships, a separate visa is not required (since 2009).
The brochures of some cruise ships include Berlin, Germany. As can be seen at the top of the map, Berlin is not near the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying on an airplane can be a frightening experience regardless of age and background, especially if you've never flown or if you've been through a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of; it's no different from the personal fears and dislikes that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome the fear that is based on not knowing or the fact that you have no control over things.
Courier companies get good money for fast delivery of goods. Often time is very important for business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repair.
In some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem in other routes and small companies.
If they sent goods by chartered aircraft, in some routes could spend several days in the execution of unloading and customs.
The only way to do that faster was to send things as checked baggage. According to airline regulations, you can't send a package without a passenger, and that's where you're taking the chance.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a very thick wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: in rough estimates, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy class fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, it's not worth the trouble to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties were resumed between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The major religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and vibrant commercial center, situated on a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The city's wide boulevards, glass-facade buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century bazaars, and old mosques and churches, but the atmosphere is more Mediterranean than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On some tombs in the church yard there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It is worth spending half an hour walking through the intriguing village.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron praised its great merits.
Bus line 403 from Scotturb runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (sanctuary), which is the site of world-famous apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and also a place with almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here and there are still many more who had loved ones who were killed or forced to work to death there, whether Jews or not.
Please behave in the place with as much dignity, solemnity and respect as it fully deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the site with marks or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it and almost all speak Spanish.
But still, most of the posters are only in Catalan, because the law has declared it the first official language.
In any case, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
In the metro, the regular announcements are only made in Catalan, but the unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a multitude of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have gained a reputation as self-centered, unkind and proud people.
This is often just a vague stereotype, but the best way to keep things smooth with Parisians is to behave like a bien élevé (well-educated).
The abrupt manner of Parisians will quickly evaporate if one shows basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly of beech, spruce and fir, and it presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of vegetarian communities is remarkably high due to the variety of microclimates, diverse soils and different altitudes.
The region is also home to an extremely diverse range of animal and bird species.
There you can find rare fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats and wild boars, in addition to many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts up to the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do provide laundry for women who arrive unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own laundry, especially if it's light in color.
Similarly, men must wear knee-high pants.
You can also borrow this from the storage room at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, and therefore you may not feel comfortable if you wear these skirts. There is one size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like those of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato and any available additives, such as cheese, tuna etc.
Every noun, in addition to the word Sie meaning you, always begins with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing gets a little more complicated because you need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in its substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters that are especially noteworthy are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: tsar means heart, while carro means cart.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively easy and regular in most cases.
So reading this grammar introduction would help you learn a lot of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It is needless to say that if one speaks a Romance language, it will make learning Portuguese easier.
But people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that it's not worth learning separately.
In general, pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and remain as museums or educational institutions.
Because then light pollution wasn't as big a problem as it is today, they're usually located in cities or at universities, places that are more accessible than those built in modern times.
The most modern telescopes for exploration are huge installations in remote locations under favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor for himself and other aristocrats around the imperial court.
Because plants look best in the wild, don't give in to the temptation to remove a sample, not even a single one.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting samples will also result in your expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to explore. Once you get there, you can buy almost anything there.
But still, since you'll be in the high tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to contend with the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the patriarchs from the Bible, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take is going to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good topic to base a vacation on.
This would allow for example to visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or to go by cruise ship to interesting towns on the Danube or by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also specify routes of well-known hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity. It celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Non-believers living in Christian countries or elsewhere around the world have adopted many of the traditions of this holiday.
Traditionally, the Easter night is spent awake in an outdoor location to watch the sunrise.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
On the Sabbath night of the Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil and the congregations begin celebrating at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands came either swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance between the islands and the mainland, mammals could not make such a journey and so the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since their arrival, humans have introduced many mammals to the Galapagos, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, that is, the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark almost all the time.
You can also enjoy the stars, because these areas are sparsely populated and so light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Costumes are the standard workwear and co-workers address each other by last names or job titles.
Workplace harmony is paramount, as is emphasis on group effort over praise of individual achievements.
Workers usually have to get the approval of their bosses for all decisions made and they have to follow the instructions without question.
