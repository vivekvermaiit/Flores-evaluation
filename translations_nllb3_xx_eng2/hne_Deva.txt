This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already widely held, but details the fossils generally cannot convey such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the carapace of this animal was topped with a yellow or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of wings in birds.
Since dinosaurs did not have a well-developed soft wing due to their feathers, called rachis, but had other features of wings - barbs and barbels - researchers speculated that the rachis presumably represented a later evolutionary evolution of the other features.
The wing structure suggests they were used not in flight but for temperature regulation or display.The researchers suggest that, even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings and not a female.

Much of the work done was theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be due to tidal forces between the galaxy's dark mantle and the Milky Way's dark mantle.
Just as the moon casts a shadow on the Earth, producing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in a similar way to how regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and is composed of many smaller particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters line up in a booth, lay out a pre-printed sheet of paper and paint a candidate of their choice on it.
After the voter's identity is verified by officials, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the start of voting and no envelope has been added except for the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evenings, following specific procedures, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy surveillance.

He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeboye has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court on a charge of murdering his stepson.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but no eyewitness evidence can be penalised as her image has been widely published.
In Britain this is common practice but Scottish justice operates differently and courts have seen the publication of the photographs as potentially an archive of the former.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee notes "Journalists are walking a dangerous line in publishing photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists who and what will not be commented on, at least until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the first borders since the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem which is purportedly sacred to both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel seeks a continued military presence in the Valley despite having agreed to sign a peace agreement once it does.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial had to be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, in partnership with the NPW and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (SWAA) Inc.
According to Mick O'Fallin, acting director of the Parks Conservancy and Legacy with the NPW, the four shooters who were slated for the first shooting operation received extensive security and training instructions.
Yesterday a new last Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members was sworn in.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a supervisory commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some as recently as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six burns and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, Matty announced that Apple had notified him of 34 additional hyperthermic events, which the company called "non-ganglyoric".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck at 07:19 am local time (09:19 GMT on Friday) in Mariana.
The Office of Northern Marianas Emergency Management said no damage occurred in the country.
Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no tsunami signals.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza pulled his M16 rifle on the tourists.
Many of the hostages have escaped and at least six have been confirmed so far.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later photographers took the place of a doll because she had to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins had started to investigate premature labor during her spare time while she was working at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs of the child.
Sinnois said government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died of cholera two moons ago. She was a very unique woman, very strong".
Dustin "Goldie" Runell commented, "Luna was as strange as I was ... maybe even more so ... love her and remember her ... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Caring Prime Minister Julie Gillard claimed during her 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Of the extremists surveyed, 29 per cent believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe Australia should not become a republic at all.
She won Olympic gold medals in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and was due to swim in the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but her fitness has been in doubt due to her complaints.
He has been unable to take the medications needed to relieve his pain because he has been banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could possibly be the source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that could create protein and support life.
Scientists hope to understand what makes up planets, especially how Earth is formed, since comets collided with Earth long before that.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "political flattery and folly".
He is projected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that would allow FAA claimed aircraft to fly small routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and cut carbon emissions every year.
This use of satellite-based technology contrasts with older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and give more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is carried out and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there is no car parking and park-and-ride facilities on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Archipelago.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and UBC University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process took much longer due to cross-breeding between a local Darwin finch, Geospiza forrestis, and a migrant cactus, Finch, Geospiza conyrostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes; it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It could be drawn into thin wires, which could be twisted and pleated. It could be hammered or spun into sheets.
It could be made very thin, and stuck into other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "light manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can make an indicator using the juice of red clover.
The juice of the gourd changes color depending on whether it is chemical of acidic or alkaline (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons trapped (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Twist the two dry powders together and then, with clean hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The tissue will react with the moist outer layers on the hands, which will feel moisturized and become a type of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia and China also had toilets.In Roman civilization, the toilet was sometimes part of a public bath house where men and women would stay together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is a thousand miles away, you use satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it almost instantly.
The satellites were launched into space by a rocket.Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and sights we see.
It takes a giant rocket 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways.To us the greatest thing about the wheel is it gives us much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Below that are more medium-sized beetles that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many smaller beetles (including the loose pet beetles) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special job each cat holds that prevents it from competing with others.
Seren are the most social of animals, living in larger groups called guides.
The prairie consists of one to three related adult males, as well as thirty females and cubs.
Polygamists and baitiques tend to be loosely lance-shaped to each other within a female extended family.
The lion taming behaves similarly to the colya or pack dogs, with the animals bearing strikingly similar traits to lions (but other larger cats), and are also very lethal to their prey.
A well-muscled and well-rounded athlete, tigers can climb (though not quite) as high as humans, leap as long distances and pull as much as five times the strength of a stronger human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panarhinera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars; these are the only four mammals that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not the same as the lion's full-voiced roar, but, like the cockroach, the words are shouted.
Ocelots (a medium-sized wild cat) prefer small animals to food. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all animals that the Ocelot preys on are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the occults followed and sniffed animals to eat (hunt) by smell, wherever they were on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with chariot vision, and can also move very stealthily. Ocelots mine their prey by mixing with their prey, then raise their prey.
When a small group (a small population) of surviving genera diverges from the main population (such as if they move to a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily migrate back) they will often find themselves in a different environment from what they were before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new populations will require different features or adaptations to be stronger competitors than the ones they previously required.
The native population has not changed at all, even requiring the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species.Species is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis; they also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and build our parks from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the supreme hunter of its time, so it frightened little but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw was lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth with an additional set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that it had no part of the skull for anything to cross its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included lemurs, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It did this in anything that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would not have been able to compete for it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had artifacts or unusual feasting objects called wild boar, monkeys, snails, and a type of rodent.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women sat in chairs eating their meals, the rich men preferred to have banquets together where they would lounge on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine may not have included the foods that would have been brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no turmeric, no tomato, no potato, no cocoa, and why the ancient Romans never tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods which was considered the house of the god.
Men would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary for the deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home was not as important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent in open banking.
Women cooked in the yard; stores were open counters seen from the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was reduced; in the Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, fire found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribe were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were &quot;Original Declaration of Independence 4 July 1776&quot;;. The text appears, in reverse, at the bottom of the document.
While no one writes it down, it is known that in its lifetime, the large parchment was rolled up for storage of documents (it was 241⁄2 inches by 2 93⁄4 inches).
So, it is likely that the notation was added as a label.
The D-Day landings and following battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Witchy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and Germany was turning over.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who co-operate and work together to form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, from Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civis, meaning city or city-state, and also defined the shape of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the passing of knowledge across many generations, a cultural footprint and equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government - with the Congress being the only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it was dependent on state authorities, who were often unwilling to enforce all of its acts.
It had no right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
Amending the articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could pass them, and the states so heavily discouraged the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, eye hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the clustering/clustering of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to as an &quotisland&quot in geographical terms.
The introduction of Taiwan was in the 15th century, where European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
There are three main structures at Machu Picchu, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings were reconstructed on the sides of the complex to give tourists a sense of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size close to the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is in fact, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Hence the aspect ratio of this format (when dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer-ratio) is called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or nearly approximate this aspect ratio.
The much-hyped and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline for generating dynamic range by keeping the measure of the arrangement in an image.
It suggests that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see Examples).
European history under examination came to a head in this period, amid the rise of the Catholic Church, which became prosperous and powerful.
Christianity had bound the European states together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
Subordinate power moved from the king to the common people.
One of the dominant Christian doctrines is that money should be used to alleviate poverty and suffering and that the church's monetary wealth is meant exclusively for good causes.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this centralization of power and money forced many to question whether this doctrine had been fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The tactic proved effective, cutting significant military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by numerous international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire stretch of the sea, which also posed a danger to neutral shipping.
Since there was limited response to such tactics, Germany expected a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations expressed a desire to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
There was also a turbulent era of provinces divided among each dynasty.The period most famously known at the time was the Three Kingdoms era which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period fierce wars took place between several nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people being killed for the chance to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi'an.
There were many social and political influences such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belonged to the people and not to any single ruler.
Besides this, after the revolution the professions were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to be promoted.
For this same army, the ranks of the army were now based on their caliber rather than being based on class.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions as well.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life; he frequently went to a cave known as the "Diamond" on the mountain of "Nur" (the light) for his meditation.
The caves themselves, which had survived the age, give a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a prominent peak among the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely different from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not so simple to find, even if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it is a complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen, except for the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains in the surrounding area. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, contains numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), numerous smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper arrow mark looks like a V and the "lower arrow mark" looks like a staple or a square with the downward disappearing part in it.
Up means you should start from your tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow typically produces a single soft sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more vocal.
Feel free to pencil in your own markings, but remember that printed bend marks are for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, his two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, he returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting against the king and queen.
The crowd forced each king and queen to leave the windows of their chariots open.
At one point a member of the crowd waved the head of one of the royal guards killed at Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
His American colonial regime was forced to pay taxes so that through his Wall Street banking houses he could pay a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government.
Undoubtedly, the super-profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the core benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the Order.
The age at which the events occurred, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD), is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending in about 1500, by convention.
The main meaning of technological determinism or technological imperative is that human destiny is learned from the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their expression in technology.Technical determinism is a term that encompasses a large range of ideas in practice.
Most explanations of technological transition share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path away from its cultural or political impact, and that in turn technology has an "impact" on underlying societies, rather than being socially conditioned.
One could say for example that the motor car necessarily carried the growth of roads.
However, a nationwide road network would not only help cars economically to some extent, so new methods of production are developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
Accidents on roads are proliferating, largely by car owners, leading to the invention of new technologies in health care for ragged jeans.
Sanestrianism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from such writers as Goethe, Fitch, and Schlegel.
In terms of nihilism, geography shaped the individual, and over time those customs and cultures related to geography emerged, and these, being consonant with the location of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, in the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world.
Its fame for being comfortable lasted until about 1100 AD and began to wane in 400 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts such as silk and spices that were more expensive than they had been in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of the Fashion Capital was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, the styles may be 25 to 30 years behind those in the West.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style; one of the largest events of the time resulted in the Crusades, in which people began using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological system that uses saved seeds for ecoregionation in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The traits that uniquely determine a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashions, mannerisms, and logic.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is drawing some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while they were growing up, through neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "wild" or "savage". Some wild children have been confined by people (usually their adoptive parents); in some cases this abandonment of children has resulted from parents' disregard for the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or separated.
Others are alleged to have raised animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When brought by completely non-human animals, wild child behavior (within physical limits) almost completely exhibited the special care-animal behaviors, such as fear or indifference of humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scalping is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be both virtual and real, in other words, a learning scaffold is a form of but also similar to the tiny paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and are meant to question, point out, and explain processes that might be challenging for the student to handle alone.
This can be used to demonstrate and practice problem solving in front of the entire class in mathematics.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safety net for these children.
The parenting care is expected to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home that they did before.
The parenting care is expected to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home that they did before.
The Internet connects elements of both interpersonal communication and goods.
Other dimensions are taken by the organ in terms of the use and experiential approach to the characteristics of the Internet.
&quot;Learning&quot; and &quot;socialization&quot; are suggested as important motivations, for example, for Internet usage (James et al. 1995).
"Individual engagement" and "continuous connection" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eghemi and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses on websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds to a few seconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether or not someone is lying by correctly interpreting the subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his paper The President's Speech that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
They also suggested that such abilities in explaining human behavior might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes the variation thus expressed from the pool.
Separation and recombination alter the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Outside of savannah, it is difficult for plants to meet their own amino-acid needs from the resources available to digestive primates like humans.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: developmental depression, malnutrition and, eventually, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources are the proteins available in the leaves and fruits, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (insects, worms, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do on savannas today.
Sleep interruption is the process of objectively waking up during one's normal sleep period and falling asleep after a certain amount of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring oneself to consciousness without waking oneself up at all.
If your child finds himself resetting the clock in his sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, allowing his or her to get out of bed to turn off the clock.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, which requires the person to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a single person has is inversely related to the amount of stress on his or her body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the vitality. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but was expanded upon by the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It includes the path of Kundalini yoga, meditation and all-pervading love.
Staring at a single point can effectively cause the same problem if one stops seeing everything else in one's own peripheral vision, or doesn't see enough motion.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the philosophy of various deities energy pulses are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, as was cooperation between the USSR and the USA.With the end of the war, the countries fell out due to the clash of systems, procedures, and cultures.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were no longer enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought, in real time, by pseudo-armies, on the battlefields of Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places, from Africa to Asia.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already broken down, and the Romanians were the only hope of withdrawing and reorganizing with a bridgehead.
However, this made the plans almost overnight obsolete, when more than 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods to transport large amounts of people and goods across the oceans is by far the most efficient method.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their own country maintains the ability to move its own people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with their enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of WWII, in which the US was attempting to transport men and material across the Atlantic Ocean in aid of Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using predominantly U-boats, was attempting to stem this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep their milk, hair, meat and skin within easy access.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed mountainous or other grazing areas, often resembling the more widely known sheepdogs, often of children or adolescents. These methods of herding are still in use today.
Wagonways were created in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagonway consisted only of parallel timber planks, it allowed their horses to gain more speed and pull more loads than the slightly more rough roads of the day.
Crosstays were introduced much earlier to keep the tracks in place.Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became common, but the iron caused more friction on the wagons' wooden wheels.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first full-iron rail was introduced.
The first known transport was by steam, with humans having begun to walk upright around two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (i.e. upright man).
They did not walk straight like their predecessor, Australopithecus adatanus.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 Ma, although Sahelthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to some extent to alleviate future suffering.
This is in many ways similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems, and we must inactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to mankind's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have gotten worse due to overpopulation and mankind's extraordinary lifestyles.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlop's printing shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 statues were made of the night, in what are now known as the "Dunlop Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his young troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
25 Dunlop Broadsides still exist which are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived, and they still survive today.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they are winged and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look very much like dinosaurs today.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk like a T-Rex on their two hind legs.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - using computer jargon.
Intrinsic toxicity may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that a prompt diagnosis may not be possible.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is already encountered with the Dhenkanas, which are adapted to make humans parasitic.
Both assassin-bugs and bed-bugs are nematodes that have adapted to live in their pet's burrow or house.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which leaves it as the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to get MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their children to adopt a child.
These couples may choose to plan adoptions for their children.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works by the scientific method, which in fact guides most scientific research.
Although not the only one, experiment, and an experiment is a test used to test one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed patterns in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will keep the freely-running cycling period going even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
He performed two experiments involving labeling proteins of phages with radioactive sulfur or DNA in phages with radioactive phosphorus.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the pieces of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells or not.
Mutations in germ-line cells alone can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the Organotungus in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to their high workplaces and pass by other people whose work destination is the place they have just left.
Each of these dynamic transport shuttles is connected in some way, and supports transport systems based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has moved the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone in society participates in and uses transportation systems; almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries one rarely hears the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or was something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within reasonably consistent limits; thus, the traffic flow has some reasonable stability and can therefore be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be transported by air.Their ability to fly helped them escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot bend their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought this was true but many believed the opposite, that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and thus other stars).
Hey everyone, it seems reasonable, why doesn't the Earth seem to be spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It holds 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and the technique of their construction never excelled.
In the New Kingdom Ancient Egyptians were astounded by the monuments of their predecessors which were a thousand years older than any time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent country and the most sparsely populated country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Not all citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are all detectable naturally in nature and relatively simple with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things were made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they could be transformed and not converted into new matter.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. The periodic table of these elements contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have mer alloys which contain trace amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter; all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good companion for many when they came out.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing appeared, the pencil fell into disrepute and decline in use.
People now type messages on computer screens, never having to come close to the sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is required to hold a nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
Such as someone rolling a heavy cart down a hill; splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they are separated very little and nowhere.
The Moon's surface is made up of dust rocks, the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The near side is about 70 km thick and the far side another 100 km thick.
It thins under mares and thickens under highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theory focuses on finding out what attracts people and what they do by appeal.
This theory suggests that some people have certain needs and desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories looked at what it is about people that they want to be, what motivates them to do certain things, and what does not motivate them to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hartzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former associates.One end of the spectrum tends to be people (or tourists) trying to stay in control.
This type of manager has unpopular decisions, difficulty making disciplinary actions, performance appraisals, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a stranger turns out to be someone who feels they must change everything the team does and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior is often a result of rifts between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They have five letters more autonomy than traditional team members because they can meet according to different time zones which may not be understood by their management.
The presence of a good idealized team (Lorson and LaFaveau 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The ideal team is the management team to which each member reports.
Organizational learning is one of the goal innovations of putting concepts into practice.
Creativity and ingenuity can be communicated when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, an organization's response works together to overcome a barrier that may be a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization is innovative, leadership must build a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the Katynum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating cognition; therefore, it narrows the research field and makes it more precise.
The links between brain pathology and behavior assist scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to observe and examine brain structures and processes we had never seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our brains.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent optimization.
Research in AI includes building machines to automate tasks that involve the creation of intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate topics, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher will choose to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips. Students can sit together in their classrooms to view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, and admire fine art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on any trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing.While students often begin their blogging experience with muddy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually alters this.
Since the student is often the most important audience, blog authors tend to start out trying to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
Also blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest drives students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and encourages students to learn beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can "empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet content, students are able to define their own position in terms of others' writing as well as outline their own point of view on particular issues" (Orewek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is home to a series of art galleries and museums that display Canada's past and present.
To the far south are Niagara Falls and to the north is home to Muscoota and its further unspoilt natural beauty.
All of these things and more accurately highlight Ontario as being Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas to the far north are considerably sparsely populated and contain some virtually uninhabited woodland.
For a population comparison that surprises some: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and in Comoros and Mayotte it was largely conquered.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female passenger state that she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (not just a bracelet which looks very expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in how they perceive harassment and that it is not uncommon for men to chase, hold hands, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (whether or not you have cultural differences doesn't justify it).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meranids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badja and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling the full spectrum of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookah, and gigos, along the Old Medina, but these are all open to tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
Goma was devastated by the Angara of the Nyiragongo volcano in 2002, which cordoned off the city streets, especially the city's shops.
While Goma is safe, any travel outside Goma must explore to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
The town is the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo volcano, with the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs. You could have used the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
With its relative inaccessibility, &quot;Timbuktu&quot; continued to be used as a metaphor for a foreign, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu remains a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the key stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
This city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab character than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, the border with Zimbabwe to the north, and the Alligator River on the southern border.
The park spans 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered to be the crown jewel of South Africa's national parks (Sanparks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance and entrance fees to the park.
It can also be beneficial for someone to buy a wild card, which grants entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or any one of all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is where many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a magnificent bar chart illustrated by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon Waterfront opposite.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely populated by reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where British colonists first settled and so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this would be a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian interior.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian Territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just mangrove swamps, however - it includes some of the last remaining stands of the powerful forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is water/swamp areas.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 cheetah deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially the buses heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of traveling to nearby places such as Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (NU 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The twin towers rise to a height of 83 m, is 378 m tall and has two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
Puliá is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be eliminated.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicur and the Payahuas, who made their living by gathering game and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", came into being as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' encounter with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Field in Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
For news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which has been set at a value equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located at Stanley, from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and credit cards and United States dollars are also frequently accepted within Stanley.
Credit cards are rarely accepted in the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be carried; ask the owners in advance to find out what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, which is why the islanders must exchange money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is hot there when winter is in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and moisture make it feel colder than it is on a thermometer.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, bears and wolves should be kept at a distance of at least 100 yards/meter and all other wild animals 25 yards/meter!
No matter how tame they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so let them stay in their place.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
During the War of Independence organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasi Lilongwe III.
The most popular are in the three areas.There are several beaches due to the Auckland organ swinging over the two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor District) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all parts of those protected towers are sandy beaches, and the memorial is shaded by Pohatucawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is Wetamatata Harbour in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Helier in central Auckland.
It sometimes becomes a crowded family beach, with shops lined up on the shores.
The main local beer is the 'number one', not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Other local beers are called &quot;manta&quot;.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are nervous.
The idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. There is a small black 'espresso', cappuccino comes with cream (without the foam ones), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards; fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many visits to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries to the reef from any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, consult the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found on beaches and along river mouths from October through April north of 1770, although they can sometimes be found beyond these periods.
Sharks do exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea; their primary habitat is in the North River estuary off Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that there will be arrangements to sleep on the beach after they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through the travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may defer your reservation for a while if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
However, any modifications or requests should first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of concert-goers choose to camp out on-site, and most hosts consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the action, you have to move quickly to get to a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music has ended on the main stages, there may still be parts of the celebration that go on late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic on a winter day, check the cabin location, as there is a fairly awful noise from the passing snow, which is very sensitive to the wind.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually make several attempts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to get out.
To keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them on campus, they usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment on offer.
In some places alcoholic drinks are served, however, drinking interferes with judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying calm.
Those who ever go to drive in high latitudes or mountains should, of course, consider the possibility of snow or freezing temperatures.
Snow and ice roads have less friction and you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to keep you trapped.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or by condensation or snow on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and attracts many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips underground to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, get close to cars and standard equipment allows a good view.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and you'd better look at them through a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a long hike, either for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you have booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not extend until late March, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place, and July 2020.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with specific tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them out. Iron and ironing boards are available on loan at many hotels, even if one does not exist in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like to wear socks that have iron, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to give the clothes too much heat (which may cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are various methods of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are required.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home areas.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergies, spread poisons, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill humans, do not generally qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers bound for countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which passes through the isolated backwoods terrain frequently.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be aware of your surroundings: steep grades, narrow streets and sharp turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than those for the earlier and later sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good and in Bavaria, similar to its southern neighbor of the heart, Austria, is quite rich and varied.
Fruit pastry is common, with apples being cooked into the pastry throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastry, try something called berliner, paffancochen, or craffen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With over 17,000 islands to China, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a huge variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
Again, if used without further qualifier, the word originally meant food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of dishes commonly experienced in the home, the predominant flavors being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The Lord is the support for the rider's feet which hang from both ends of the pole.
They provide more stability for the rider but may have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his legs get caught in the stirrups, they risk being dragged if the horse turns up the running bar. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions are taken.
First, most riders wear a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow, shoe shell.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly the English saddle, have safety straps that allow a rider's skin to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by the falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, featuring the Yosemite of South America, with its large walls and crag of various types of granite.
The summit features enticing views from the peaks. Mountaineers from all parts of the world continually establish new routes within its walls of endless potential.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as &quotski boms", planning the whole vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The ideas of skiing are very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
This is related to but usually does not include alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on standing terrain and requires very rigid skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you'll be able to cover some more distance than walking - but very rarely will you get the speed of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on the prepared track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control at times.
However, the Schengen Zone acts somewhat like its own country in this respect.
As long as you stay in these areas, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what constitutes a manufactured item to be antique. Most tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as an antique.
There are geographical variations in the definition, with the age limit in places such as North America being lower than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antique goods, although they are typically smaller than mass-produced goods.
Barbary farming is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture of the trade shore is important to many people with other occupations.

A course will typically cover all the issues discussed herein in more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically last 2-5 days and will include role playing, first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with forest survival are common, but publications dealing with the war zone are rare.
Sailors planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they are carrying valid documentation for the return journey.

Preoperative transgender people should not expect to go through the scanner while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rift currents are currents returning from waves breaking off from the shore, often resembling a cliff or ledge.
Due to the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated in a few deep segments, and can form a fast current in deep water.
Most deaths result from exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to target something that doesn't catch on again or, depending on your mind skills and whether you've been noticed, you may want to wait for rescue.
The shock of coming back, when compared to cultural shock of the same age (a honeymoon phase shortens), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who had an easier time adjusting to a new culture sometimes found it took a particularly long time to adjust to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and borrowed some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first moved to a foreign country, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that a new country needs to accommodate travelers.
People may not assume that even returning travelers need patience and understanding.
The Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the area's most enduringly fun attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the dark before they start.
Usually you hear tourists and vendors here all the time. It is as easy to say Deto to the sound and the light as it is to say Deto to the book.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long tale.
Pyramids are shown with scenes and other pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with only one active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
The latter includes Livingston Island and Cheos, where a small still active volcanic flood caldera gives a very lively natural harbour.
Ellsworth is the region located in the south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghaston Sea.
Here the peninsula slopes steeply down to the plateau, then reemerges to form the 360 km chain of Ellsworth Mountains, two tears from the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest peak, the Vinson Massif, at 4,892 m Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without cell phone coverage, a decent satellite phone may be the only option for you.
A fixed satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a fixed mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make phone calls.
The service is often used in shipping, which includes pleasure craft, as well as operations that require remote data and voice on the side.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those making gap year plans is to travel and learn.
It is especially popular with school dropouts, allowing them to drop out of university a year early without compromising their learning.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course in the sciences may improve their chances of getting into higher education in their home country in the future.
Usually there is a tuition fee for enrollment in this program of study.
Finland is a great place for a boat ride. There are thousands of islands in the thousands of lakes on the land and also in the coastal archipelago.
Islands and lakes do not necessarily require a raft.
The coastal archipelago and largest of the lakes are in fact too large for a small boat, with smaller boats or even a canoe giving a rather different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This corresponds to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is much more unique (for example in the Netherlands this figure is forty one each).
The more typical Baltic cruises facilitated an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can disembark the ship at night and tour the historic city for two whole days.
If you go to the coast using a mere shipboard excursion, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some travel brochures show Berlin, Germany.As you can see on the above map of Berlin, there is no oceanfront location and a trip to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It is not a matter of shame: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of many people towards other things.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during flight may help to allay fears that are based on the unknown or are out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering goods by mail. Often, the cost to ship the goods together with commercial documents, merchandise, or spare parts for immediate repair is very high.

In general, there is no point looking for a discount for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a group of passengers that are comfortable, and willing to spend high dollars for their convenience and charge them accordingly.
The language spoken in Moldova's capital, Chisinau, is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but has not been recognized by any UN country.
Economic links between these two parts of Moldova have been renewed despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very well-developed transportation hub.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Do not make fun of the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not desecrate the site by marking or placing graffiti in structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.

Parisians are known to be arrogant, rude, and conceited.
Although this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is still to be on your best behavior, which (acting like someone who is "bien élevé" is brought up to be well) will be considerably easier.
The sudden outsiders of the parish will quickly evaporate if you display some basic civility.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
It has a wide diversity of plant communities due to the range of microcrust, different soils and different levels of elevation.
