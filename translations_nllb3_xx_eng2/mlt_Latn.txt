USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making progress with significant change within our organisation, rather than by removing certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had faces, a theory already widely held, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists state that the face of this animal was chestnut brown at the top and light or carotenoid coloured at the bottom.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers, barbs and barbules, researchers have concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or viewing. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult and not the thin, soft feathers of the young.
The researchers suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the fur of a phallus.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon has a pull on the earth, causing tides, so too does the St. Anne's Path exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory says that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of dyadema and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters lock themselves in a booth and put a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter saves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law codifies the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly numbered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process.In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with murdering her son.
She is in custody pending charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be influenced because her photograph has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be putting themselves in danger by publishing photos etc. of suspicious persons".
The Crown Office, which is generally in charge of prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered reported to include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel calls for a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave this presence for five years only.
The additional test shooters for pest control had to be closely monitored by the forest rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association (SSA) hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Parks and Heritage Conservation Director Agent with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Some 60 cases of iPods damaged by overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it had been informed of the 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company termed as "not serious".
The Ministry of Finance also stated that the Commission had not received any comments from Apple regarding the allegedly unlawful aid.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there were no reported damages in the nation.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino ex-police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that administering a hormone accelerates the maturation of the fetal lung.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two 'black boxes' of flight recorders.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two summers. Truly unique like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as unusual as I...maybe even more so than I...love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believes Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of those surveyed agree with this view, and want Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the vote, 29 per cent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games relays, but his complaints raised doubts about his health.
He was unable to take the medication needed for his pain as they are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number by 25 January.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software by early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water delivery to the Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the Earth, since comets have collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the call as "words and political stupidity".
He is speculated to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being put in and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transport have raised the possibility that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science provided a report on the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have lasted much longer, due to cross-breeding between an endemic Darwin's sponge, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus sponge, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes.It can be rolled into small moulds.
It can be drawn in a thin wire, which can then be rolled and painted.
It can be made very thin, and attached to another metal.It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to draw hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes colour depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (since Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two powders dry together and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze them into a balloon.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the houses of public baths where men and women met together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket.Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet long to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing it has done for us is it has given us easier and faster transportation.
He brought with him the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including cats that are free-ranging pets) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a nest, a special task that every cat has and that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called "prides".
The groups (prides) are made up of one to three related adult males, together with a maximum of thirty females and young.
Women are generally closely related to each other, being a large family of brothers and sisters.
Ion groups behave like groups of puppies or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very fatal to their prey.
A good all-round athlete, the tiger can trot (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times the strength of a healthy human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can bark loudly.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar, but more like a sentence of clumsily spoken words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, reptiles, and birds if possible, though most of the animals it hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find prey by scent, keeping the ground where they are.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move with camouflage, too. Oselots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings then leaping onto their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (such as if they move over a range of mountains or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back) they often find themselves in a different environment from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, still needing the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not even be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. A lot of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, and so was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as another set of teeth with a roof of its own, meaning that anyone who came in its path had no chance of escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet included shrimp, cod, other mussels, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex was unstoppable.
While the majority of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including wild boar, peacocks, beetles, and a type of rodent-like rat that sleeps a lot.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their meals sitting on the benches, the rich men enjoyed having a communal dinner where they sat on their lap while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not include the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that was considered the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in the temple and, behind it, an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the goddess.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were simply an open street-front counter.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland had a small population. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the movie "National Treasure", you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote them, it is known that early in its history, the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added merely as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed had liberated the North of France, but the South still remained unfree.
It was led by the French "Vichy", who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large and significant group of people living and working cooperatively, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also defines the size of society in some way.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations.Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge across generations, a persistent cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce all its acts but, often, they were uncooperative.
It had no power to override the laws of taxation and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended and the states so disregarded the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) and, therefore, this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the large number of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, in geographical terms, as an "archipelago".
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the early 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, and begins a transformation in aboriginal wheat production practices and employs Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces take control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declare Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Much of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the greatest ratio of a simple integer) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to this aspect ratio, or very similar to it.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that cut the image vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has held European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His great power affected everyone from the king to the common peasant.
One of the core Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being achieved.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, halting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering whole sections of the ocean, thus endangering even neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to prevent a future repeat of such a situation.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former job manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different periods of time; each stage of China and each family in power were distinctive dynasties.
There was also a period of instability between each dynasty with the provinces divided, the most notable of these periods being the Three Kingdoms era which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history where thousands of humans died fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace at Xian.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same goes for the military because instead of being based on rank, army classifications were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became known as Hira on the Mountain of Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, clearly shows the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
On top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if someone knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen except a clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that has survived to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small crypts, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'top' mark appears as a V and the 'bottom' mark as a steeple or square without a bottom.
Top means you start at the tip and push the bow, and bottom means you start at the ring (the place where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper beat of a stringed instrument generates a softer sound, while the lower beat is louder and more assertive.
You can make any mark you want with the pencil, but remember that the bowing marks are there for a musical reason and so, normally, they must be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a violent mob of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of revellers shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to keep their carriage windows open wide.
One of the crowd members said the royal guard was killed in Versailles in front of the Queen who was on display.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay the bulk of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time in which the events occurred was commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, and so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher occurrence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged car bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of western Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status worsened during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued above what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
First, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because communication channels are slow, styles in the West may lag by 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. one of the major developments of that time as a result of the crusades was that people started using buttons to unlock clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses raised seeds native to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically many farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by using a different and symbolic style, which includes ways, manners, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialisation is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not socialised by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or "savage".Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of the child's serious intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are alleged to have been bred from animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When fully bred by non-human animals, the feral animal exhibits behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the particular animals that have taken care of it, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the learning method called scaffolding is more effective.
Escaffolding is not a learning method but, rather, an aid providing support to individuals going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Escaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but even the little man of the paper clip in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalised in the software and aims to ask, prompt, and explain procedures that might have been too challenging for the learner to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it still happens.
We consider the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and satisfactions.
For example, learning and socialisation are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, the surface movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his document 'The President's Speech', indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are, however, able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination blend the variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food (eels, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but provides a high quantity of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees living in the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the process where you deliberately wake up during your normal sleep period and go to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet revealer that wakes you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to find it.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bedtime, thus forcing the person to get up to pass urine.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of the present life.
Everyone can become enlightened.The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were enriched by the mahayana love path and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga. Through the visualization of several gods one clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates an enlightened consciousness.
Germany was still common in World War II, and led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war the disagreement in the system, process and culture led the countries to fight.
Just two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and was to be fought in earnest, by alternative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already divided, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War.The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to overcome Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that grazed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often attended by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar sheep herders.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted merely of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly more shallow roads of the time.
Crossties were introduced quite early to hold rails in place, but gradually it was realised that rails were more efficient if they had a strip of iron at the top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the cartoon's wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.In 1767, the first all-iron lines were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) appeared.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright in a habitual way.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases.However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems, and we must disable it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been made worse by mankind's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten bill signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and pointed claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like T. rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with the Bat, which are insects very suitable as parasites of humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nest-dwellers, adapted to live in a house or in the place of their host.
Around the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the interests of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main aim of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method.This method actually guides much of scientific research.
However it is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations is also a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycling even without external indications.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments by marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are cells of the microbial line.
Only mutations in the cells of the germ line can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts interested people to visit nature areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-the-spot activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the country's small towns by car to go to work and pass other people whose place of work is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has moved the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaint about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented approximately mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back in place along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot retract their wings are the mazzarella and the mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the earth does not feel moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at some points six miles wide.
In all, the Amazon provides 20 percent of all the water that is discharged by the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained the largest in size and the best in technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors who, by then, were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of many civil servants, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be discovered in nature in indigenous form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have an alloy that includes small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them sit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the lapis was a good companion for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, the lapis was relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now type messages on computer screens, and they never have to go near a computer.
Who knows what the keyboard will become when something newer is invented.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy for a nucleus to combine with many protons and neutrons.
In a similar way to pushing a heavy carton up a hill, splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that mean they tend to split with little effort.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km wide at its nearest point and 100 km wide at its farthest point.
It is thin under the maria and thick under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories are centred on finding out what makes people happy or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and what factors in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of attitudes can arise when managers start managing their former colleagues.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to take disciplinary action, to conduct evaluations, to assign responsibilities, and to hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unknown individual who feels he must change everything the team has done and brand it as his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often creates divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams can meet in varying time zones and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, they can bring out creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous Sequencing approach as a method being used to help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical proof of the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong connotation of fantasy, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as built into various home computer software applications and video games.
Field trips are a big part of every class.Often, a teacher likes to take her pupils to places where there is no possibility of going by bus.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips.Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the website is replaced, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing.Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually leads to this situation changing.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog starts working to improve the writing so that it is not criticized.
Blogging also "forces students to learn more about the world around them". The need to satisfy the interest of the audience inspires students to be more engaging and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students are able to define their positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's multilingual capital city and contains a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north are the untapped natural beauties of Muscat and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what is considered Canadian by foreigners.
Large areas further north have a rather sparse population and some are areas in a natural state almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest one, and a continent for it when we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is surrounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should state that she is married, whatever her current marital status.
It is helpful to wear a ring too (just not one that looks expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, snatched from the arms, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to insist on your preference (whether there are cultural differences or not, it does not mean that you have to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meronids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of geegaws, but all are touristic.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to know the state of the fighting still persisting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for trekking to the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the bodaboda (motor taxi) to get around Goma. The (local) normal price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short tour.
Along with its relative lack of accessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a bustling city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special series Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts strongly with the other cities of the country, as it has more Arab than African elements.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in Northeast South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the East, Zimbabwe to the North, and the Southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is spread over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the epitome of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, daily fees are applied for conservation and park entry.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either selections of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island (Hong Kong Island) gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The sculpture of the building forming the Hong Kong stairway has been likened to a brightly lit bar due to its being seen by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves in the steppe lands, they include some of the last remaining positions of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district (river-side) bus station during the day, although most of them, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
As the inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts have small, comfortable and robust Japanese Coaster Buses services.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two arches 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical gap under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be ready.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region contained other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' encounter with native groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley next to the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although it is possible that UK and US currency will be accepted; speak to owners in advance to see what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to change the Falklands currency outside the islands, so change the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals still roam wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
As docile as they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the proper distance.These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they give up their space.
However, be aware that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the mid-19th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval conflict in 1889 where seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the main Tupua chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, because Auckland is situated between two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all are sandy beaches with a safe swimming area, and the majority have the shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located within the Port of Waitemata, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly sandy beaches which are sometimes closed and have a good range of shops along the beach.
The main local beer is Number One, not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines probably travel better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of coffee being called "flat white" is unfamiliar. "Short black" is "espresso", cappuccino is filled with lots of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is by Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the stake are made all year round, and injuries due to any of these stake causes are rare.
Still, you should take advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety messages.
The box jellyfish is found along the beaches and along the estuaries of rivers from October to April in the north of 1770.
Although sharks do exist, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
If you book in advance, you can rest assured that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents often make arrangements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages including breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport and even flight-hotel combinations.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any amendment or request for a change shall be passed on to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival goers decide to camp on site, and many consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close you have to arrive early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may be over, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, be sure to check the cabin location, as the sound of crossing the ice is horrible for those most affected.
The cruises in Saint Petersburg include time in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximise the time and money spent by guests.There are generally no windows and clocks and it can be difficult to find the exit points.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers, to keep the guests in a good mood, and to keep them on the spot.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with snow and ice, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During heavy snowstorms, enough snow may fall in a short time to make you fall.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or melting snow or by condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to flow largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the focal point of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling on land for the observation of African wild and wonderful animals, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move closer to cars and near standard equipment that allows good views.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes crawled and best seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "footing") consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and typical tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Walking on wet clothes can help them dry.Many hotels have a walkway and a board available for you to use, even if you do not have one in your room.
If a walk-in shower is not available, or if you do not want to wear socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Care should be taken not to allow the cloth to become too hot (which may cause it to dry out, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, if you leave the water for a minute it is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter rare animals that are unfamiliar to them in the regions where they live.
Pests can contaminate food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, give poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, do not generally qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers going to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, as it often passes through isolated stretches of backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns predominate.
The maximum speed limits are considerably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict compliance is even more important than otherwise.
However, curiously, mobile service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastas are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastas are common, and cooked apples are used in pastas all year round, and pickling and cooking begin in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nuts, jelly, and other tree nuts.
If you want small but rich pastas, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a spice-based dish, along with meat or vegetables.
The carrier may be 'dry' or 'wet' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term covering the great variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available in the archipelago, includes a range of simple spiced dishes, and the predominant flavourings favored by the Javanese are carrots, chilis, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The staffs are footrests for the riders that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety issues due to the potential for the rider's feet to get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he may be trapped if the horse runs away.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with high heels and a rather flat and narrow chest.
Subsequently, some issues, in particular the British issue, have safety bars that allow the leather strap of the bar to be detached from the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - The main destination for Chilean climbers, known as the Yosemite of South America, with several large walls of granite and rock.
The highest points include spectacular views from the peaks.Fans from all parts of the world are continually establishing new routes amid the endless potential of its walls.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports involving skating on snow-covered ground on skis or snowboards attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many amateurs, sometimes known as 'ski bums', planning entire holidays around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking with skiers: This activity is also called backcountry ski, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not generally involve, touring skiing or alpine-style mountaineering, the latter of which is done on steep ground and requires much harder skis and boots.
Consider the skiing route as a similar rowing route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were to walk, but it is only very rarely that you will have the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but contains many independent countries.Typically, to travel between several countries you have to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you remain in this area, you will generally be able to cross the borders without having to pass again through the passport control points.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and documentation.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured items are antiques.Some tax agencies define items that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture around trade is also important to many people who have other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and had reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern trades.Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although used extensively, especially among non-Romani, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also consider consulting the advice of other governments than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory report is a concise summary of the political situation in a single country.
The views presented are often too quick, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rain, and wildfires are types and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, windstorms, sea storms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include severe snowstorms, avalanches, blizzards, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Any person organising a visit to a country which could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for a 'Hostile environment course' will probably bring up an address of a local company.
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course is usually 2-5 days and involves role play, much first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and journals on survival in the wild are common, but there are not too many publications on war zones.
Travellers planning surgical sex reassignment abroad should ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies equally widely.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves cutting off from the shore, often in a stick or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and can form a fast current for deep water there.
Many deaths occur from fatigue after attempting to swim backwards, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, it is no more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be caught again or, depending on your skills and if you have been spotted, you may prefer to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock precedes culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travellers who find it easy to adjust to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your own customs of your home country's culture.
When you first arrived, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light display of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things on the children's side.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
The sound and light story is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the colonization of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the submerged caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost region of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula mountains here join the plain, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern or central part of Sentinel has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you must be outside in clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need to communicate remotely with voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option among those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, and allows them to take a year off before entering university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during an interim year abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education back in your home country.
Typically there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programmes.
Finland is a very good sailing destination.The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need to go to the yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest pools are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Many of the distinguished cruises in the Baltic include an extended visit to St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, returning at night and sleeping on the ship.
If you only leave on land using onboard excursions you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in the booklets.As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions that many people have for other things.
For some, a little understanding of how planes work and how they fly can help them overcome a fear based on the unknown or things beyond their control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly.Often, time is of the essence in the case of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If you have sent the goods by air, some routes may take days to clear for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and here's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economic zero for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
In general, it does not make sense to look for discounts for business class and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain important group of air travellers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and in comfort, and to charge for these things.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău.The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, thriving and busy commercial center, built around a huge beach and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red-tiled houses, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one finds interesting marble sculptures of doves on certain graves.
You will not regret spending half an hour strolling around the intriguing village.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron's laudatory description of its great beauty.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, in the North, he visited the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Chapel), the site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that, in essence, you are visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site that has almost incalculable meaning for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who managed to survive the long time they spent here, and many more who had their loved ones killed or worked to death there, Jews as well as non-Jews.
Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not vandalise the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.About half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most people understand it, and almost everyone can practically speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used extensively in public transport and other facilities.
Regular Metro alerts are made in Catalan only, but unplanned disturbances are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, cold, and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to camp in Paris is still to behave like a well-behaved, well-bred son, which makes camping considerably easier.
The unfriendly attitudes of the Parisians are quickly swept aside by basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes nature park is covered with many trees, mainly beech, spruce and spruce, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude.
The area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, cockerel, lynx, wildcat and wild boar can be found there, along with many more common species
While visiting monasteries, women have to wear loincloths that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide a shawl for women who are not prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the abbess or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear knee-length trousers.
This can also be borrowed from the entry stock but those clothes are not washed after each person wears them and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these boots.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in every dish.
A popular and simple dish, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and the seasonings that are available such as cheese, tuna oil, etc.
All nouns, next to the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
This certainly facilitates reading, although the writing is a bit complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on which vowel follows them.
By the way, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and, for the most part, regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people with little knowledge of Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, remaining as museums, or educational sites.
As light pollution at their best was not the kind of problem we have now, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The display of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
the concept came from China where the carnation was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy only around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even a 'single' sample.
If you visit a formal organised garden, the collection of 'samples' will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you are in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you will have to face both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to catch goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a vacation around.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine valley or cruises to interesting towns on the Danube or boat trips along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of popular walking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of Christendom's most important holidays, and it is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in an exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter service on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands were brought here by swimming, crawling or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey and so the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal within the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter you experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be fairly dark all the time.
As the areas have a low population, and light pollution therefore often causes no problems, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard work clothes, and colleagues call each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the focus being on the effort of the group rather than on encouraging individual achievements.
Workers often need to get their superiors' approval for any decision they take, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without reservation.
