This not only confirms the widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils don't normally provide, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the animal's feathers are chestnut in color at the top and pale or pearly in color at the bottom.
This discovery also provides a new insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lacked a developed plumage (called "feather shaft") but had other feather features (such as a downward slant and small fins), the researchers inferred that the feather shaft may have evolved later than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult dinosaur, not a juvenile.
The researchers concluded that although this was a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample showed adult feathers, not juvenile feathers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters go into a voting booth, fill in their candidate on a pre-printed piece of paper, and put it in an envelope.
After the staff verifies the identity of the voters, the voters put the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter list.
The French electoral law is quite strict in its rules for the conduct of elections.
Since 1988, the ballot box must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in the box at the start of voting and no additional envelopes are put in except by voters who have been duly verified and authorized.
Candidates can be sent to witness every part of the election process on their behalf. In the evenings, volunteers cast their votes under strict supervision, following the procedure specified.

He was initially treated at the James Paget Hospital in Daejeon.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with the murder of her son and tried at the High Court of Edinburgh.
She is being held pending prosecution and trial, but the evidence of any witnesses could be affected by the widespread circulation of her photographs.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but unlike the Scottish justice system, the courts have ruled that the publication of the photo may constitute bias.
"It seems to be a dangerous thing if journalists publish photos of suspects and so on", said Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the prosecution, told reporters that it would not comment further, at least not until the prosecution is brought.
According to the leaked documents, the document is about the border dispute, in which the Palestinians want to base their borders on the pre-1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan River issue.
Israel has agreed to a 10-year military presence in the Jordan Valley, after demanding a ceasefire, while the Palestinian Authority has agreed to a five-year military presence.
The shooters who participate in the supplemental pest control trial will be closely supervised by the rangers, the trial will also be monitored, and the results will be evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in collaboration with the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) is recruiting qualified volunteers to participate in the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, the acting director of parks and monuments for the National Parks and Picnic Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a nine-member provisional electoral commission (CEP).
This is Malta's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP resign as part of a move to push the country towards new elections.
The commission was created in response to the massive anti-government demonstrations that began in Malta in October.
The protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections (some of which have not been held since 2011) and sometimes turned violent.
About 60 iPods were reported to have failed due to overheating, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy and Industry (METI) said that authorities had noted 27 accidents related to the device.
METI announced last week that Apple had received 34 additional reports of overheating, which the company deemed "not serious".
The provincial ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "regrettable".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Marianas says no reports of loss have been received in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami at the time.
A former Philippine police officer has hijacked a bus carrying tourists from Hong Kong and taken them hostage in Manila.
Orlando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been rescued, and at least six people have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, and a Filipino photographer were released early.
Later, the photographers replaced an elderly woman who needed to go to the toilet.
Likins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career as a student.
He trained as a gynaecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Lickins began to use her free time to research premature births.
His research showed that taking a hormone accelerated the growth of fetal lungs.
Chinese state media reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer says: "Luna was the first extreme queen and my first manager. She died on the night of the two moons, just as she was so unique and strong".
"Dustin" "Goldust" Runnels comments: "Luna is as ancient a freak as I am...and perhaps more than I have ever been...I love her and I will miss her...I hope she's gone to a better place".
Of the 1,400 respondents interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
In the 2010 federal election, incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share the same view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme, 29% think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible and 31% think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaint has raised questions about his health.
He has been unable to take the medication he needs for the pain because it is banned at the Olympics.
On January 25, mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number to date.
In early February, several people tested the finding with different hardware and software, and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how planets form, especially the Earth, which was hit by a comet a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described the rumors as "political rhetoric and stupidity".
He is rumored to be running for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration says NextGen systems can shorten aircraft flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the obsolete ground-based radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no additional transportation available, no overground trains stop at Wembley, and no underground car parks or shuttle facilities.
The competition may be forced to close if there are no supporters of the team due to the lack of transportation.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that it was long assumed that evolution would take longer, but that the new species evolved in just two generations due to the interbreeding of the local Darwin's bird (Geospiza fortes) and the exotic cactus bird (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes, and can be cut into smaller shapes.
It can be pulled into a form of a young cell, then twisted and folded. It can also be pressed or rolled into a piece.
Gold can also be made into very thin sheets, which are then plated on other metals. Sometimes, even thin sheets can be used to decorate the hand-drawn illustrations in books, which are called "mud-gilded manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator of this using the juice of the citrus fruit.
The color of the canola juice varies depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The sodium acid value (pH) indicates the amount of sodium (H) ions in the pH of the test chemical.
A proton is a proton that has been removed from an electron (because a proton and an electron are the same thing) from a hydrogen ion.
Mix the two dry powders and then use clean, dry hands to crush them into a spherical shape.
The moisture in the hands reacts with the outer layer of the material, producing a strange hand-feel and a shell-like shape.
In the cities of Jalapa and Mohenjo-daro, almost all houses have a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage treatment system.
Remains of sewage treatment systems have been found in houses in the town of Minos on the Greek island of Crete and on the island of Santorini.
Toilets were used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of the public bathroom, and were used by both men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space will bounce back almost immediately after receiving the call.
Satellites are launched by rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and field of view.
A giant rocket would need to reach over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in remarkable ways. Its greatest contribution is that it has made transportation easier and faster.
It brought us trains, cars and many other different types of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized prey including rabbits, hares, and deer.
Finally, many small felines (including domesticated cats) feed on a variety of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the proper division of labor, with each cat assigned a specific task, which prevents them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the felines, living in groups called "Lion herds".
A lions' pack consists of one to three adult lions, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are often closely related to each other, forming a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lions are similar in behavior to wolves or dogs, and they behave remarkably similar to lions (but unlike other large felines), and are very deadly to prey.
Tigers are all-round athletes, able to climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull with a force five times stronger than that of humans.
Tigers and lions, leopards and jaguars are all members of the genus [[Cercus]]. Of the cat family, only four species are known to chew.
The tiger's roar is different from the lion's loud roar, but more like the roar of a lion's teeth.
They like to eat small animals. They will catch rabbits, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. Almost all of the animals that the cat hunts are much smaller than the cat.
Scientists believe that the caterpillar uses its sense of smell to locate prey on the ground to find prey.
They have excellent night vision and can move silently in the dark. The caterpillar hunts its prey by blending into its surroundings and then killing it.
When a small group of organisms (a group of organisms with a smaller number of individuals) separates from their parent group (e.g. crossing a mountain or a river, or migrating to a new island, and not easily returning after reaching their destination), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
In a new environment with different resources and competitors, these new groups need to develop different behaviors or adaptations to become stronger competitors than before.
The original populations have not changed at all, and they still need the same adaptability as before.
As time goes on, these new groups begin to adapt to the new environment, and their differences with the other groups become more and more pronounced.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years of this baptism, the two groups look so different that they are no longer considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, the formation of new species. Species formation is an inevitable result of evolution, and a very important part of it.
Plants release oxygen for human respiration and absorb carbon dioxide from human exhalation.
Plants obtain food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide greenhouse gases.
We use plants to build our homes and make our clothes. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The dragon was the top predator of the era, so it was not afraid of anything except other dragonflies.
Its long jaws are filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth and extra teeth on the jaws, meaning that nothing in its path can escape.
We are not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included sea turtles, large fish, other lobsters, and possibly even its own kind.
It also attacks all things in the water. Even a giant dinosaur like the dragon can't compete with it.
Although much of their food was similar to ours, the Romans had their own peculiar tastes and unusual feast foods, including wild boars, peacocks, bison, and a rodent called the sleeping rat.
Another is that the poor and women eat sitting on chairs, while the rich prefer to sit on their backs at banquets.
Ancient Roman food could not have included ingredients that were only brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, the ancient Romans did not eat corn, tomatoes, onions, or cocoa beans, nor did they eat turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each temple, which was considered the temple's home.
People offer sacrifices to the deity, and the priests try to satisfy the deity's needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which was only accessible to priests.
The triangular-conical tower, sometimes called the pyramidal tower, was built as part of the temple.
The tower is the special sanctuary of the shrine.
As the climate warms in the Middle East, housing becomes less important.
Most Hebrew family life was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the backyard; shops were open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
The wood was very expensive, as there were no large forests in Canaan.
Greenlanders are rare. According to the Norse epic saga, Erik the Red-beard, exiled from Iceland for murder, discovered the island on his voyage westward and named it Greenland.
Whatever his findings, the Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each of these countries was once part of Scandinavia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland have very different people, kings, customs and histories.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence is painted with a hidden treasure.
But it's not true. Although there is some text on the back of the document, it's not a hidden treasure.
The reverse of the Declaration of Independence reads "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is shown in reverse at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 inches by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was preserved in an earlier period.
So the addition symbol is probably just for the tags.
The Normandy landings and subsequent campaigns liberated northern France, but the southern part of the country remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragonriders.
The American and Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks, and then turned to Germany.
A civilization is a group of people living and working together in a single culture (a society).
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin civilis, which is related to the Latin civis and civitas, which define the scale of society to some extent.
The city-state is the precursor of the state. A civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge, cultural traces and to some extent the transmission of knowledge over many generations.
Minority cultures often die out without leaving any historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a fragile central government under the Articles of Confederation (with Congress as its only component).
The Congress lacked any power to levy taxes. Furthermore, since no national executive or judicial organs existed at the time, the Congress had to rely on the state governments, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its decrees.
The Congress has no power to override the laws of the States concerning taxes and duties.
The amendment requires the unanimous consent of all the states, which do not pay much attention to the central government and are often absent from the state legislature.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are tied for second in the world, and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, volleyball, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as an archipelago because of its large number of islands.
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to reform the native grain production methods and employed Chinese laborers to work on its corn and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat of the Qing government in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Yama-Guan, which ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan's rule over the island ended only in 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, the Inti Tiwatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed, allowing visitors to better understand their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues today.
For example, 35 mm is the most common still image format in the world, and it is the most commonly used size at the end of the era of mock-filmed photography.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, the image sensor format of later digital cameras has adopted its aspect ratio.
The name 35 mm format is a bit vague, it is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of the length of the width of the format (the ratio of the simplest integer divided by twelve) is therefore 3 to 2.
Many common formats (e.g. the system format of advanced camera systems) are identical or different from this aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed triad is a simple rule that maintains order in the image while creating a vivid feeling.
It states that the most efficient position for the subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image horizontally into three equal parts (see example).
It was during this period in European history that the Catholic Church came under intense censorship as it grew in wealth and power.
For thousands of years, Christianity has been the foundation of European relations, despite differences in language and customs.
It is a pervasive force that affects everyone, whether king or commoner.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is why the church funds exist.
The centering power of the Church of Rome over the centuries, such a concentration of power and money, has led many to question whether it is consistent with the Creed.
The British imposed a naval blockade on Germany as the war began.
This strategy proved effective in cutting off the necessary military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated international law as established by international agreements over the past two centuries.
The British had established a blockade of international waters to prevent any vessel from entering the entire area of the sea, and posed a threat to neutral shipping.
Since the response to this strategy was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, most citizens and most countries took a position of platonism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations hoped to avoid a future repeat of this situation.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States, where he worked for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with a four-cent deposit, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods; each stage of China or ruling family was a unique dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there were periods of instability with the division of provinces. Of these periods, the most famous was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and the Qing dynasties.
During this period, many nobles fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to gain the highest throne in the Great Hall of the Xian Dynasty.
Many social and political influences followed, such as the adoption of feudalism, the shift from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the state belonged to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the revolution, all professions were opened to all men, leaving the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military, where the hierarchy is no longer based on rank, but on ability.
The French Revolution also awakened many oppressed working class masses in other countries to belong to their revolution.
Muhammad was interested in things other than the worldly life. He used to meditate in a cave called Hira on the mountain Noor (meaning "light").
The cave has stood the test of time, giving a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is isolated from the rest of the world, resting on the top of a hill in the north of Mecca.
In fact, it's hard to find even if you know it exists. When you're in a cave, it's absolutely isolated.
From the cave, you can see and hear only a small part of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, and is one of many pyramids built to commemorate deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead (also known as the "Giza Graveyard") is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a lion-man statue.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up" sign looks like a V, and the "down" sign looks like a square with a bookmark or missing the bottom.
Upward means you should start pushing the bow from the top, and downward means you should start pulling the bow from the base (where you hold the bow).
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow produces a louder and more substantial sound.
Write your own symbols, but remember that the printed symbols of the bow and arrow are for musical reasons, so in general, they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoine, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4-year-old Louis-Ch√®re, and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to return to the palace in Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a group of market ladies.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages.
A troublemaker, suddenly in the presence of a spooked queen, waves the title of the royal guard beheaded at Versailles.
The cost of the war was ultimately borne by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government and pay most of their expenses and bond interest through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
And of course, the extra profits generated by the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos will be the basic benefit of US imperialism.
Before we understand the Templars, we must understand the chronology that led to their creation.
The time of the event is often considered to be the high medieval period of European history, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 BC).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended around 1500 BC.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas that are being practiced, ranging from technological impetus or technological imperative, to, in a strict sense, the view that human destiny is driven by a deeper logic associated with the discipline of science and its technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common views: that the trajectory of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has an intrinsic "impact" on society, rather than being constrained by society.
For example, one might say that cars will inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, if there are only a few cars, a nationwide road network is not economically viable, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The large car ownership also led to more road accidents, and thus to the invention of new medical technologies to treat the injured body.
Romanticism has a great deal of cultural determinism, from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schleicher.
In the context of Romanticism, the geographical environment shapes the individual, and customs and cultures associated with the geographical environment emerge over time. Those cultural customs are in harmony with the positioning of society, rather than arbitrary imposed laws.
Just as Paris is the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as a center of luxury goods from 400 AD until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly due to the return of the Crusaders with spoils such as silk and spices, which were more popular than the goods offered on the Byzantine market.
Since then, Constantinople has been the fashion capital of the world, and Paris has been its capital.
The Gothic style reached its peak of popularity in the 10th-11th centuries and again in the 14th century.
The initial design of the chaise longue was influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication between the East and the West, the Western style became popular 25 to 30 years later than the Eastern.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own clothing styles. The most significant development at this time was the use of lace to tie clothes, which was introduced by the Crusaders.
Sustainable agriculture claims to produce only enough food to feed the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system that uses seeds left behind in the ecosystem and combines rotational tillage or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in sustainable agriculture, and this is still common in many developing countries today.
Subculture brings together a group of like-minded individuals who feel ignored by the social norm, and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
The distinctiveness of a subculture may be derived from the age, race, class, geography and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from others may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexual orientation, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership in unique and symbolic ways, including dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common ways of explaining the importance of socialization is to point out the few unfortunate cases of children who are not socialized by adults because they are neglected, unfortunate or intentionally abused in their development.
These children are generally referred to as "wild children". Some of the wild children have been detained by people (usually their parents), while others have been abandoned by parents who refuse to accept their children's severe mental or physical disabilities.
The wild child may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or left home.
Some are said to have been raised by animals, while others are believed to have survived in the wild on their own.
When a feral child is raised by a non-human animal, the behavior it exhibits (within the physical limits) is almost exactly the same as that of the animal that cares for him, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
The purpose of object-oriented learning is to make learning easier and more fun, but the falcon theory goes a step further.
Falconry is not a method of learning, but a support, helping people who are experiencing new learning processes, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
The falcon can be virtual or real, in other words, a teacher can be a form of the falcon, and the Microsoft Office wordsmith can be a form of the falcon.
The virtual falcon is built into the software to question, motivate and explain the processes that students find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up without care, love and education, and yet these children are experiencing it.
We believe that foster care is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care should provide everything that a family lacks.
The Internet has elements of mass media and social media.
The obvious characteristics of the Internet are that it expands the range of ways in which we use and satisfy.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995) „ÄÇ
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "continuity" as new motivations when studying user responses to websites.
The use of video to interpret the passing of micro-expressions and facial movements has led to major discoveries.
In particular, it is said that by accurately reading the micro-expressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks in his essay The Speech of the President points out that even people who cannot understand the speech due to brain damage can still accurately judge the sincerity of the speaker.
He even suggests that domestic animals such as dogs may also have this ability to read human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of mutations: latent and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variants and selectively remove the obvious variants in the gene pool.
The separation and rearrangement of the two sets of genes changes back and forth in each generation.
In the sparse grasslands, primates (with a digestive system similar to that of humans) had difficulty obtaining the amino acids they needed from available plant resources.
And the consequences of failure are severe: poor development, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant source is protein from leafy or legume plants, but these plants are difficult for us primates to digest if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (such as chicken, turkey, and eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Given this, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do it today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep within a short period of time (ten to sixty minutes).
It's easy to do with a relatively quiet alarm clock that keeps you awake without waking you up completely.
If you reset your alarm clock during sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room and force yourself to wake up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, which are known to be diuretic), and urinating in an emergency.
The inner calm of a person is inversely related to the physical and mental tension of a person.
The more relaxed, the more positive the life force is. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can realize that the only thing that is stopping us from moving towards this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was popularized by the love of Buddhism and many techniques derived from Hindu yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to great love.
Kundalini yoga is practiced by awakening the Kundalini energy through poses, breathing exercises, incantations, and visualization.
The central Tibetan meditation is the Zen Buddhist practice of visualizing the various shrines, purifying energy channels, channeling the pulse, and creating awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, and facilitated cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the two countries were divided by institutional, procedural, and cultural conflicts.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War officially began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be fought on the real battlefields from proxy armies in Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army, in violation of the Treaty of Leningrad, the Treaty of Non-Aggression of the Soviet Union against Poland, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invaded eastern Poland, entering and establishing the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts.
Shipping was the most efficient means of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean for a while.
The traditional role of the Navy is to ensure that your country is capable of transporting its citizens and cargoes while interfering with your enemy's ability to transport his citizens and cargoes.
One of the most notable modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The United States attempted to cross the Atlantic to transport men and supplies to aid the British.
At the same time, the German Navy used U-boats to try to stop the transport.
If the Allies fail, Germany could conquer Britain, as it had done with the rest of Europe.
The goat appears to have been domesticated for the first time in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes domesticated them for their milk, hair, meat, and skin.
The goats were usually raised in herds on mountains or other pastures, tended by shepherds, usually children or adolescents, similar to the better-known herders we know today. These herding methods are still used today.
England built carriages as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriageways were made of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to travel faster and to pull heavier loads than the rougher roads of the time.
The use of a pillow stick to fix the orbit was introduced early on. However, it was later discovered that a small amount of iron was more effective than the metal on the surface of the orbit.
This is a common practice, but iron causes more wear on the truck's wooden wheels.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones. The first all-iron wheels were introduced in 1767.
The earliest known means of transportation was by foot, and humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the appearance of the upright man.
Their ancestors, the southern great apes, did not walk upright.
Specialized forms of bipedal animals have been found in the fossil remains of the southern Apes from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but the Chadshahs may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can get involved in the environmental movement, we can even become activists, and we can do some harm to the future.
This is the same as the antidote in many situations. But if we want to do more than just temporarily fix the problem, then we should find the root of the problem and stop it from arising at the root.
It is clear that the world has been completely changed by the advancement of technology and technology. The problem is aggravated by overpopulation and the excessive luxury of human lifestyle.
After the House passed the bill on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the John Wrap Printing House a few blocks away.
150 to 200 copies were made overnight, and it is now called the "Clapper One-Sided Edition".
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon on July 8 in the front yard of the Independence Memorial.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy was sent to London on August 10.
The 25 known surviving single-sheet printed editions of the document are the oldest extant versions of the document. The original manuscript is no longer extant.
Now, many paleontologists believe that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived to this day. We call them birds.
Because they had feathers and could fly, many people don't think they were dinosaurs.
But there are still a lot of similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have claws and claws on their feet, and they lay eggs, and their hind legs walk like dragons.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in binary form.
Binary numbers can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and are known in computer jargon as binary numbers or bits.
Intestinal intoxication may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are very common and cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The most obvious signs of internal intoxication may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label of a particular poison for the designated first aid instructions.
The term "worm" is used by entomologists to refer to this group of insects in the formal sense.
The term derives from the ancient familiarity of the bed bug, which is a parasitic insect adapted to humans.
Assassin worms and bed bugs are nesting animals, and tend to live in the nests or homes of their hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may feel that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose to plan for their children's adoption.
In the process of adoption, the adoptive parents terminate their parental rights so that the other couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method does lead to most scientific research.
Experimentation is not the only way to do it, an experiment is a test to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations can also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters (including psychology) are widely accepted.
As Greek learning declined, the Western world became disconnected from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
The rhythms observed in many physiological and behavioral systems are often largely determined by the presence or absence of an internal circuit and its operation through the body clock.
Cyclic rhythms are not only responses to external cyclic cues, but are also recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The circadian clock is self-sustaining, and it cycles freely for a period of time, even when no external stimulus is present.
Hersh and Jones' experiment was one of the important proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hirsch and Jones used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one to label the DNA in the bacterium with radioactive chlorine, and the other to label the proteins in the bacterium with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are cells of the reproductive spectrum, mutations can have a variety of effects.
Only mutations in the cells of the reproductive spectrum can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
The nature-based tourism is a great attraction for nature lovers, as it allows to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn about the Organgatuangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from the village to their workplace, and they pass people who are going to the same place they just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is connected to and supports the transport system to some extent by their own car.
Now science says that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of the stable states that has been the backbone of human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in social activities and uses the transport system, and almost everyone complains about the transport system.
You don't hear this level of complaint in developed countries about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why is the traffic system so much of a problem, why does it break down every day, are the traffic engineers so incompetent, or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic studies are not easy because we can't predict the behavior of drivers with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to be within a reasonably stable range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have a certain reasonably consistent bandwidth, and can be roughly expressed in mathematical terms.
In order to better represent traffic flow, the relationship between three main characteristics is established: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) rate.
These relationships help plan, design and operate the road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily, while also finding food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backwards along their body.
This allows them to move to smaller areas to avoid predators.
Now the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards are the lizard and the owl.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some think he is right, but many think the opposite, that the solar system (including the sun and even other planets) moves around the earth.
It makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its water is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles across.
Of all the water on Earth that flows from rivers to the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main course is 6,387 km long and drains thousands of small rivers.
The pyramids were built using stone and were not surpassed until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the scale and construction techniques of the Great Pyramid of Giza were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed at the monuments of the previous period, which were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world by both area and population.
The official language of Vatican City is Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday life for the majority of the people who work in the country, while Latin is more commonly used for religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since antiquity, as they can be mined in nature in prototypes and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things were made from a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four forms of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. But his theory also states that the different forms of these elements will transform into new matter, forming what we see now.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many more elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as nickel and cobalt are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals, such as silver and gold.
Some alloys also contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is so small that a sentence in this sentence would contain trillions and trillions of atoms.
So when the pencil came out, a lot of people saw it as a friend.
Unfortunately, with the advent of modern writing methods, the pencil's status and frequency of use has decreased.
People no longer need a pencil to type on their computer screens.
People wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works by combining nuclei with lots of protons and neutrons, which requires energy.
It's like pushing a heavy hand cart up a hill. It splits the nucleus again and releases some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to separate with little or no vibration.
The lunar surface is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The front of the earthquake was about 70 km thick, and the back was about 100 km thick.
The lunar mantle is thinner under the sea; the upper mantle is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, there may be more lunar ocean in the front, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on why people do things and how they get interested in them.
These theories suggest that people develop certain needs and/or desires as they grow into adults.
These theories explore what makes people want to do certain things and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
The two most widely known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior that can occur when managers begin to lead former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of them".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning work duties and accountability.
At the other end of the spectrum, the manager becomes a completely different person, who believes that everything in the team must be changed and that he or she is responsible for everything.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior sometimes leads to division between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are slight differences between the two.
Virtual team members usually function as a point of contact for their physical team members.
Because their teams meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by managers in different locations, they tend to have more autonomy than members of traditional teams.
The existence of real "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a distinct component of virtual teams.
An "Invisible Team" is a management team whose members report to it. An invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an institution spend time building an institution that learns? One of the goals of an institution that learns is to innovate.
Creativity and originality are promoted when all available resources are fully utilized by the functional departments within the organization.
And finally, the process of working together to overcome challenges within the organization can lead to the process of innovation to serve the needs of the customer.
In order to innovate an organization, leaders must create a culture of innovation, and promote knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Ann (2006) explains that the continuum method is a method used to help institutions improve performance.
The data from neurobiology provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognitive research. They thus narrow the scope of the study and make it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by scientific research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, damage and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies has allowed us to observe and study the structure and functioning of the brain in ways we had never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build a simulation model that helps us understand how the brain works.
Despite its strong science fiction connotations, AI is still a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligence.
The study of artificial intelligence involves automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to control, plan and schedule, respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These are now separate fields, focusing on solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been incorporated into some software applications for home computers and electronic games.
Field trips are an important part of all teaching. Teachers often want to take students to places that are not directly accessible by buses to conduct field trips.
Technology provides virtual field exploration solutions. Students can sit in classrooms and explore museum artifacts, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art.
Virtual field trips are also a good way to reflect on the trips and share experiences in future teaching.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design an annual website about their trip to the state capital, which is updated annually, but the old version is kept online as a keepsake.
Blogs also improve students' writing skills. Students often make deliberate grammatical and spelling mistakes when they start blogging, and the presence of readers can generally change this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, bloggers will start working on improving their writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, the weblog "Improving students' understanding of the environment around them". satisfies the need of readers to inspire students to become more intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blogs are a tool to inspire students to collaborate outside of school and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of local blogs "enhances students' analytical skills and critical thinking; by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their own position based on the syntax of other articles and outline their views on specific issues" (Olacek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating bilingual capital, featuring a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are undeveloped natural landscapes such as the Muscocca River.
All of this makes Ontario stand out and is considered a typical Canadian place.
Most of the northern part of the country is sparsely populated, and some are even uninhabited wilderness.
This is a demographic contrast that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Archipelago is located off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in the world and home to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France, and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land and made large-scale conquests in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope, a route from Europe to India.
The northern part of the country is surrounded by the Sahel, while the south and west are surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: I would advise any female traveler, regardless of their marital status, to say they are married.
It helps to bring a ring (just don't look too expensive)
Women should understand that certain cultural differences can or do lead to incidents that are considered harassment, such as being followed or grabbed by the arm are common.
Don't be afraid to say no to a man, and don't be afraid to express your opinion (cultural differences are no excuse!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Darou-Badia, and Spanish merchants established a trading post there and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping destinations in Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as Taj pots, pottery, utensils, water pipes and all kinds of small toys in the vicinity of the old Medina, but all of them are aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is located in the easternmost part of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo. The lava covered most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit to Goma should be done with the aim of studying the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also home to Mount Nyiragongo, the highest volcano in Africa, and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking service in Africa.
You can take a Bodo Moto taxi to tour Goma. The normal price for a short trip (local) is about 500 Congolese francs.
In addition to being relatively inaccessible, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for a distantly exotic atmosphere.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its historical reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the site was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the effects of the desert sandstorm.
The PBS special The African Wonders of the World by Henry Louis Gates listed it as one of the top stops.
The city is a sharp contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab feel than other African cities.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa. It is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Shark River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into fourteen different ecoregions, each with a different wildlife habitat.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship park of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily maintenance fee and an entrance fee.
It is also good if you buy a wild card, which allows you to enter certain South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is a synonym for Hong Kong and a focal point for many tourists.
The many skyscrapers that make up Hong Kong's skyline are a shimmering pattern of light, especially visible under the sea of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to see the best views of Hong Kong, leave Hong Kong Island and head to the other side of the island, Kyung Loong Beach.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the landfill on the north shore.
The site was occupied by the British and is a good starting point for anyone looking for evidence of the colonial history of the territory.
The Suddan is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to inland Bangladesh and India.
Sudban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest located within the Indian territory is known as Sudban National Park.
However, the forests here are not just mangrove swamps, they also include the last remnants of the huge mangrove forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The area of Sudban is 3,850 km2, of which about a third is water/swamp area.
Sudban has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. It is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 plum deer in the area.
There are buses departing from the regional bus station (the opposite bank of the river) all year round, but most of them are concentrated between 06:30 and 07:30 (especially for the eastbound and the Canc√∫n/Bumdon services).
Since the inter-regional buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets several days in advance.
Most of the area is served by a small Japanese Coaster Bus, which is comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (¬£150) and Punakha (¬£200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a sliding bridge that spans the Oiapoque River and connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with the city of S√£o Jorge de Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The twin towers are 83 m high, the main span is 378 m long, and the two arches have 3.50 m of carriageway.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 meters high. It was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian Customs Checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaran√≠ people, who live in what is now eastern Paraguay, are the largest indigenous group in the region. They live as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua. They live by hunting, gathering food and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Province of the Indians", was born as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounters with the local indigenous people.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.
Since its founding in the Amazon in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best equestrian teams and players in the world.
The biggest chess tournament of the year is held in December at the Lascanitas Racecourse.
Smaller tournaments and competitions are also held during the rest of the year.
For information on the competition and where to buy tickets for the polo tournament, see Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of one British pound (GBP).
The currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located opposite the Stanley FIC West store.
Pounds can be used anywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are generally accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are not generally accepted in the Islands, but British and American currency may be accepted; payment methods should be confirmed in advance with the store owner.
It is almost impossible to change the Falkland Islands currency outside the island, so it is necessary to change the currency before leaving.
Since the Montevideo region is south of the equator, it is summer there in the Northern Hemisphere during winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above 30 ¬∞C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be mistaken for cold: temperatures are rarely below zero, but with the addition of wind and humidity, it can feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy season" or "dry season": rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to seeing humans, these wild animals still retain their wild nature and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park's regulations, a distance of at least 100 yards must be maintained between a bear and a wolf, and at least 25 yards must be maintained between a bear and a wolf and other wild animals!
Despite how friendly it may seem, the wild bull, deer, bear, and almost all large animals can attack humans.
Dozens of tourists are injured each year because they do not keep a proper distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so please keep your distance from them.
Also, be aware that the smell may attract bears or other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly smelling food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
A peaceful meeting in the town led to the death of the paramount leader, Tupua Tamase Relofi III, during the struggle for independence of the Mau movement.
Since Auckland is crossed by two harbours, there are many beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
North Shore Beach (North Harbor District) is located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are suitable for swimming, and most are planted with New Zealand Christmas trees, providing shade.
Tamaki Road Beach is located in the Port of Waitangi, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
It is popular with families, and is sometimes crowded, with many shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is called "Manta". It is not a complicated beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can get a lot of French wine here, but New Zealand and Australian are probably better shipped.
The local tap water is safe to drink. However, if you are afraid, it is easy to find bottled water.
For Australians, "white" coffee is a foreign concept. Short black coffee is "Italian condensed coffee", bubble coffee is highly taboo (not milk bubble), while tea is milkless.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although the fruit juice is expensive, the quality is excellent.
Many people visit the reef year-round. Injuries to the reef due to any of these reasons are rare.
Nevertheless, it is still advisable to follow the advice of the authorities, to follow all signs and to pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April 1770, box jellyfish were found near beaches and estuaries. Outside of this period, they were occasionally found.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim on their own.
The saltwater crocodile is not primarily marine. Its main habitat is the estuary of the North Rockhampton River.
Booking in advance allows travelers to have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination, and to feel safe.
Travel agencies usually work with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation through travel agencies, such as camping.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even a combination flight and hotel package.
If you need time to think about the price or other documents for your destination (e.g. visa), they can also reserve your reservation for you.
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agency, not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, most festival goers choose to camp on the grounds, and they consider it an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the action, get there early and find a campsite close to the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stage may have ended, some parts of the festival may still be playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with children.
If you are travelling north of the Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of the cabins, because the cabins most affected by the ice will be very noisy.
The tour of St. Petersburg includes the time spent in the city. Postal passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions for details).
Casinos usually try to make their guests spend as much time and money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it is difficult to find an exit.
They often have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in the casino.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice and cold temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is less, and cannot be driven in the same way as on normal asphalt roads.
In a blizzard, a very short amount of snowfall is enough to keep you trapped.
Visibility may be limited by snow or snow blowing, or by glare or frost on car windows.
On the other hand, frost and snow are common in many countries, and traffic is almost uninterrupted all year round.
Hunting trips are perhaps the most attractive tourist activities in Africa, and one of the most anticipated by many travelers.
The term "hunting trip" generally refers to a trip by land to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the tropical grasslands.
Some animals (e.g. elephants and giraffes) prefer to be close to cars, and standard equipment allows you to see clearly.
Sometimes lions, eels, and crows are shy and easier to see with binoculars.
Hunting trips (also known as "jungle walks", "hunting expeditions", or "walking") are trips that last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other regions of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the last time being in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay is announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellations have excluded July 2020 (the original date of the Olympics).
The ticket price for most events is expected to range from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price of about 7,000 yen.
The clothes can be dried by hand. Many hotels have a washer and drying board available even if there are no rooms.
If you don't have a hammer, or you don't like to wear a hammered trousers, then if you have a fan, you can try it.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this will cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are many different ways to purify water, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if you have concerns, consider buying sealed bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter animals and pests that are not common in their home country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force, do not usually meet the criteria for being pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the purchase of duty-free goods in a particular place.
Travelers in countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, on the stretch of road between Marion Point and Fairmont, presents the most challenging driving environment, often traversing remote and remote terrain.
If you are not used to driving on the country roads, be careful: there are mainly steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves.
The legal speed limit is significantly lower than on the previous and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to speed is more important than anything else.
But strangely enough, the cell phone signal is much stronger than many other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania desert.
German pastries are delicious, while Bavarian pastries are similar to those of its southern neighbor Austria, with a great variety of styles.
Fruit cakes are common, and are made with apples all year round, while carpets and rugs are a regular summer guest.
Many German cooking dishes also include almonds, coconuts and other nuts. Popular cakes with a cup of strong coffee are often a great accompaniment.
If you want to try a little bit of delicious pastries, try the Berliner Pfannkuchen, also known as Pfannkuchen or Krapfens, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish that is made with spices and herbs, and is served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "salty" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common ingredient in curry; in southern India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, people commonly use coconut milk.
With over 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catchall term that covers a wide variety of local cuisines from all over the country.
However, without further modification, the term tends to be interpreted as referring to food originating from central and eastern Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine is ubiquitous on the islands, including a range of simple and flavoured dishes, the main spices of Javanese preference being peanuts, garlic, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle is a support for the rider's feet, suspended on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but also pose a safety risk as the rider's foot may get stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse but one foot is stuck on the saddle and the horse runs away, they may be dragged. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riding boots have a slippery, rather narrow sole and heel.
Secondly, some ponies (especially the English) have a safety harness that allows the rider to pull backwards when the horse falls, and the pony's skin falls off the saddle.
The highest point in Chile, the Cochamo Valley, known as the "Champion Valley of South America", is distinguished by its enormous granite walls and ramparts.
The view from the top of the mountain is breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world develop new roads along the valley's steep walls.
Downhill skiing (including skiing and snowboarding) is popular, where the skier slides down the snow-covered terrain by tying a ski or snowboard to his feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity, and there are many enthusiasts (sometimes referred to as "ski fanatics") who plan their entire vacation around skiing at specific locations.
The concept of skiing is so old, that depictions of skiers in cave paintings date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
Although related to alpine-style ski tourism or mountaineering, most do not involve the latter. The latter is performed on steep slopes, requiring harder skis and boots.
Think of skiing routes as being like hiking routes.
In good conditions, your skiing range can be longer than walking distance. However, in very rare cases, you can have cross-country skiing speed without carrying a heavy backpack on a neat track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. In general, travel to many countries means having to apply for visas and pass passport checks many times.
However, the Shingon region functions as a state in this regard.
Passports are usually checked at border crossings, as long as they are within the Shinkansen region.
Similarly, if you have a visa for Singapore, you would have to apply for a visa for each of the member states, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no single definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define antiques as items that are over a hundred years old.
This definition varies by geography, with North American and other countries having shorter annuity limits for antiques than Europe.
Crafts may be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than the mass-produced products of the same kind.
Reindeer herding is an important part of the Sami people's livelihood, and the culture of reindeer trade is important for many other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami people engage in large-scale reindeer herding, but live off fishing, hunting and similar activities, with reindeer mainly used as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people are engaged in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami people.
Although the term "gypsy" is widely used (especially for non-Roma), it is often considered offensive because of the negative stereotypes and misconceptions it conjures up about the Roma.
If a travel warning is issued for a country you are visiting, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
In addition to consulting their own national government, they may consult the governments of other countries, but their advice is often directed to their citizens.
To give an example, US citizens in the Middle East may be in a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
A travel warning is a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The advice presented here is rather crude and overly simplistic compared to more detailed information elsewhere.
Bad weather is a collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and can be of different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, hail, excessive rain and wildfires are all forms and effects of bad weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any adverse weather risks that may affect their local area, as they may affect any tourism plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone must first undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for "Environmental Courses Against the Enemy" will give you the address of the local company.
A course usually covers all the topics discussed here, analyses them in detail, and generally includes practical experience.
A course typically lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid training, and some weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but there are very few references to war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents with them for the return journey.
The governments of the various countries have different preferences on issuing passports without gender ((X) or renewing them to conform to the required name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to implement these documents varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, security checkpoints became even more troubling.
Transgender people should not expect to be able to maintain their privacy and dignity while undergoing a CT scan.
An offshore current is a wave that hits the beach and then backs away, usually at a reef or similar location.
The fast tides to deep water may be due to the concentration of the underwater topographic rebound in some deeper parts.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the tide, which is unlikely to succeed.
Once you're out of the current, it's as simple as swimming back.
When you're not found, try to target somewhere else, but that depends on your ability and whether you've been spotted, because you might want to wait for rescue.
The return to work shock is more immediate than the cultural shock (shorter honeymoon period). It lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted to new cultures have sometimes found it difficult to re-adapt to their native cultures.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits in your native culture.
When you first go abroad, people may be patient and understanding. Because they know that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
What people might not realize is that patience and understanding are also required for travelers returning home.
For the children, the Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the most fun activities in the area.
You can watch the pyramids in the dark and watch them in silence before the show.
Usually, you always hear the voices of tourists and merchants. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The lion-man figure is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
The pyramids are illuminated by different light sources.
Discovered in 1819, South Shetland is currently claimed by several countries, with the largest number of bases on the island, 16 in operation as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is the location of the town of Las Estr√≠as.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still active volcanic crater has been flooded to form a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is the southernmost point of the peninsula and is surrounded by the Bering Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau, which then gives rise to the 360 km-long Ellsworth Range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern or Centennial Range contains the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the summit of Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite telephony cannot replace mobile phones in general, because you have to be outdoors and unobstructed between you and the satellite to make a call.
This service is often used for navigation, including yachts, and expeditions with long-distance data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about how to connect to this service.
Travel and studying is a growing popular option for those planning a gap year.
It is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before going to college without affecting their education.
In many cases, studying abroad can actually increase your chances of returning to your home country to pursue higher education.
In general, these educational programs require tuition fees.
Finland is ideal for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" is also home to thousands of islands in lakes and coastal islands.
Yachts are not a necessity for tourism on islands and lakes.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, small boats and even a yacht can offer a different experience.
Boating is a very popular pastime for Finns, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Similarly, in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, Finland is unique in comparison to other countries (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is one in forty).
Most of the unique Baltic cruises have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historical city for two full days and then go back to sleep on the boat at night.
As of 2009, you do not need an additional visa if you are traveling by boat to the shore.
Some of the postcards feature Berlin, Germany on the booklet. As seen from the map above, Berlin has no sea access and the cost of visiting the city is not included in the price of the tour boat.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of any age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions that many of us have for other things.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens in flight may help overcome a fear based on the unknown or uncontrollable.
Courier companies are well compensated for the speed of delivery. Time is often very important for commercial documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, the big companies have their own planes, but on other routes and smaller companies, there are problems.
If they are transporting the cargo by air, it may take days for some routes to unload and clear customs.
The fastest way is to send it as a hold baggage. The airline rules don't allow luggage to be carried without passengers, and that's where you need to be.
The most obvious way to get into first class or business class is to pay a lot of money to enjoy this privilege (a better way is to have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: based on rough estimates, you can expect business class to cost four times more than economy class, and first class 11 times more!
In general, it is not useful to get a discount on business class or first class seats to fly direct from point A to point B.
As airlines are well aware, some core carriers are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of reaching a destination quickly and comfortably, and therefore charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi≈üinƒÉu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, plagued by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of the Dniester in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

The city's wide, leafy avenues, glass-enclosed architecture, modern shopping malls with traditional red-brick roofs, 18th-century markets, and old mosques and churches all have a Mediterranean European flavor to them, rather than the traditional Turkish one.
The nearby island of Toast is visible from the village of Haldasvik, which also has a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, some of the tombs are topped with interesting marble statues of the coffin.
This charming village is worth a half-hour's walk.

Regular broadcasts in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by the automated broadcasting system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for their egotism, their rudeness, and their hubris.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to show your best side, as if you were a "bien √©lev√©" ("well-educated") person. This will make the tour much easier.
If you show some basic courtesy, the rude appearance of a Parisian will soon disappear.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mainly mountain pine, juniper and spruce trees, and a mix of highland and Mediterranean vegetation.
Because it has a range of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes, it is clear that it has a particularly diverse plant community.

When visiting the monastery, the women must wear a full-length veil that covers the knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries will provide scarves for unprepared ladies, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, the monk or nun at the entrance will reward you with a smile.
At the same time, men must wear knee-length trousers.
These can also be borrowed from the inventory at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing these one-size-fits-all men's pants!
Mallorca's cuisine is similar to that of similar Mediterranean regions, with bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) predominating, and the use of olive oil is common.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner especially popular in summer: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available seasonings such as cheese, tuna fish etc.
All nouns used with "Sie" must begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to separate verbs from pinyin.
This can also be said to make it easier to read, although it is a bit more complicated to write, because it requires figuring out whether a verb or adjective is used in an embodied form.
Italian is relatively easy to pronounce, because most of the words are pronounced in the way they are written.
Note the two major letters, c and g, because their pronunciation is based on the following vowel changes:

Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book will help you learn more about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Of course, it's much easier for you to learn Portuguese if you know one of the Romance languages.
However, a person with only a modest knowledge of Spanish might conclude that there is no need to learn Portuguese, which is very similar.
The pre-modern observatory has been largely abandoned and preserved as a museum or educational site.
Because light pollution was less severe in their heyday, they were often located in cities or on school campuses, more accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami (Ëä±Ë¶ã, hanami?) is a Japanese art form that has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China. There, people choose to admire the plum.
In Japan, the first flower party was held by the emperor for himself and other members of the imperial family near the palace.
A plant is beautiful in its natural environment, so you have to resist the temptation to take just a little sample.
If you visit the carefully laid out gardens and collect "samples" you will surely be expelled, no discussion left.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, and it's very easy to travel, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But Singapore is located a few degrees north of the equator in the "high tropics", so you have to get used to (often) the heat and the sun (less often when the weather is clear).
And a few buses go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure you want to take the bus to Hebron, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Al-Ba.
Inland waterways may be a good topic for a vacation.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire and Rhine valleys, or take a boat tour of interesting towns on the Dordogne, or go sailing around the Erie Canal.
They also design popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.
Many of the traditions of the holiday have been adopted by non-Christians in Christian countries and around the world.
There is a tradition of waking up at a certain time on the night of Easter to see the sunrise.
Christian theology can explain the origin of this tradition, of course, but it's more likely a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
More traditional churches usually hold Easter vigils on Saturday nights during the Easter weekend, with the congregation often jumping into the festivities at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the island came here by swimming, flying or floating.
The remoteness of the mainland, which prevents mammals from travelling long distances, has made the giant land tortoise the principal grazing animal of the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun never rises above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to observe the aurorae, as the sky will be dark 24 hours a day.
