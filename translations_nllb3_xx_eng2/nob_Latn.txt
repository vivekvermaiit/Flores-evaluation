This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already popular, but shows details that fossils usually do not have the ability to show, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a pale or a carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other features for feathers  spikes and sleeves  the researchers assumed that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development like the other relevant features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathered clothing and not chickenskin.
The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a dinosaur, the feathered coat of the specimen was that of an adult and not a chicken's dun.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon affects gravity on Earth, and thus causes tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy with its forces.
The researchers concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in a similar way to ordinary matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of glory, made up of many small particles.

In France, voting rights have traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters enter alone into a booth, laying a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their candidate's choice in a envelope.
After the official confirms the identity of the voter, the voter drops the convolut in the ballot box and signs the call for votes.
French electoral law has a fairly strict codification of the law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no ballot boxes are present at the start of voting and that no ballot boxes are added except those that are carefully counted and those from approved voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all parts of the process, and during the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers following specific procedures and under strict control.

In her second race, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch in first place and 1:09.02 minutes behind Gøngyi Dani of Hungary in ninth place.
In the women's sitting group, four skiers failed to complete the race, and 45 of the total 117 athletes in the slalom failed to advance.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile and her portable computer".
The suspects are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with their faces covered, said police officer Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
Emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT, while the street where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh's court for killing his son.
She is being held in custody awaiting trial, but any eyewitnesses may have been affected since her image has been widely publicized.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, so courts consider the publication of images as potentially harmful to the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes journalists look like they're hanging in a thin thread if they publish pictures etc. of suspects.
Journalists have been informed by the Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, that no further comments will be made before the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, refers to the border irregularities, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East War.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley, was among the topics discussed.
Israel demands a steady military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state agrees to let this force remain for only five years.
The use of shooters in supplemental pest control was closely monitored by forest rangers, which led to the monitoring of the trial and evaluation of its effectiveness.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters for the first shoot operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new election council (CEP) of 9 members yesterday.
It's actually Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission recommended last month the former CEP dismissal (Haiti's election commission) as part of a package of measures to drive the country toward new elections.
The commission was a response from Martelly to widespread demonstrations against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations arose from the lack of elections, some of which had been held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and injuring four people with minor injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (METI) said that they had been clear of 27 accidents related to the facilities.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (19:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication that a tsunami was coming.
A Filipino man who had previously been a police officer has held tourists in Hong Kong as prisoners by hijacking their bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the old, as well as the Philippine photographers, were released early.
Photographers took the place of an old woman who needed to use the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a medical career.
He trained as a birth doctor and in 1959 began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would increase the rate of development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that state investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other breeders also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was as nice as me...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued in the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the public share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim both 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three stages during the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, doubts have been raised about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain, because they are forbidden from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known primes to date.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, it was reported Tuesday.
Comets may have been the cause of water on Earth, as well as ecological matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially with Earth in mind.
Cuomo, 53, began serving as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political skravling and stupidity".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will make it possible to fly shorter routes and annually save a lot of fuel and formine carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology in contrast to older ground-based technology that allows air traffic control to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is being put in, trains over the ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and short-time facilities are unavailable on the ground.
The possibility of being forced to play behind closed doors without the team's supporting players was raised due to fear of lack of transport.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species had evolved in just two generations, though many had thought that this process would take much longer due to the interbreeding of endemic Darwinfink, the Middle-earth spur, and the cactus spur-invader, the Great Cactus spur.
Gold can come in all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can also be twinned and braided, it can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
The color of the juice will change depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is marked by the number of hydrogenions (H in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogenions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms are one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this feels weird and creates a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a lavatory attached to an advanced sewer system.
Remains of sewerage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient times, toilets were also found in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
It takes a gigantic rocket over 100 British feet to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in great ways, and the best thing it has given us is a means of transportation that is much easier and faster.
It has given us many modes of transportation, such as the train, the car, and more.
Below them, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey animals like hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are several small caterpillars (including loose pet cats) that eat the far more numerous prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to its success is the niche concept, a special job each cat has that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live together in larger groups called alliances.
The alliances consist of 13 adult males in mating, together with up to thirty females and puppies.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion flock behaves much like a wolf or dog flock, animals that have surprisingly much in common with the behavior of lions (but not other large cats).
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump over great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-grown roar of a lion, but more like a sentence with glittered words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Researchers believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (bythed animals) by smelling, snorting, or sniffing at the ground to find where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by going in unison with their surroundings to attack the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came, whether they move over a mountain range or a river, or whether they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back, they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new population will need different functions or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor, since this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptation as before.
As the new people began to adapt to their new surroundings, they became less and less like the other population.
After a few thousand years or after millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We've named this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans inhale, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (so it's just breathing well).
Plants make their food from the sun by using photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plants, animals would not survive without plants.
The mosasaurus was the supreme predator of its time, not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper mouth, none that crossed its path came alive from it.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a false tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaic animals, and it may also have been a cannibal.
In addition, it attacked anything that came down into the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not be a match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peafowl, snails and a type of rodent called the seven-footed boar.
The fact that poor people and women ate their meals while sitting in chairs, while the rich men liked to have banquets together where they lay on the side while they ate their meals, was another difference.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods that came to Europe from the United States or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn or tomatoes, nor potatoes, or cocoa, and no older Romans have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each god and these were viewed as the home of God.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary made for the god.
Houses were not so essential in the high-temperature climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family lived mostly outdoors.
The women cooked in the garden; the shops were open disks facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land around Canaan, which made the woodwork extremely expensive.
In Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been deported from Iceland for murder, and then found Greenland while travelling westward and christened it Greenland.
But there were already Eskimo tribes living there at the time, independent of his discovery.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, although all the countries were skandinaviske.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Despite the fact that there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a tax map.
The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776, is inscribed on the back of the document, up and down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So the note was probably added as a label.
The invasion and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated North France, but South France was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French Vichy individuals, French persons who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and actually worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The invasion of southern France by the Allies on 15 August 1940 was called Operation Dragoon.
Within just two weeks, the Americans and free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a fairly large number of people who live and work together as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, thus defining the size of society.
Urban states are precursors of nations, and a civilization culture presupposes the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a linguistic footprint and a fair and lasting communication.
Minor cultures disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not seen as proper civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with the Congress as its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national leader or judicial system, it depended on state agencies, which were usually not willing to cooperate to enforce their actions.
Nor did it have the authority to override the tax law and the tariffs between the states.
The articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended, and the states took so lightly on the central government that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian and German national teams are the second best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fekting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 are well-liked sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in geographical context, as an øygruppe.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 14th century when European seafarers passing through the island gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to re-establish the native grain production practices and employed Chinese workers to work their rice fields and sugar plantations.
Forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took Taiwan's coastal areas in the west and north under control in 1683, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing dynasty signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which ceded the rights of Taiwan to Japan, which continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three important structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was completed in 1976 and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, 35 mm is still the most common format for still image photography in the world, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but even more important is that the digital camera's image sensor formats have inherited the size ratio of the camera.
It might be a little confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio), is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS family formats) are similar, or approximately similar, to this aspect ratio.
The rules of division are much abused and often derided, but are a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main motif is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized during this period of European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervasive authority affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate pain and poverty and that is why the money of the church is there.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy demonstrated the effect of cutting vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated widely accepted international law codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain internationally bombed waters to prevent any ships from entering entire portions of the sea, creating danger for even neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare as there was limited response to this tactic.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most inhabitants and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing all the fear and cruelty of war during World War I, the nations would avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for Edison's firm in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of reference from Charles Batchelor (the job page from his previous position) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each phase of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces, the best-known of these periods being the three kingdoms that took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was violent warfare between many kings who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people died while fighting for the seat of power in the great palace of Xiadel.
There are some social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the nation is ruled by the citizens instead of just one ruler.
Even after the revolution, it was open to all male seekers who allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the military, because instead of military ranks based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was the motivation for other oppressed people in the working class of other nations to also set in motion their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond the mortal life, and he often used a cave known as Hira on the mountain Noor (light), where he went to think.
The cave itself, which has been preserved over the years, provides a very vivid representation of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
On a mountain top north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It's actually not easy to find at all, even if you know it's there, because once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The only one of the seven wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza nekropolis in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, includes many pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), many small tombs, temples and the Great Sphinxen.
The Great Pyramid was made to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were made to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper stroke symbol resembles a V and the lower stroke symbol resembles a pen or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start on the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start on the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and push the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more distinct.
You can use a pencil and make your own markings, but don't forget that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be taken into account.
The royal family, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were pressed on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
The King and Queen returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening them.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows completely open.
A member of the gang at one point swung the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The Filipino people had to pay for the cost of the war's American imperialism, in the conquest of the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover large portions of the costs, and the interest on bonds was paid in the name of the Philippine government via the Wall Street banks.
The super-income derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people was a fundamental gain of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the order.
The age in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in the period of European history known as the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The Mughal Empire did not interfere with social culture and traditions for most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralized and unified rules.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology additionally has effects on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that road development is due to the car.
A nationwide road network is not economically viable if used by only a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce costs in road conditions.
Mass vehicle ownership is creating more accidents on roads, leading to new methods in the health sector to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism had a larger element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
What characterized Romanticism was that the landscape shaped individuals and that over time, geographical habits and cultures emerged, and that these, as they harmonized with the position in society, were better than randomly imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of fashion in our time, Constantinople was seen as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It has been known for being an episenter for luxury from about 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status was not the same in the 12th century, mainly due to the Crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of motehovedstad was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the attire was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
But due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 - 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style, and one of the biggest changes that came about at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to close clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-storage farming is a simple, often ecological, system that uses stored seeds belonging to the area combined with growth rotation or other techniques to maximize relatively simple yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in self-storage agriculture, which is still the practice in many developing countries.
Participatory cultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded from the social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be special because of the age, ethnicity, class, area and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that specify a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take as a starting point the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, were not sufficiently socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "wildlings". Some wild children have been held captive by humans (usually their own parents), in some cases due to parental rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical weaknesses.
It is possible that children who are wild may have undergone serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to flee.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When a wild child is fully raised by animals, it develops behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost identical to the parent animal, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
Although project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool that supports individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
A teacher can also be, in other words, a kind of a support person, but it's also the little binderman in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support functions are embedded in the software and are meant to ask questions, encourage, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an atmosphere that is not caring and learning, but it does happen.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities that they did not have in the home they came from.
It is a combination of elements of both mass and interpersonal communication on the Internet.
The special characteristics of the Internet bring additional dimensions to the use and satisfaction approach.
For example, learning and socialization are considered important motivational factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified personal engagement and permanent relationships as new motivation aspects when investigating audience reactions to websites (1998).
Using video recording, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been argued that one can find out whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks suggests in his newspaper, The President's Tale, that people who fail to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity correctly.
He also claims that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals such as pet dogs.
According to modern research, there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new gene variation and the selection removes it from the selection of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination switch back and forth between the two basins with each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to obtain adequate amino acids from the available plant resources out on the savannah.
And the consequences of not doing so are devastating: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The proteins that are in leaves and legumes would be the most accessible plant resources, but these are difficult for primates like us to be able to digest without cooking them first.
Animal foods (ant, termit, egg) are in contrast not only easily digestible, but they also provide high quantity proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
We should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" with a method quite similar to that of the chimpanzees on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of conscious awakening during the normal sleep period while falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a rather quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you turn off the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythm involve drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known watering agent) before sleeping, which leads to the need to stand up to urinate.
How much inner calm a person has is inversely correlated with how much tension there is in the body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stops us from getting that kind of insight is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded to include the love-orientation of the Mahayana and several methods from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and full love.
Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) can be awakened with kundalini yoga through yoga poses, breathing training, mantra and visualization.
Tibetan meditation is about god yoga, where the energy channels are cleansed by imagining different deities, which activates the chakras and lights up the consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, causing cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and was to be really fought, by proxy armies on the battlefields of Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places in Africa to Asia.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the last opportunity was to return and reorganize along Romania.
However, these plans were aborted almost overnight, as over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union went in and formed the White Russian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Peace Treaty and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is without doubt the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II is one of the most important recent examples of this, as the Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic to provide aid to Britain.
The German navy simultaneously tried to stop this traffic, mostly using submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first tamed about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
It began with ancient cultures and tribes keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that strolled on hills or other places for grazing, usually tended by goat herders who were often children or youths, similar to the more well-known herder.
Carriages in England were built as early as the 1500s.
Although the wagonways were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull themselves to greater speeds and to pull more load than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
To keep the spores in place, the cross-shaped skin was introduced early on, but little by little it was realized that the spores were more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the strying netting created more wear on the three wheels of the carriages.
The first full-circle iron skins were introduced in 1767.
Spasation was the first known means of transportation, and humans began walking upright 2 million years ago when Homo erectus (which means upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked with two legs as early as 7 million years ago, and two-legged specialization has been discovered in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.23.9 million years ago.
We can start by having a lifestyle that is more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to some extent to alleviate future pain.
This is often just like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and remove them.
The world has changed greatly with the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and its difficulties have become more complicated due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
A handwritten draft signed by Congress president John Hancock and General Secretary Charles Thomson was sent some quarters away to the printer John Dunlap after its introduction by Congress on July 4.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night and these are now known as the Dunlap-bredsides.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was delivered to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document, the first handwritten copy of which has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today - they are called birds.
Some people don't see them as real dinosaurs because they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind us of a dinosaur.
They have feet with shells and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
So almost all the PCs that are used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits  or bits, to use computer jargon.
Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be to find open medicine containers or toxic household items on the premises.
For first aid guidance specifically for the poison in question, see the label.
Entomologists use the word insect in a formal sense for this income group.
This term derives from an old connection with midges, insects highly adapted to attack humans.
Both Assassin insects and Bed insects are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or the house of their host.
As far as we know, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. Most scientific research is actually guided by this method.
Experimentation is not alone, however, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses by asking questions.
Naturalism and philosophy focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge became less well-established, the West became more distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that can be seen in physiology and behavior are usually completely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been demonstrated by virtually all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, and not just as reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-moving oscillators that maintain a period of independent cycles without external influence.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first proposals to suggest that DNA could be a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or in other words viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made two attempts to mark either the DNA of the radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are bacteriocline cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and investigating details of the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplace is in the village, the others drive out.
In this dynamic transportation, everyone is somehow connected to, and a follower of, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that the large carbon economy has freed the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Most people are dissatisfied with transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or about bridges falling down.
Why do transportation systems produce such dissatisfaction, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interplay between them.
Unfortunately, it is complicated to study traffic flow, since it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
Drivers are fortunate to behave with some consistency so that the traffic flow remains fairly consistent and can be calculated mathematically with a reasonable degree of certainty.
To better show the flow in traffic, relationships have been established between three important properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of the runway.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape enemies, find food, and make friends.
Most insects benefit from the ability to spread their wings backward along their body.
Because of this, they have several small hiding places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are the eye-stickers and the city flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarkhos believed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river, and it carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, measuring ten kilometers wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows out of the students on land and into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon River, is 6,387 miles (3,980 km) long, draining thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramids were still built in stone until the end of the ancient Egyptian empire, they never exceeded the size and technical execution of the pyramids at Giza.
Ancient Egyptians from the New Kingdom wondered about the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City State has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by the Vatican in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used in the daily life of government employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every citizen of the Vatican is a Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are found in their natural form in nature and because they are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of the four elements of the earth, the four elements being earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in equal order): fluid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also believed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mix of two or more metals, and remember, there's a variety of elements on the periodic table.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that a few trillion of them fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a great helper for many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been deemed of lower status and use.
People are now writing messages on PC screens, and must never come close to a sniper.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that to be able to put together a nucleus with more protons and neutrons, it requires energy.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, splitting the core again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to fall apart more or less unprovoked.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust, and the outermost layer is called the crust.
The scarp is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the long side.
They're thinner under the maria, and thicker under the highlands.
It's possible that there's more magma on the side facing us, because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become more mature and approach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about individuals that makes them want the things they want and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
As a rule, two behaviors emerge when leaders begin to lead their former colleagues: one part of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the crowd".
For this type of leader, it can be difficult to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels he or she must change absolutely everything that the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, it is the manager who is responsible for whether the team wins or loses.
This behavior often ends in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more self-government than ordinary team members, as their teams can find ways to meet according to many different time zones, something that the local leadership may not always understand.
An usynlig team that is present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p 109) is also a unique element in a virtual team.
The invisible group is the management group to which each member reports, and sets the standard for each individual member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
If all available resources are used effectively by all functional departments in an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge.
The process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can thus lead to new innovative processes that can help to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create an innovation culture and share knowledge and organisational lessons.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a way of providing assistance to organizations to improve performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, narrowing the field of research and making it more precise.
The interplay between brain pathology and behavior is a confirmation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
Brain structures and processes we've never seen before are now possible to study thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that go on in our brains.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) gives a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, handling behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control and planning of the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting analysis, voice and face recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on coming up with solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and defense, and is built into several home PCs and computer game software.
Excursions are an important part of any classroom. Teachers usually love to take students to places where a bus tour is not possible.
Technology provides a solution with virtual excursions, where students can observe museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
A great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes is to share the excursion virtually.
For example, students from the Bennet school in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the capital, each year the website is re-structured, but old versions are kept on the web for use as an outline book.
Blogging can also help improve student writing, and although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience will generally change that.
The blog author began to improve her writing to avoid criticism, as students are often the most critical audience.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more up-to-date with the world around them". The need to give what is desired to the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that motivates students to work together, and encourages students to expand their learning capabilities beyond the typical school day they are used to.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students to think more analytically and critically; by actively reacting to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others, and sketch their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada with several art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and present-day.
Farther south lies Niagara Falls and to the north, in Muskoka and further out, one finds untouched nature in all its beauty.
All of this and more shows Ontario what outsiders consider to be true Canadian.
Large areas to the north are very sparsely inhabited and in some places are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of the population that surprises many: There are more Afro-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Kapp route from Europe to India.
In the north, it is bounded by the Sahel, in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is recommended that traveling ladies state that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to go with a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would view as harassment and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be determined to say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yours (cultural differences or not, that still doesn't make it acceptable!).
The city we know today as Casablanca was founded in the tenth century BC, and was used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by Berber fishermen, Phoenicians, Romans and Meranids.
The Portuguese demolished it, and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, to then leave it abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan built the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was called Casablanca because of the Spanish merchants who had set up their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in all of Morocco.
Places where traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagins, ceramics, leather goods, hattegens and a whole spectrum of geysers, can be purchased are easy to find around the old medina, but they are mainly sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the east of the country near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which led to the demolition of most of the city's streets, especially its downtown.
Although Goma is quite safe, all visits outside Goma should be read about in advance to understand the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing up the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the most affordable mountain tours to see gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).
Timbuktu has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands, combined with relative inaccessibility.
Although Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Because of the threat of desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities of the rest of the country, because it has a more Arabic than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in north-east South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is the southern border.
The park is 19 500 km2 and can be divided into 14 different ecological zones, which support different animal life.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa and is considered the most beautiful national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card (a ticket), which gives access to either a selection of parks, or all the national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and is the place that many tourists consider to be their main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering pedestal that is clearly visible thanks to the water that makes up Victoria Harbor.
If you want the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
The bulk of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on rebuilding land along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took over, and this is a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The largest beach zone on the planet is the Sundarbans, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that is within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps - here are some of the last remaining areas of jungle, which once covered the gigantic plains.
Sundarbans consists of an area of 3,850 km2 with about one third of the area covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30 000 Akshashorts in the area.
Buses run from the bus terminal (over the river) throughout the day, despite the fact that most, especially those buses going eastward and to Jakar/Bumthang, travel between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the district buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese coast buses, both comfortable and solid, serve most districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Now 150) and Punakha (Now 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapok River and connects Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres high and have two files of 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen metres (6.5 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be in full operation from September 2017, when the Brazilian toll checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guaraní group, who were semi-nomadic hunters, but agriculture was also their livelihood.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous groups such as the guaycurú and the payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 1500s, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Provinces of the Indies", became a country as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the native inhabitants.
The three-century colonization period was started by the Spanish.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has managed to retain much of its city's character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, at the poloban in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
See the Asosiacion Argentina de Polo for news on tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo games.
The Falkland pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falklands, whose value is equivalent to that of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley above the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what is an approved payment method.
It is difficult to exchange the Falklands' currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern part of the planet and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
The cold can be misleading in winter, as the temperature rarely goes below the freezing point, but a combination of wind and humidity causes it to feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no special rainy season and dry seasons:- the amount of rainfall is the same throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but nonetheless, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
You should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, according to the park authorities, and 25 yards from all other wild animals!
Bison, elk, deer, bear and almost all large animals can attack no matter how peaceful they may look.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they haven't kept a safe distance, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odor-rich meals and keep a clean camp.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor in 1889, it became the notorious site of the Sea Protest.
Except for one British cruiser, all ships were sunk and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting led to the assassination of its leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's two harbours, there are several beaches, the most popular being at three locations.
The North Shore beaches of the North Harbor District are located in the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonsport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coastline are found.
The most important local beer is Number one, which is not a complex but pleasant and refreshing beer.
There are many French wines that should be tested, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might fare better.
The local spring water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For people from Australia, the idea of flat white coffee is foreign. A short black is espresso, cappuccino comes with a straw (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cocoa is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juice is expensive, but it's amazing.
Many trips to the reef take place year round and damage due to any of these things is rare.
Nevertheless, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and follow safety warnings closely.
Boksmanets occur near beaches and near rivers from October to April north of 1770, and may occasionally be observed outside this period.
There are sharks, but it's unusual for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean, but their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind since they now have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although there may be opportunities to book lodges in other areas, such as on a camping site, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often sell packages including breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even package combinations with airplanes and hotels.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to think about an offer or get other documents for your agreement (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the large majority of the festival guards decide to camp on the spot, and most guards consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be near where it's happening, you'll have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night even if the music on the main stage is finished.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are going over the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as driving through ice causes extreme noise for those most affected.
Cruise to Saint Petersburg includes time in the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos tend to make many attempts to maximize the amount of time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment for the guests, to keep them in good spirits and to make them want to stay.
Some arenas offer free alcoholic beverages, but alcohol impairment impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
All those who are to drive in the heights or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or cold.
The friction is low, so on ice and snow you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, there can be enough snow to make you fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snow-filled conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted all year round.
Safari is perhaps the largest form of tourism that draws tourists to Africa and is the main point of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling to the land to see the great African wildlife, specifically the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach cars and standard equipment, which will allow good viewing angles.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be quite shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a buskwalking, or balansewalking) involves walking on a trail, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, the first being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you can fight.
The rules vary, but since the end of March, the rules will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most activity tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets priced around ¥7000.
It may help to iron damp clothes to get them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if it is not on the room.
If a hair iron is unavailable or you want to avoid wearing socks that are stretched, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the drug (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have doubts, you can buy the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may come across infectious animal diseases that they do not know from their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or continue infections.
Even infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that are capable of harming or killing humans with their power, are usually not qualified as plague.
Tax-free shopping is the practice of buying goods that are exempt from tax and can only be purchased at certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging conditions for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway are the stretches between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often pass through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your head down: there are many steep climbs, narrow roads and sharp curves.
The speed limits that are laid out are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections  usually 3540 US miles per hour (5664 km/h)  and it is even more important to respect them than otherwise.
Strangely enough, the cell phone coverage is much better here than along many other places along the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are very tasty, and in Bavaria they are plentiful and varied, comparable to the baked goods of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit baking is common, with baked apples year round, and cherries and plums have their entré in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts, and many of the popular cakes taste extra good for a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but filling pastries, try the area-dependent Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry dish is based on herbs and spices, mixed with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid in the dish, a curry dish may be either dry or moist.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yoghurt is regularly used in curries, while coconut milk is commonly used in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines across the nation.
If used without additional pegs, however, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by lightly seasoned dishes, with a dominant flavor of peanuts, chili, sugar, (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stigbøler hangs down on each side of the hall and is a support for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but may be less safe due to the possibility of a rider becoming sitting still.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged after the horse if it runs away.
Most riders use riding boots with a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Then some rooms, especially English rooms, have safety rods that allow the leather of the stairway to fall off the hall if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, Cochamó Valley, is known as South America's Yosemite, with many large walls and crags in granite.
The tops offer striking views from the mountaintops, and climbers from all over the world are continually creating new routes in the endless seas of mountain walls.
Snow sports in the outer reaches of mountains, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving riding down snow-covered areas with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as skiboarders, who plan entire vacations around going skiing at a particular location.
The idea of standing on skis is very old  cave paintings depict skis with a history dating back to as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing dates back to at least the 1600s, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Australians.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not include, alpine style skiing, or alpine climbing, the latter of which is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as something like a hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than if you walk  but it is very rare you will achieve high speeds without heavy backpacks in tracks.
Europe is a fairly small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several nations will mean more visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, on the other hand, functions as a single country in this respect.
As long as you are within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
At the same time, you do not have to apply for a visa to each Schengen member country if you have a Schengen visa, and you therefore save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what kind of manufactured items are antiques, and some tax authorities consider objects older than 100 years to be antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, including the age limit being lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques despite being newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami and also important for the trade culture for many with other professions.
Although not all Sami have traditionally been involved in reindeer herding on a large scale, they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, while reindeer were mostly used as draught animals.
In our time, many of the Sámi work in modern occupations, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi area.
Although the word Gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Romanians, it is often seen as unflattering due to its associations with negative stereotypes and uncertain impressions of the Romanian people.
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you are planning to travel to, it may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult other authorities than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example might be that American citizens in the Middle East encounter situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
The guides are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and simple compared to the more detailed information elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all very severe weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, severe social consequences or loss of human life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather events include snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of storms affecting their area, as it may affect any travel plans.
Those planning to visit countries considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for enemy environmental courses will likely come up with the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last two to five days and involve acting, some first aid and occasionally training with weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning sex-correction operations abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to fit a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as variable.
In the years since September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become far more urgent.
Preoperative trans people must not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning currents of waves that break on the shore, a reef or similar body of water.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated to some deeper sections, and a rapid stream so that deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion during attempts to swim back against the current, which can be very problematic.
Once you get out of the current itself, it's no more problematic than swimming back in.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be dragged back or, depending on your skill and whether you've been spotted, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
A returshock occurs earlier than a culture shock (the stress phase is not there in the same way as with outflow), it lasts longer, and can become more severe.
Travelers who have adapted to the new culture have sometimes found it especially difficult to adapt to their own culture again.
When you return home after living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the old habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, since they know that the traveler has to adjust to a new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most exciting things in the area for kids is the pyramid's sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night and you have the opportunity to see them in peace before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors here. The story of sound and light is just like a fairy tale.
The Sphinxen is set both as a background and as a narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is the island of King George with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here are joined together into the plateau, then they reappear and form the 360 km long Ellsworth Range, bisected by the Minnesota glacier.
Mount Vinson has an elevation of 4,892 metres (12,080 ft) and is located on Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, in the northern part or Sentinel Range.
In remote areas with poor mobile coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone, as one must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to be able to take a phone.
The service is often used by ships, leisure boats and in addition on expeditions that have remote data and contact needs.
You can obtain more information about connecting to this service from your local telephone service provider.
Travel education is an increasingly popular option for those who plan to take a gap year.
This is especially popular among Russians, so that they can take a year off before university, without weakening their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
Usually, a school office will be registered in this type of education programme.
Finland is a great destination for the boat-happy. The land of a thousand islands also has thousands of islands, in the islands and in the coastline.
There is no need for a yacht in the islands and lakes.
Although the coastline and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak provide a different experience.
The boat life is a national pastime in Finland with one boat per 7th or 8th person.
Although this is the same for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (as in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
The vast majority of the distinct Baltic Cruisers had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a couple of full days in the historic city, and go back to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore using ship excursions, you will not need your own visa (as of 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the trip there is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, it's nothing different from other things that a lot of people fear or dislike.
Understanding how the aircraft works and what occurs during flight can help some to overcome a fear based on the unknown or on not having control.
Freight companies get paid a lot of money to deliver things quickly, and often time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an emergency repair.
On some routes, larger companies use their own aircraft, but for smaller companies it was problematic.
If they sent things by air freight, it may have taken days on some routes to get through the outlasting and the customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without passengers, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to fork out a hefty pile of money for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
This, however, is not affordable: as a rough rule of thumb, you can prepare to pay up to four times the usual economy fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for business rebates or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a certain group of people who are willing to pay good money to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and then pay accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova.
The multiethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994 this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. Izmir is the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transportation center.
Smyrna was formerly just an old city, but is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping centres are lined with traditional red roofs, the 18th-century square with old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more similar to the European Mediterranean than the traditional Turkey.
The island of Eysturoy is visible from the village of Haldarsvík, which also has an unusual octagonal church.
There are fabulous marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the cemetery.
It is worth spending half an hour to stroll through this exciting village.
Northward and not too far away lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, made famous by Lord Byron's glowing speech.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra and has a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you must also visit the heavily-enclosed Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a site of Marian art popular throughout the world.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave, as well as a place that has an almost immeasurable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time here, and many more who loved those who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat this place with the dignity, the solemnity and the respect it deserves, and don't tell jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Please do not damage the site by marking or tearing graffiti into structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are both Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population likes Catalan, and most people understand it, but practically everyone speaks Spanish.
Most signs are, however, only in Catalan, because it is the first official language.
Spanish is also used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular messages at Metro stations are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system with a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The reputation of Parisians is that they are egotistical, impudent and arrogant.
Although it is often only an uncertain stereotype, the best way to get far in Paris is still to behave as one who is bien élevé (well-committed).
The Parisian fast-paced façade quickly disappears if you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by a lot of forest, mainly of beech, grass and grain trees, and is characterized by a mixture of high mountain and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soil and varying levels of elevation.
The area also houses a very large number of animals and bird species.
There is a rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, gaupe, wildcat and tiur, in addition to several common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer scarves to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially if it has bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men are required to wear trousers that go over the knees.
These may also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes may not have been washed after each use, so it may be less comfortable to walk in these skirts.
Mallorca's cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially flax), and uses olive oil for everything.
A light and well-liked dinner, at least in summer, is Pa amb Oli: a slice of olive oil, tomatoes and any accessories such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All nouns that are used with the word Sie for you always start with a capital letter, even if it's in the middle of a sentence.
This is a significant method for distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It also makes the reading easier, even if the writing is a little difficult, since you have to figure out if a verb or adjective is being used in a substantive form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters that you have to be careful of are c and g, because their pronunciation is different based on the following vowel.
In addition, you should be careful since the pronunciation of r and rr is different: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and fairly straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
If you already know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish quickly find that Portuguese is close enough that you don't need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually somewhat outdated in our time and are often used for museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution was not the type of problem in their heyday as it is today, they usually find themselves in cities or at study sites that are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossoms that appear have been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.
The concept came from China where blooming plum blossoms were the most popular flower.
The first cherry blossom celebrations were arranged by the Emperor of Japan only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
The plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even just one specimen.
If you visit a formal garden and pick some "tumblings", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is usually a high-security place, it's a very easy place to get to, and you can get most things there once you get there.
However, if you are placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to take a stand against both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is not as frequent).
There are also a couple of buses that travel north to the city of Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, which is nearby.
The inland waterways can be a delightful theme to base a trip on.
Visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat tour along the Erie Canal.
They also provide popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions that we have in the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to stay awake through the Easter night at an exposed point to view the sunrise.
It may have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but there are also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Many traditional churches often hold the Easter service on a Saturday evening during the Easter holiday, with the congresses often starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
The landed turtles did not make the trip due to the long distance to the continent, and the great landed turtle became the first beetle to be found on the Galapagos.
Many mammals have been introduced after the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to discover the Aurora Borealis, as the sky remains dark more or less 24 hours a day.
As the places are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Dress is standard for work attire, and employees title each other by last name or job title.
Interaction is important in the workplace, with emphasis on group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often must obtain the approval of their superiors for any decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
