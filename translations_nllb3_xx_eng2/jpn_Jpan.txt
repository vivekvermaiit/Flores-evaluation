This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, but also gives us details such as colour and stereo-position that are not generally found in fossils.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were brown on the outside and warm on the inside.
This discovery also provided a clue to the evolution of feathers in birds.
Although dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed axis called a fin axis, the presence of cotton feathers and small plumes, which are characteristic of other feathers, suggests that the feather axis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used for thermoregulation and visual effects, not for flight. The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen showed adult feathers, not the feathers of a hippopotamus.
The researchers suggest that, although this specimen is the tail of a young dinosaur, it is not a feather of a hawk, but an adult feather.
Two police officers were killed and more than 20 others were injured in a car bomb explosion at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning.
According to the governor's office, 19 of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected the militants were involved in the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars. They found that the activity of all the stars in the galaxy is driven solely by their luminosity and rotation, and no other factors.
The combination of the luminosity and the rotation determines the number of stars that are associated with the plasma flow.
So the smaller the number, the less the star is active in terms of magnetic reversal.

This community frustration has led to the current effort to draft policies on sexual content on sites that host millions of openly licensed media.
The content was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was a tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the galaxy's dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravity causes the tides to rush to the earth, the Milky Way also exerts its force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter as well as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around galaxies is made up of many tiny particles, like a halo around a galaxy.

It's cooler during the day than the surrounding surface, and warmer at night.
"Such thermal activity is often not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the formation of deep holes in the ground", says Glenn Cushing, of the Northern Arizona University, who is on the staff of the Arizona Flag and the USGS Space Geology Team.
In France, voting is traditionally conducted in old-fashioned facilities. Voters are isolated in booths and put into envelopes with pre-printed ballot papers showing the candidates.
After the voter has been personally verified by the staff, the envelope is sent to the ballot box and the voter's name is signed on the voter's list.
French electoral law is rather rigidly procedural.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, and voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of the voters who have been duly collected.
Candidates can have a representative present for any part of the process. In the evening, votes are cast by volunteers, following a specific procedure and under strict supervision.

But the driver suffered a severe head injury.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed until the ambulance team rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Mr. Adekoya has since appeared in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court for the murder of his son.
She is being held in custody pending prosecution and trial, but her photographs have been widely published, and the evidence of witnesses could be compromised.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system is different, and the courts consider the publication of the photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists who publish photos of suspects and so on are crossing a dangerous bridge".
The Crown Court Criminal Division, which is fully charged with the prosecution, has indicated to the press that it intends to make no further comment, at least until the prosecution is brought.
According to leaked information, the document refers to the border dispute, and the Palestinian hope is based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other issues are reported to be discussed, including the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a ten-year stay in the canyon, but the Palestinian Authority has agreed to a five-year stay.
Since the auxiliary pest control tests are monitored and their effectiveness is evaluated, the shooters participating in these tests were under strict surveillance by the rangers.
The NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) have partnered to recruit qualified volunteers for the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick Offlin, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, who works with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in by the new nine-member provisional electoral commission (CEP).
For Martelly, it's the fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former European Commission as part of a move to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was created by President Martelly in response to widespread opposition protests that began in October.
The protests, which have been sometimes violent, were triggered by the non-implementation of the planned elections, which took place after 2011.
There have been about 60 reported incidents of a faulty iPod causing a fire, with a total of six fires and four minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy and Industry has announced that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 additional heat-related accidents that were "not serious".
The ministry responded by saying it was "really sorry" about Apple's delay in reporting.
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time on Friday at 9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office (EMO) says there are no reports of damage nationwide.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacks a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila and holds Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Roland Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but at least six people have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers were substituted for an elderly woman who wanted to go to the dump.
Riggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Riggins took advantage of her free time to begin researching premature birth.
His research found that the administration of hormones accelerated the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Her fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer says, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. She died on a night with two moons. It was quite a unique night, just like her.
Dustin "Golddust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even more so... I love her and I'll miss her... if I can, I want her to be in heaven".
A poll of 1,400 people conducted ahead of the 2010 federal election showed that opposition to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
In the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
A poll found that 34% of people agree with this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The poll shows that 29% of people think Australia should be a republic as soon as possible, and 31% think it shouldn't be a republic, both extremes.
The Olympic gold medalist, who was due to swim in the 100m, 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, is in a questionable state of health due to the symptoms he has reported.
He could not take the pain-relieving medicine that was banned at the competition.
On January 25, mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime number ever known.
This discovery was announced on Tuesday, after being tested by several people using different hardware and software by early February.
Comets could have formed proteins, carried life-sustaining organisms, and been a source of water for Earth.
Scientists want to understand how planets, and especially the Earth, formed long ago when comets collided with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, who took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month, is a Republican.
He called the rumors "political chatter and stupidity".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen, the FAA claims, is a system that allows aircraft to fly short-haul routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon dioxide emissions every year.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to conventional ground-based radar technology, allowing controllers to more accurately identify aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no special transportation, no overground trains stop at Wembley, no overground car parks or park and ride facilities.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the team being forced to play in closed venues with no supporters present.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported that a new species of bird was being born in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, but the process was thought to take much longer, as it involved crossbreeding between the endemic Galapagos finch and the introduced Oosa bothen finch.
Gold is a metal that can be shaped into any shape. It can be rounded and then shrunk.
You can pull it, you can twist it, you can twist it, you can twist it, you can stretch it, you can press it, you can make it into a plate.
It can be stretched very thinly and then attached to other metals. It can be thin enough to be used for decoration of hand-drawn illustrations called "color manuscripts".
And this is called the pH of the chemical.
The juice of cabbage reacts with chemicals and changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has an electron removed.
The two dry powders are then rolled together and then gently gripped with clean, wet hands.
The water in your hand interacts with the outer layer, and it makes a strange sensation, and it forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Hararpar and Mohenjo-daro, sewers were installed and almost every home had a flush toilet.
In the homes of the cities of Minoan Greece, Crete and Santorini, the remains of sewers have been found.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman era, some were part of the public baths.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, it's automatically a satellite call.
Satellites in space receive a call and reflect it almost instantly.
Satellites were sent into space by rocket. The reason scientists use telescopes in space is that the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and scenery that enters our field of view.
To launch satellites and telescopes into space, you need a giant rocket that's over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest achievement it has brought us is that it has made transportation much more convenient and faster.
Trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation were born from it.
Below that, there are many medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to lizards to deer.
Finally, there are numerous small cats (including feral cats) that feed on a much larger number of smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to its success is the concept of a niche, where each cat has a specific job to do and does not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the feline species, living in large groups called pride.
The pride consists of 1-3 related males and over 30 females and their offspring.
Usually, females are related by blood, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride is similar to wolves and dogs, and the animals are remarkably similar to lions and other big cats, which are very agile and do not miss their prey.
A very well-balanced and highly mobile tiger can climb, swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a stubborn human.
The tiger is a member of the same animal group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar. Only these four large feline species are able to roar.
The tiger's roar is not a lion's roar, but a menacing, intimidating roar.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They may also catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most of the prey they hunt is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the oserot sniffs the ground and finds and chases the prey.
It is highly nocturnal and is also a good stealthy mover. It blends in with its surroundings and jumps on prey to hunt.
When a small group of organisms (a small number of individuals) moves away from the larger group to which they belong (for example, moving across mountains or rivers, or moving to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from the one they were in before.
In this new environment, with different resources and different competitors, new populations may require different characteristics and adaptations from what was previously required, and may be powerful competitors.
The original population has not changed at all, and it still needs adaptation as much as it did in the past.
As a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, over time, it begins to look different from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
And this process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that we breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that we exhale as our breath.
Plants make their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis. They also make their shade.
We make our homes with plants, we make our clothes with plants. Plants are a big part of our daily diet. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Because they were the top predators of their time, they had nothing to fear except each other.
Its long jaws are lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, and its mouth has another set of teeth, meaning that there is no escape if you pass through here.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a pair of tongues with the ends split. It could have eaten turtles and big fish, and it could have eaten other mosasaurs.
And it would attack anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus.
Most of their food is familiar to us, but the Romans ate the lowest and rarest of the low, such as the wild boar, the peacock, the snail, and a species of rodent called the rat.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, while the rich men preferred to eat in bed and relaxing at a banquet.
Ancient Roman food could not have incorporated the ingredients that would come to Europe from the Americas and Asia in the following centuries.
For example, there was no corn, no tomato, no potato, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans who had ever tasted a turnip.
The Babylonians built the first temple for each of their gods, and it was considered the house of the gods.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the wishes of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner courtyard that was only open to the priest.
As part of the temple, a special pyramidal tower called a ziggurat was sometimes built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
For people living in the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not that important.
Hebrew families lived mostly outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden, and the shops were all just sheds facing the street.
The wood was very expensive and precious, for there was no large forest in the land of Canaan.
Greenland was a remote area. According to Norse lore, when the red-haired Erik was banished from Iceland for murder, he went west and discovered Greenland, which he named Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at the time.
And while all of these countries are Scandinavian, there are significant differences in the nationality, royalty, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But it wasn't. It had something written on the back, but it wasn't a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed with the title "The Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The title is written backwards at the end of the document.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was kept in its early days in a folded state.
So, it's just a label that's often added.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent fighting liberated the north of France, but not the south.
The rulers were the French of the Bicycles, who made peace with the Germans in 1940, and instead of fighting the invaders, they helped the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a culture, a society, shared by a large group of people who live and work together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin adjective civilis, which means citizen, and is related to the Latin noun civis, which means city or city-state, and to the noun civitas, which in some way defines the scale of society.
The city-state is the precursor of the state. Civilization means the transmission of knowledge over generations, the survival of cultural traces, and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Cultures that are out of the mainstream often disappear without being recognized as formal civilizations, leaving no historical evidence.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with the Confederation as its only constituent body.
Congress had no power to tax, and no executive or judicial branch of government, so Congress relied on the states for all its actions, and the states were often uncooperative.
The Constitution of the United States did not give the states the power to repeal the laws of the other states.
Amendments to the Articles required unanimous consent from all the states, but representatives were often absent because the states had disregarded the central government.
The Italian national football team is the second best team in the world, along with the German national team, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
The northern region is a winter sports hotspot, producing Italian athletes who compete in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has about 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, the seventh largest island in the world.
Japan is a collection of islands, so it is often called an archipelago.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa ("beautiful island").
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming the native grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coast of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Chukchi, ceding Taiwan to Japan.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the sundial, the temple of the sun, and the temple of the three windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better understanding of their original appearance.
Machu Picchu was restored to 30% by 1976 and is still being restored.
For example, the most common film format for still photographs in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
And they're still being made today, but more importantly, they're inheriting the format of the image sensor in digital cameras.
And I'm confused, but the 35mm is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this form (which is the simplest integer ratio divided by 12) is 3:2.
Many common recording formats (e.g., APS recording formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The three-part system, which some people may dismiss, is a simple way to create dynamics while maintaining order in the image.
The most effective position for placing the main subject is the part surrounded by the intersection of lines dividing the image into one-third of the vertical and one-third of the horizontal (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become the most powerful and economically wealthy institution in European history, was beginning to be looked down upon.
Christianity has united European nations of different languages and customs for over a thousand years.
Its universal power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used for the purpose of alleviating suffering and poverty, and the church's foundation is a special entity for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and funds had led many to question whether its doctrines had been fulfilled.
Soon after the hostilities began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy was effective, cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade was in violation of the generally accepted international law, codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
The British had placed mines in the high seas to prevent ships from entering all the oceans, and even neutral ships were in danger.
The German response to this tactic was limited, and they expected a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing ideology of most citizens and states was pacifism and isolationism.
The nations that had witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War hoped that such a situation would never happen again.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the United States with a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bacheller to Thomas Edison, almost wordless.
In ancient China, there was a distinctive way of marking the difference between the ages, and the dynasties that held power were characteristic of each stage of Chinese history.
There were also periods of instability in the divided provinces between the dynasties. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, interspersed between the Han and Jin eras.
In those days, many nobles were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of warriors fighting for the top spot in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, patriotism, and the belief that the state belonged to the people, not the monarch.
After the revolution, the professions were open to all men, and only the most ambitious and successful could be hired.
And the same can be said for the military, because it's not a military rank, it's a capability rank.
The French Revolution inspired many of the oppressed working classes in other countries to start revolutions in their countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the everyday. He often visited a cave called the Heira on the mountain of Nur for meditation.
The cave, which has survived the test of time, is a clear reflection of Muhammad's spiritual devotion.
The cave is located on a hilltop north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if you know that a cave exists, it's not easy to find it.
Nothing is visible except the clear beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. From inside the cave, the outside world is barely visible and the outside world is barely audible.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only surviving of the Seven Wonders of the World.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many pyramids built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, which stretches across the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids, the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Giza, several smaller tombs, temples, and a great sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is a huge tomb built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples around it are dedicated to the pharaoh's wives and family.
The upper arch mark looks like a V, while the lower arch mark is shaped like a hochetick needle or a square with no bottom edge.
Up is to push the bow from the tip, and down is to pull the bow from the frog.
The upper bow usually produces a soft sound, the lower bow a stronger, more assertive sound.
You can write a symbol with a pencil, but remember that there is a musical reason for the alignment of the printed arcs.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children -- 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles -- and the King's sister, Princess Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from the Palace of Versailles by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob that shouted and threatened the King and Queen.
The mob turned into a mob and forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
Once, in front of a terrified queen, one of the mobs showed off the heads of the royal guards killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The cost of the war of the American imperialist conquest of the Philippines was borne by the Filipinos.
They were forced to defer paying taxes to the American colonial government to cover most of their expenses, and to pay interest on bonds that were sold in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the excess profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would have been the basic benefit of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context in which the order was born.
The period of time in which this event occurred is called the High Middle Ages, generally corresponding to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history.
The High Middle Ages is the division of history between the Early Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages. It is commonly believed that the Late Middle Ages ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the promotion of technology and technical norms, to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by underlying logic related to its manifestation in scientific laws and technology.
Most interpretations of technology determinism share two general views: one that the development of technology itself has gone far beyond cultural and political influence; and the other that technology does not give "impact" to societies that are socially conditioned, but rather inherent.
For example, we could say that cars inevitably lead to the development of roads.
But a handful of cars alone is not enough to cover the entire national road network, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The increase in car ownership will lead to an increase in the rate of road accidents, and as a result, new technologies for treating injured bodies will be developed in the medical field.
There was a major element of Romanticism, the cultural determinism that writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel had formed.
In the Romantic context, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography produced customs and cultures that were more in harmony with the social environment and more superior to the laws that were arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is known in the modern world as the center of fashion, Constantinople was the center of fashion in feudal Europe.
The city's reputation as a center of luxury clothing began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status declined, largely due to the return of the Crusaders with gifts of silk and spices, which were worth more than the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its heyday in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
The original decoration was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
But because of the slow communication routes, the Western style may be 25 or 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a form of agriculture that produces only enough food to feed the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple system of farming, often organic, that maximizes yields by combining preserved seeds that are native to an ecosystem with rotational cropping and other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, a trend that is still seen in many developing countries.
Subculture is a culture where people who feel alienated from society's standards come together to nurture their own identity.
The characteristics of a subculture may be determined by the age, ethnicity, class, location, gender, etc. of its members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of these elements.
Members of a subculture often show their membership in a unique symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerism, and crypticism.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite a few unfortunate cases of children who were prevented from adapting to society by adults during their development, either through neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "wild children" or "feral children". Wild children may be incarcerated by humans (usually their own parents), or may be abandoned by parents who refuse to raise children with severe intellectual and physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse and trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Some of them were raised by animals, some of them were living on their own in the wild.
Wild animals raised by non-human animals exhibit behavior that is almost identical to that of the animal (in physical terms), such as fear of humans or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning, it's about supporting people with new computer programs, starting new projects, having new learning experiences.
There's both virtual and real scaffolding. In other words, teachers are a form of scaffolding, and so are the Microsoft Office clip dolls.
The virtual scaffold is built into the software to allow students to ask, instruct and explain procedures that might be difficult on their own.
The reasons why children are placed in foster care range from abandonment to abuse and even blackmail.
Every child should be raised in a nurturing, caring, educating environment, and wild children are growing up in an environment that doesn't have that.
We recognize that foster care is a safe haven for these children.
The foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving parenting, a reliable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care system is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the family before the adoption.
The Internet is an environment that combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The salient features of the Internet bring out a further dimension in terms of approaches to use and satisfaction.
For example, it has been suggested that learning and socialization are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "continuous relationship" were identified as new motivational aspects when Eighmey & McCord (1998) investigated audience response to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting facial expressions, or facial movements, that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, they claim that by accurately interpreting facial expressions, they can tell if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", points out that even people with brain damage who can't understand speech can correctly assess honesty.
He even suggests that such a capacity to interpret human behavior is common to animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two gene pools for genetic variation, both expressed and latent.
Mutations add new genetic mutations and remove them from the pool of mutations that they express by selection.
The sharing and interbreeding of the two pools, the shuffling of mutations between the two pools, every generation.
It is difficult for primates with human-like digestive systems to obtain essential amino acids from plant resources available in the savanna environment.
And if you don't, it can lead to serious conditions like stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources were proteins in leaves and beans, which are nutrients that are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ant, shellfish, eggs) are good sources of protein, containing all the essential amino acids, but are easy to digest.
All things considered, it's no wonder that our ancestors solved the protein problem as well as the chimpanzees on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep time and then falling asleep after a period of time (about 10 minutes and 60 seconds).
This is made easier by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring back consciousness without waking up completely.
If you notice that you're unconsciously turning off the alarm, put the watch on the other side of the room, and you can't turn it off unless you get out of bed.
Other biorhythmic approaches include drinking plenty of water (especially water or diuretic tea) before bedtime and having to get up to urinate.
The degree of peace of mind is inversely related to the degree of physical and mental tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can become enlightened. The only thing that prevents this goal is one's own anxiety and negative feelings.
Tibetan Buddhism is a faith based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded to incorporate many techniques from the compassion of the Great Ascendant Buddhism and Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of loving kindness to all.
Kundalini yoga is a combination of yoga poses, breathing, mantras and mudras, all of which are aimed at awakening the kundalini, the soul of the self.
The central Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, and this led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the two countries became antagonistic, due to conflicts of institutions, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
And it lasted for 40 years, and it was a real war, waged by proxy armies in the battlefields of Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became a thing of the past almost overnight, after more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army invaded the eastern part of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties (both bilateral and multilateral), forming the Belorussian Front and the Ukrainian Front.
Shipping is the most efficient way to transport a large number of people and goods across the sea.
Traditionally, the Navy's job was to ensure that its ability to transport its own people and supplies was maintained while simultaneously disrupting its enemy's ability to transport its own people and supplies.
The most recent and most notable example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this transport, mainly by using U-boats.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany would probably have conquered Britain like the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats is believed to have begun about 10,000 years ago, with its center in the western Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise goats, whose milk, wool, meat and skin were readily available.
Generally, the goats were kept free in the hills and other pastures, but the goat herders were usually boys. This practice continues today.
In England, there were already freight tracks in the 16th century.
The wagon road was just a series of parallel plates, pulled by horses, that could transport larger loads at a higher speed than the rough roads of the time.
The pillow was introduced at a fairly early stage to secure the rails in their proper position. In time, it was gradually found that the iron tip at the top was more efficient.
This became common, but iron caused the wooden wheels of the chariot to wear out.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rail was introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and the first human upright walk began two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means "man standing upright".
Our direct ancestor, Australopithecus, was not accustomed to continuing to walk upright for more than a certain amount of time.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, but the bipedal characteristics are confirmed in the fossil Australopithecus, 390 to 42 million years ago.
You can start living a cleaner life, you can join the environmental movement, you can become an activist to help alleviate some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is like symptom-solving therapy, but it's not just about finding a temporary solution, it's about finding the root cause of the problem and disabling it.
It is a well-known fact that the world has changed greatly as a result of the advancement of human science and technology, and that problems have increased as a result of overpopulation and luxurious living.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the John Dunlap Company printing plant a few blocks away.
150 to 200 copies were made in one night, and it's now called "The Dunlap Broadside".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the Independence Hall Garden.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to the troops in New York on July 9, and the other arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Broadsides known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the text. No handwritten original has survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a certain group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today, and we call them birds.
And there are many people who don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and they can fly.
But even today, birds are similar in many ways to dinosaurs.
It had claws and claws, it was an egg-fetus, and it walked on two hind legs like a tyrannosaurus.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in binary numbers.
Binary numbers are represented by two values, 0 or 1, and to use computer terminology, these numbers are called binary numbers or bits.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Vomiting and other symptoms are common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most obvious sign of internal intoxication is the opening of a container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label of the toxin and see if there are any emergency instructions for that particular toxin.
Insectologists use the term "insect" in the formal sense of the term for this group of insects.
This name comes from the fact that the toco-target was a highly adaptable parasitic pest of humans that had been spreading in beds since ancient times.
Both the loggerhead and the loggerhead sea turtle are perennials, adapted to live in the nests and homes of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is known as the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
Some couples may decide that raising children is not in the best interests of either parent.
These couples can use the adoption system for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents lose custody of the child and another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to explain how the world works by the scientific method, which is, in fact, the guideline for most scientific research.
But that's not all. Experiments are tests used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions or making observations are also guidelines for scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers were interested in the classics, especially the Bible, which was written in Latin.
What was accepted was Aristotle's view of all things scientific, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West realized that it was being cut off from its roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often decisively dependent on the presence of an innate cycle and the mechanisms that are inscribed through the body clock.
Cyclic rhythms are not just responses to cyclic signals from the outside, but are recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The internal clock is an independent resonator that continues to circulate freely for a certain period of time, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most influential experiments suggesting that DNA is genetic material.
And then, in the next video, we'll see how this works.
They did two experiments: one was to label the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, and the other was to label the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a reproductive cell.
Only mutations in reproductive cells are passed on to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death and cancer.
Tourism that emphasizes contact with nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and information gathering about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people who leave a small country town to go to work are different from people who have a job near where they left.
In this dynamic transportation, everyone is connected to and supports the transportation system based on their own car in some way.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone who is socially active uses transportation. Almost everyone is unhappy with the transportation system.
In developed countries, we rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do the transportation companies make such complaints and fail on a daily basis? Is it just the incompetence of the transportation engineers? Or is there a more fundamental problem?
Traffic flow studies are the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study traffic flow because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range, and therefore traffic flows tend to have some degree of reasonable consistency, which can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, correlations have been established between three main characteristics: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have become able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows for a wider range of narrow spaces to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings are the frogs and toads.
Thousands of years ago, a scientist named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many people believed the opposite, that the sun and the other stars in the solar system moved around the earth.
And it makes sense, because you don't feel the Earth moving.
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, with eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is the widest river on Earth, stretching six miles in some places.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the world to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The mainstream of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. The river collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the pyramids of Giza were surpassed by others in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were built over a thousand years ago.
The Vatican City State has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous.
In the Vatican City State, Italian is used in law and official communication.
The language used in everyday life by most people working in Vatican City is Italian, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City State are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements of gold, silver, and copper have been known to be treasured by people since ancient times, and all of them are found in nature in their natural forms and can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things were composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is very close to the four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, in that order. His theory also suggested that they transform into new matter to form what we see in this world.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
So, the elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
Also, some nonmetals, such as carbon, are classified as alloys.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
And since atoms are so tiny, it's possible that there could be trillions of atoms in the last period of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing systems, the pencil's status and use declined.
Now more people are typing messages on the computer screen, and no longer need to cut a pencil.
And I wonder what will happen to the keyboard if something new comes along.
A nuclear bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to gather many protons and neutrons into one nucleus.
It's like rolling a heavy truck up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and those nuclei tend to split without doing much.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the Earth's crust is about 70 kilometers in front and about 100 kilometers behind.
The sea is thin beneath, the highlands are thick.
Because the crust is thin, there can be more sea nearby.
Content theory is about finding what's going to excite and appeal to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories consider the motivations that certain people have for wanting certain things on a daily basis, and the environmental factors that make or make them not do certain things.
The two most common content theories are Maslow's desire stage theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager is leading a former colleague, there are two behaviors that can occur. One is the behavior of trying to remain "one of the colleagues".
This type of manager is not good at making decisions about reviews, disciplining, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and determining where responsibility lies.
And the opposite of that is that the team that felt it had to change everything in its own hands became an unrecognizable individual.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a rift between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same level of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a window to a physical group directly underneath.
Virtual teams may hold meetings in time zones, but this is difficult for local management to understand, so members are more likely to have greater autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team, the people who are in charge of the people. The invisible team sets the standards for the people.
Why would organizations want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
If all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of the organization, creativity and inventiveness can be generated.
As a result, the process by which organizations work together to overcome obstacles can lead to new and innovative processes to meet customer needs.
So, for organizations to be innovative, we need to create a culture of innovation, not just knowledge sharing and organizational learning, through leadership.
Angel describes the continuum approach as a way to help organizations reach higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, which narrows the field and allows for more precise research.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is something that scientists have been working on.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, tumors, can affect behavior and change some of the mental functions.
The rise of new technology has allowed us to see and study brain structures and processes that were previously unknown.
This has given us a lot of information and material that can help us build a simulation model to understand human psychology.
AI, although strongly science fiction, is a very important area of computer science, where behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptation are processed by machines.
AI research involves building machines that automate tasks that require intelligence.
For example, it has control, planning, scheduling, customer diagnostics and answering questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
And that's another area that focuses on solving real-life problems.
Today, AI systems are incorporated into some of the software of home computers and video games, but are also used more frequently in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Most of the classes are outdoor learning. Teachers often take students to places that they cannot go on a bus trip.
Technology provides a way of learning through virtual social science observation. Students can, while in the classroom, view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, and admire beautiful art.
And, of course, sharing learning outside of school is a great way to look back on travel and share experiences in future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trips to the state capital, and the website is updated every year, but the old website is kept online for viewing as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Students who have just started blogging tend to improve their grammar, but having readers will change that.
Students are often the most critical readers, so blog writers begin to make an effort to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students more aware of the world around them". The need to engage the audience makes students grow into smarter, more interesting people (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools that promote collaboration and encourage students to expand their learning beyond the confines of traditional classroom.
By using blogs appropriately, "students' analytical and critical skills are enhanced. By responding positively to Internet material, students can define their own position in the context of what others have written, and express their own views on specific issues". (Oravec, 2002)
Ottawa is a fascinating bilingual capital of Canada, with numerous galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and further north are the untouched beauties of Muscocca and beyond.
All of this makes Ontario stand out, and it's considered a very Canadian province by third parties.
And there are also large areas in the north that are sparsely populated, that are largely uninhabited.
And the demographic comparison that many people are surprised to see is that there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is the largest island outside the group, and a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife habitat.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France, and some are famous luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, which was widely accepted in the Comoros and the Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope, and from there began the European influence and colonialism.
It is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: We recommend that female travelers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital relationship.
It's effective to have a ring (not too high).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what is called harassment, and it is not uncommon for women to be followed or grabbed by the arm.
When rejecting a man's invitation, be bold and firm in your stance. (No matter what the cultural differences, you don't have to give in to compulsive invitations!)
The foundations of the modern city of Casablanca were laid by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, called the Amphas. Later, the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merinid dynasty used the site as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed it, rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, but eventually abandoned the city after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt as Darul Badia by the Sultan of Morocco and renamed Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established a trading post.
Casablanca is one of the most unlikely places to shop in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tazin, pottery, leather goods, and hookah, all of which are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the streets, especially the town center.
Goma is pretty safe, but if you're going to go anywhere other than Goma, you need to research and understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
The city is home to the Nilragongo volcano and is one of the cheapest places in Africa to track mountain gorillas.
The usual fare for travel in Goma is 500 Congo francs for short distances.
The name "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant land, coupled with its inaccessibility.
Timbuktu today, with its reputation as a tourist destination, has an airport, but is a poor town.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger to protect it from the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS special Wonders of the African World produced by Henry Louis Gates.
It's a city that has a more Arabic feel than an African city, and an atmosphere that's a contrast to the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, each with a different wildlife.
It is one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and is considered the crown jewel of the South African National Parks.
Like all national parks in South Africa, this park has a daily maintenance fee and an entrance fee.
The Wild Card is a ticket that allows you to enter all the major parks in South Africa or all the national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is, as its name suggests, a territory of Hong Kong and a popular tourist destination.
The buildings that line the Hong Kong skyline are likened to a sparkling bar graph, due to the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kyung Loong waterfront.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated in the dry settlements along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonialists claimed their territory, so if you're looking for evidence of colonial times, this is the place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the inland parts of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forests in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not just a swamp of mangroves. It includes the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Hindu plains.
The Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water bodies/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and is now home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 Akshasijicas.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most buses, especially those heading east and those heading to Jakar/Bumtan, leave between 6:30 am and 7:30 am.
The buses are often full, so we recommend that you buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by Japanese-made coaster buses, all of which are comfortable and sturdy minibuses.
For transportation to nearby places like Palo (about 150 Nm) or Punakha (about 200 Nm), it is convenient to use a taxi.
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cantilever bridge over the Oiapoque River that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with the city of Saint-Georges-de-Loy-Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 m high and 378 m long, and the bridge has two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The upper space under the bridge is 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011 and was not opened until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully open in September 2017, after the completion of the Brazilian customs inspection.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous people in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by groups such as the Guaicul and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous people met, and Paraguay, once called the "giant state of the West Indies", was born.
The Spanish colonial period began, and it lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has retained many of its indigenous characteristics and uniqueness.
Argentina is famous for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest event of the year will be held in December at the Lascanitas Polo Grounds.
Small tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times.
For the dates of the polo tournaments and where to buy tickets for the matches, please check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the equivalent of one pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange at the only bank on the island, in Stanley, across from FIC West.
The British pound is generally available anywhere on the island, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly available.
On the islands, you can use British and US currency, but probably not credit cards. Check with the owner in advance about possible payment methods.
Since it is impossible to exchange the Falkland currency after leaving the island, please exchange it before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when the northern hemisphere winters, it becomes summer, and when the northern hemisphere summers, it becomes winter.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures in excess of 30°C are common in the summer.
It is rare for temperatures to be below freezing, but the relationship between wind and humidity can make it feel colder than the temperature indicated by the thermometer.
There is no "rainy season" or "dry season", the amount of rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but still, wild animals are wild, so we shouldn't feed them or surprise them.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards (100 meters) from bears and wolves and 25 yards (25 meters) from other wildlife!
Even though they look like adults, bison, herons, American herons, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of travelers are injured because they didn't keep proper distance. These wild animals are large and potentially dangerous, so please do not enter the grounds.
Also, avoid carrying and cooking smelly food, and keep your camp clean, as the smell attracts wildlife such as bears.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is on the island of Opole and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia is a city founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour is famous for the naval skirmish in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser were sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Maoist movement, the town's chief executive, Tupua Tamaseze Learrofi III, was killed in a peaceful rally.
Auckland has two harbours and many beaches. The popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shore Beach (North Harbor District) is located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them can swim safely on the sandy beaches, and the shade of the pohuchtukawa trees can protect them from the sun.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Mission Bay and the Waitemata Harbour in St. Helier, an upscale suburb of central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with various shops lining the shore.
The main ground beer is called "Number One", although it is not a sophisticated beer, it is a refreshing and clear beer. The other ground beer is called "Manta".
And there's French wine, but it's a long trip, so let's try some New Zealand or Australian wine.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to get.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. Short black is espresso, cappuccino is creamy, and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is a drink that meets Belgian standards. Fruit drinks are expensive, but they are delicious.
Trips to the reef are made throughout the year and injuries due to the above causes on the reef are rare.
However, please follow the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The sea gull is found from October to April in the north of the 1770s, near the coast and estuary. It is also occasionally seen outside this period.
Although there are crocodiles, they rarely attack humans. Most crocodiles swim away from humans.
The saltwater crocodile does not live in the sea, but in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travellers the assurance that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Many travel agencies have contracts with specific hotels, but other accommodation such as camping sites can also be booked through travel agencies.
Usually, travel agencies offer breakfast, transportation between the airport and the hotel, or a combined airline ticket and hotel package.
You can also postpone the reservation if you need time to think about the offer and to get other documents (such as visas) to take with you to the destination.
However, for any changes or requests, please contact the travel agency first, not the hotel directly.
At some festivals, the majority of festival attendees are required to camp inside the venue, which most participants consider to be an important part of the experience here.
If you want to experience it on the ground, you have to arrive early and secure a campsite where you can hear the music.
Please note that even after the music on the main stage has ended, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals have special campgrounds for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin. The cabin is the most affected when you are crossing the ice, and there is a terrible noise.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes the time spent in the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from visas (please check the conditions).
Casinos are usually designed to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. Usually, they have no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
Casinos usually provide special meals and entertainment to keep guests happy and entertained.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages. But since drunkenness impairs judgment, any good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Those who drive in high latitudes and in the mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and icebergs.
Snow tracks and icy roads have less friction, and you can't drive like you would on asphalt roads.
When a blizzard hits, it can drop enough snow to stop you in just a few minutes.
Also, snow and wind can limit visibility, with glaciers and ice covering the windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, where snow and ice are common, traffic is almost uninterrupted all year round.
Safari is perhaps the best tourist attraction in Africa, and a tourist highlight for many.
A safari is a trip on land with the purpose of observing wildlife in Africa, especially those on the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and squirrels, tend to come close to cars, so you can see them clearly with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are all unusually blind, so they have to wear binoculars to see better.
A walking safari (also known as a bushwalk, hiking safari, or walking tour) is a project to walk around a safari zone for a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice since its 1964 edition.
If you have booked your 2020 flight or accommodation before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for the event are expected to be in the 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen price range, with regular tickets expected to be around 7,000 yen.
Wet clothes are easier to dry with ironing. Many hotels will lend them to you if you ask, even if you don't have irons and ironing boards in your room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you want to dry socks without an iron, you can use a dryer.
Be careful not to overheat the raw material (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are various methods of water treatment, some of which are advanced and effective against specific risks to drinking water quality.
Some areas boil in a minute, some areas take several minutes to boil.
The filter's effectiveness varies, but if you're concerned, consider buying sealed bottled water from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them in their own habitat.
Pests can spoil food, sting the skin, and in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, and transmit infections.
Infectious organisms themselves, or dangerous animals that kill people without any force, are not usually considered harmful organisms.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from excise or goods tax in a particular place.
Travelers to high tax countries can save a considerable amount of money, especially on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most undisturbed section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, and frequently passes through isolated, untouched forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful and be careful in steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The speed limit is clearly lower than the previous sections, generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the speed limit is considered more important than the other sections.
But, strangely enough, there is a good deal of cell phone service here compared to many other areas, like Pennsylvania Whales.
German pastries are very tasty, and in Bavaria, they are similar to the pastries of neighboring Austria to the south, and there are many varieties.
Fruit-based sweetbreads are common, apples are cooked throughout the year, and sacrambos and plums are available in the summer.
Many German pastries use tree nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts. Popular cakes are especially well suited to strong coffee.
If you want a thick, small-scale pastry, try something called berliner, puffan coupon, or clapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of meat and vegetables cooked with herbs and spices.
Curries are classified as either "dry" or "wet" depending on their water content.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries, and in the coastal regions of southern India and the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine is a collection of the many different regional dishes found throughout the country, from the 17,000 islands that make up the country.
However, when used without any further qualification, it refers to the cuisine from central Java to the east.
The Javanese cuisine is now widespread throughout the island, characterized by simple flavorings, and the main ingredients are peanuts, cinnamon, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
A leg-rope is a part of a rope that hangs down on either side to support the rider's legs.
This gives the rider a fairly stable ride, but there are safety concerns because the rider's legs can get caught.
If you get your foot caught in the bridle the moment you are thrown off the horse, you may be dragged off by the horse trying to escape. To minimize this risk, there are a number of safety measures you can take.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a slippery, smooth, rather narrow sole.
Second, some saddles, especially British ones, have safety bars that allow the camel's hide to fall off the saddle if the rider is pulled backwards when he is about to fall off.
Cochamo Valley - The highest mountainous region in Chile, the South American Yosemite, has a number of large granite walls and rock formations.
From the top, the view is breathtaking, with climbers from all over the world continuing to establish new routes, surrounded by walls of infinite possibility.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which skiers and snowboarders skate down snow-covered terrain while wearing skis and snowboards on their feet.
Skiing is the main activity of travel, and many enthusiasts, called "ski nuts", plan ski-centric vacations in specific locations.
The concept of skiing is very old, cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC.
The history of downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski travel, or ski hiking.
Alpine-style cross-country skiing and mountaineering are associated with the sport, but are not usually included, as the latter requires more rugged skis and boots for the steep climbs and descents.
Think of a skill path as a hiking trail.
If the conditions are right, they can cover a bit more distance than walking, but they can rarely run at the speed of a cross-country ski without carrying a heavy backpack on a well-maintained course.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, when you want to travel to several countries, you need to apply for a visa and go through immigration checks many times.
But the Schengen area, in this respect, functions as one country.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through multiple exit checks.
Similarly, if you get a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa for a Schengen country separately, and you save a lot of time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antique. The IRS defines antiques as those that are over 100 years old.
This definition varies geographically, and may be narrower in North America than in Europe.
Artifacts are less historic than their mass-produced counterparts, but they are sometimes defined as antiques.
Tuna farming is an important means of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many other professions.
However, the Sami have not traditionally been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived a life of fishing and hunting, so reindeer were mostly kept as service animals.
Today, many Sami people are engaged in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami region.
The word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, but is often considered a derogatory term because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
Travel health insurance and travel cancellation insurance may be affected if the country you are planning to visit is subject to travel advice.
And you can also take advice from governments outside your own country, but that advice is for the people of that country.
For example, Americans living in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are merely a summary of the security situation in a country.
The views presented are often crude, oversimplified and superficial compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a general term for dangerous weather phenomena that can lead to physical damage, serious social disruption, and loss of life.
Severe weather can be found anywhere in the world, and its types vary depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Extreme weather events such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones are the cause of severe storms, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires.
Extreme weather events that are regional and seasonal include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of bad weather that may affect the area of their travel, as it may affect their travel plans.
All persons planning to travel to countries that may be considered conflict zones must undergo professional training.
If you search the Internet for "hostile environment courses", you'll probably find the address of a local business.
The course generally goes into much more detail about all the problems described here, and usually includes practical exercises.
The course usually lasts two to five days, and includes role-playing, first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are not uncommon, but there are very few publications on conflict zones.
Travelers who are going to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid identification documents with them when they return home.
There are various governmental intentions to issue passports without gender indication (with a gender field "X") or to issue documents with updated names and gender according to one's wishes.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very diverse.
And in the years after 9/11, security checkpoints became even more intrusive.
It's a mistake to think that pre-operative transgender people can pass the scanner with privacy and dignity.
An offshore current is a rip current that comes back to shore, often from a reef or similar place.
Due to the seafloor topography, the return waves are concentrated in a few deep sections, where there are places where fast currents towards the deep sea are formed.
Most deaths are caused by the exhaustion of trying to swim against the tide, which is probably impossible.
Once you're out of the current, it's not that hard to swim back in.
You may want to aim for a place where you will never be caught in the waves again, or if you are not confident in your swimming ability, you may want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock may occur earlier, last longer, and be more severe than culture shock.
Travelers who are easily adapted to a new culture may have difficulty adapting to the native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you lose the habits of your native culture as much as you adapt to a new culture.
If you're traveling abroad for the first time, you're probably going to be treated with patience and understanding, because you know that travelers need to adapt.
People may not expect that travelers will require patience and understanding even when they return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the events that children especially enjoy in this tourist destination.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see the pyramids in silence before the opening.
Usually, here you can hear the sounds of tourists and traders. The story of sound and light is like a comic book.
The Sphinx is the background of a long story and the narrator.
The pyramids are illuminated by the light of the night sky.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, has the most bases claimed by any country, with 16 active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Vija Las Estrellas is located.
There are also Livingston Island, Deception, and the still-active volcano's flooded caldera, which extends into a magnificent natural harbor.
Elsworthland is located in the southern part of the peninsula, surrounded by the Beringhausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula merge to form the plateau, and merge again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern Sentinel Range contains the highest peak in Antarctica, Mount Vinson, which rises to 4,892 m (15,980 ft).
In remote areas where cell phone radios are not available, satellite telephones may be the only option.
Satellite phones are not a replacement for cell phones, because to make a call, you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite.
The service is frequently used by cruise ships, including pleasure craft, and expeditions requiring data and voice in remote locations.
The telephone company in your area will provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
The option of traveling to study is becoming more popular among students planning a gap year.
It's especially popular with college graduates who are at a loss for their way, and who can take advantage of it to take a year off before they go to college without hurting their academic record.
In many cases, taking a gap year course abroad makes it easier to actually go to university after returning home.
Usually, these programs charge tuition.
Finland is a country for boating. Finland, the "Land of a Thousand Lakes", has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht on an archipelago or a lake.
The islands and the largest lakes are large enough to be sailed in, but small boats and kayaks are also a different experience.
In Finland boating is a national pastime, and one in seven to eight Finns own a boat.
This is roughly equivalent to Norway, Sweden, New Zealand, but in other countries it's very rare -- for example, in the Netherlands, 1 in 40 people.
Most Baltic Sea cruises feature a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
So, you can spend two or three days in a historic city, sleeping on a boat at night.
If you are landing only for boat tourism, you do not need to obtain a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany, in their guidebooks. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and city tours are not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially those who have never flown or experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of, it's something that so many people have a personal fear of, or dislike of.
Understanding how an airplane works and how it behaves in flight can help us overcome our fear of the unknown and of what we cannot control.
Couriers are highly compensated for their fast delivery. In many cases, it is important that business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for emergency repairs arrive in a short time.
Some routes have their own trains, but other routes and small businesses have had problems.
When air cargo was sent, it could take days to unload or clear customs by air.
To get them through quickly, they had to be sent as a carry-on bag. The airline regulations say that you can't carry baggage if there are no passengers, and that's the bottom line.
First or business class fares are, of course, expensive, but you'll pay for the service. (If you're traveling, please check with your company.)
But it's not cheap at all. Compared to what you'd pay in regular economy class, business class is four times, and first class is roughly 11 times.
In general, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business class or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines charge these fares because they know that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay the highest price for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Chinu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic country, and has been plagued by ethnic conflicts.
The conflict led to the creation of the Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova in 1994, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic ties between the two regions of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Facing the Aegean Sea, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million. It is the second largest port after Istanbul and a major transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, bustling commercial center surrounded by mountains and centered on a huge bay.
The wide streets, the glass buildings, the modern shopping centers, the traditional red-brick roofs, the 18th-century market, the old mosques, churches and synagogues, all have a Mediterranean European feel rather than a traditional Turkish one.
From the village of Haldalsik, the nearby island of Estroy is visible, and the village has a rare octagonal church.
In the churchyard, some tombs are adorned with interesting marble sculptures of pigeons.
It is worthwhile to take a 30-minute walk through the village of interest.
In the north was the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became famous even to foreigners because of Lord Byron's enthusiastic talk about its magnificence.
The 403 Scooter Bus to Sintra runs regularly and stops at Cabo da Roca.
If you go north, you should also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, the world-famous shrine of the Virgin Mary.
Don't forget that what you're visiting is essentially a huge mass grave, a grave of immeasurable significance to the majority of the world's population.
There are many men and women who survived that time, and there are many people, whether they were Jews or not, who had loved ones killed or forced to work there.
Please show the respect that you deserve, and behave with dignity and courtesy, not to mention making jokes about the Holocaust and the Nazis.
Avoid defilement of a place of honor, such as graffiti painting or blade-slaying on a building.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population speaks Catalan, the majority understands Catalan, and almost all speak Spanish.
However, since Catalan is the first official language of the country, most signs are in Catalan only.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transportation.
Regular announcements in the metro and in the cars are only in Catalan, but in case of delays due to accidents, the automatic system announces in various languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, arrogant and rude.
This is an inaccurate stereotype, but the best way to do well in Paris is to be "grown up" and do your best, and then you'll be comfortable.
A Parisian, who is hard to get a hold of at first glance, will change quickly if we show him the basic etiquette.
The Pritovets National Park is a World Heritage Site with 16 lakes of various sizes dotted over a vast forest of mixed Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation (mainly pine, beech, and fir).
Because of the microclimate, the soil and altitude range is so wide, the plant communities are so rich.
The region is also home to a wide variety of animals and birds.
Rare species such as the European bison, wolf, eagle, owl, jackal, walrus, and capercaillie are found, and more common species coexist.
When visiting the monastery, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries have blankets for women who come unprepared, but if you bring something especially bright in your presence, you'll be greeted with a smile by monks and nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can borrow this from the front desk at the entrance, but some people might be reluctant to wear it, considering that we don't do laundry for every customer.
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of the rest of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, meat (especially pork), and olive oil.
Especially in summer, a simple dish called "pambori" is popular, with tomatoes, cheese, tuna, and other spices added to bread coated with olive oil.
All nouns, like the word Sie for "you", always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from the object words.
It's a bit complicated for the writer, but it's certainly easier for the reader, because you have to check whether the verbs and adjectives are used in an embodied form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, and most words are pronounced literally.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as the pronunciation changes based on the next vowel that comes.
Also, while caro means "dear", caro means "tank", so we need to be careful about the pronunciation of r and rr.
Persian is relatively easy to learn, and most of it follows the standard grammar.
Therefore, by reading the introduction to this grammar book, you will be able to learn more about Persian grammar and understand its pronunciation.
Needless to say, if you know any Romance languages, it should be easier to learn Portuguese.
But, for those who know a little Spanish, you might be quick to conclude that Portuguese is too close to learn.
The pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete and abandoned today, and remain as museums and educational sites.
The pollution that was most damaging was a different kind of problem, and it was more familiar than the modern problem, because it was happening in urban areas and schoolyards.
Many of the most advanced research telescopes are housed in huge, remote facilities for observation under favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom viewing, called a flower viewing, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, which likes plum blossoms.
The first flower show in Japan was organized by the emperor for himself and the nobles living around the court.
And don't be tempted to bring back samples of plants that are "just one", because they're the most beautiful when they're in their natural environment.
If you visit a well-maintained garden and try to collect a "sample", you will be thrown out without excuse.
Singapore is generally very safe, very easy to travel, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
However, because of its location several degrees north of the equator in the "high latitude tropics", it must always deal with both heat and, rarely but on clear days, strong sunshine.
There are also several buses northbound to Hebron, the legendary burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are about to board is not only going to the Jewish settlement near Kiriath Arba, but also to Hebron.
A walk along the inland waterways will be an interesting theme for your vacation.
For example, you can visit the Loire Valley, the castles of the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise on the Danube to the charming city streets, or take a boat ride on the Erie Canal.
It also defines routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is celebrated as one of the most important Christian holidays, the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with the holiday are accepted by non-Christians in Christian countries and around the world.
On Easter night, it is traditional to spend the night in a prominent place to watch the sunrise.
There is, of course, a theological explanation for this tradition in Christianity, but it may be based on a spring and fertility ritual seen before the Common Era.
In more traditional churches, Easter is often celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, and at midnight, it is customary for the faithful to begin a celebration to celebrate the resurrection of Christ at the same time.
The first animals to arrive in the Galapagos Islands were either swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to travel, and elephant turtles became the main herbivores of the Galapagos.
Since the first human footsteps on the Galapagos, many mammals have been brought in, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you can experience the "polar night", where the sun never rises above the horizon.
This phenomenon darkens the sky for almost 24 hours, so it is a good opportunity to see the aurora.
This area is sparsely populated and has little light pollution, so you can enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard work clothes, and it is common for colleagues to call each other by their surnames or titles.
Workplace harmony is very important, and to do so, we emphasize group efforts rather than individual achievements.
Workers are often required to get their boss's approval for whatever they do, and to follow their boss's instructions without question.
