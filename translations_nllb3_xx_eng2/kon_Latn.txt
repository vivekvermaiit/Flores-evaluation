Not only does it confirm that the tiny area of feathers on the dinosaurs transmitted information, but it also provides information that archaeologists cannot, such as color and triangular arrangement.
The gold standard says that the animal manuscript had a poor ink cover and was therefore white.

It uses satellite technology that surpasses previous ground-based radar technology to give air traffic controllers a clear view of even small aircraft and to provide pilots with precise information.
There is no public transportation, no subway, and no parking or other facilities.
The fear of not having transportation allowed them to think that they would have to play in gates without fans and without the team.
The lecture that the Rose Book held on the fourth Sunday gave a symbolic description of the Galapagos seabird of the equator.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have succeeded in growing a new species in just one generation, although this process takes a lot of time, thanks to the reproduction of Darwin's endemic pinwheel, the robust Geospiza and the immigrant cactus, Roselin, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into many shapes, and jewels are made into tiny pieces.
It can be rolled into metal, which can be melted by a hammer, cut into shapes, or rolled into sheets of metal.
It could be shrunken and bound to other metal, so that it became so small that it was cut by the insertion of small dots in the edges of manuscript scrolls called "scales of the spine".
You can make one indicator out of the juice of a red cabbage.
The water in the solution changes its composition depending on the level of acid or clay in the solution.
The pH value is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (denoted by the letter H in the pH symbol) in a chemical compound.
The hydrogen atoms are made up of protons that have lost their electrons (because the hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
The kneading of the dough with the hands of the kneader is a delicate art.
The rot leaves behind a foreign substance that, when it attaches to the outer layer, remains firm and remains a skin.
The baths of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are both home to water-bathing facilities, built in a highly sophisticated style.
Fragments of Minoan aqueducts have been found in Crete and Santorini, Greece.

A telescope or satellite can be mounted on a pole that is over 100 feet (30.48 m) high.
The pine tree has changed the world in amazing ways, not least because it has made walking easier and faster.
This has brought us trains, trucks, and other means of transportation.
Below them are hundreds of medium-sized bats, which prey on animals ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes to wild bulls.
Finally, there are the hundreds of small insects (including many man-eating ants) that prey on the smallest of creatures - insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is a niche, a vital function that each individual insect performs and that allows it to compete with others.
Lions are a friendly breed, living in large groups called pride.
The pride is home to one to three adult lions, as well as about 30 lions and cubs.
The group is often a close-knit group of sisters and brothers.
A pack of lions often behaves like wolves or dogs, which are very similar in behavior to lions (though not to other giant ape species), and they are very aggressive toward prey.
A fast runner, the tiger can climb (not out of a hole), swim, soar, and lift objects with a force that is greater than that of a strong man.
Tyr belongs to the genus Pathera, which includes lions, leopards, and jaguars - the only four mammals that can compete.
The tiger's roar is not the roar of a lion but the sound of a phrase uttered in a loud voice.
The leopard prefers to eat small animals, such as roaches, snakes, mice, and birds, and it will catch anything smaller than it is chasing.
Scientists think that wolves track and catch prey by tracking its scent.
It can see clearly in the dark and in bright light at night, and it also has good footing.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the larger kimvka (e.g., moving to a mountain or a beach, or moving to a new island with no hope of return), they often feel that they have found a new home.
The new environment is characterized by a variety of weapons and characters, so the new players will need new weapons or skills to become more powerful fighters than before.
The Aborigines have always been a people who have a strong sense of identity.
As time passes, as newcomers adjust to their new environment, they may be confronted with a number of challenges.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will become so different that they can no longer be considered one.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Specification is a continuous process and an important part of evolution.
Plants and trees produce oxygen from the air we breathe and absorb carbon dioxide from the air we exhale.
Plants obtain food from the sun by means of photosynthesis and provide shade.
Plants are essential to our survival, and they are used to make our homes and clothing, and they are a major part of our food.
The mosasaur was the most powerful animal of its day, fleeing from nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws, which are held in place by 70 sharp teeth and a mouthful of scales, suggest that nothing that grows on them survives.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it has a pointed tongue and that it feeds on worms, fish, and other reptiles, and it may have eaten humans.
It was a formidable predator, even for a giant dinosaur like the T. rex.
Although much of their food is similar to ours, the Romans had their own special or unusual food at feasts, such as wild boar, peacocks, pigeons, and loirs.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate in a chair, the rich preferred to eat together in a table next to each other.
Ancient Roman cuisine was not like the food that had been introduced to Europe/America or Asia centuries earlier.
For example, they have no corn, tomatoes, bananas, or cacao.
The Babylonians built a magnificent temple, which was viewed as a temple for all their gods.
The gods were offered sacrifices by the people, and the priests tried to please the gods by means of festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
The most important structures, called ziggurats, were sometimes built on top of temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, shelter was not of great value.
The Hebrews were not involved in many social activities.

But despite what he found, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although the country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences in the people, kings, consumers, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
When you watch the film National Treasure, you might imagine a treasure map written on the back of the declaration of independence.
Although it has a label on the back, it is not a map of wealth.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed with the words "Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776", which are found at the end of the document, in the margin.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but the original parchment (a large fingerprint measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2) is the best-preserved manuscript known.
So it seems that the letters were added as a simple identification.
The Day of Atonement and the ensuing war brought freedom to northern France, but not to the south.
They were French citizens who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and had cooperated with the occupiers in their fight against the Germans.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and French colonial troops had liberated southern France and were turning back toward Germany.
A civilization is a culture in which a large group of people live and work together as a community.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, from civis, meaning a person of, and civitas, meaning a city or a state, and the time of the people who live there.
Civilization is the transmission of knowledge, heritage, and knowledge from one generation to the next.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving much evidence and are not remembered as a civilization.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen provinces initially formed a coalition government; Congress was its only instrument, following the Confederation's constitution.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and having no central authority or judicial system, it relied on provincial officials, often in conflict with it, to enforce its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to override laws and the collection of taxes between provinces.
The Constitution had to be ratified by the provinces, and the provinces were often unable to meet with representatives of the government.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are two of the strongest teams in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Sports that are common include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice skating, ice hockey, and F1 or auto racing.
Winter sports are popular in the northern regions, and Italians have competed in both the National Games and the Olympic Games.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan is made up of, it is often called an "archipelago" or archipelago.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, where it began to trade indigenous grain implements for laborers from China in rice and cooking fields.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly annexed the western and northern parts of Taiwan and made Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main parts - the Intuhuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings around the castle are designed to show visitors how the castle was originally built.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common frame is the 35 mm film, the standard size of film during the analog era.
The printing of the Bible Bible Bible copies has continued to this day, but more important, the difference in the lengths of the pages was due to the advances in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is often confusing, with 36 mm wide by 24 mm long.
The standard ratio for this format (divided by twelve to get a correct reading) is 3:2.
Many popular formats (for example, the APS) are similar or close to it.
A third, more distorted and less effective, technique is the use of a large line to create dynamics by hiding a correct line in the image.
It states that the most important part of the subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the triangle into vertical and horizontal sections (see illustration).
At this point in European history, the Catholic Church, with its wealth and power, came under its control.
For more than a millennium, the Christian church has united European nations despite their differences in language and culture.
Its powerful influence extended to everyone, from the king down to the common people.
An important Christian lesson is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the funds received by the congregation are for that purpose.
The church's supreme authority in Rome for over a thousand years and its united power and money have led some to question whether this goal has been achieved.
Soon after the war began, Britain decided to blockade the German navy.
This tactic worked, for the Germans captured large quantities of supplies and troops, in violation of international treaties that had been in place for two centuries.
Britain's blockade of international waters prevented any naval vessel from entering the straits, endangering even civilian shipping.
Since the response was not overwhelming, Germany expected a similar response from its submarines.
In the 1920's, the culture of many nations and peoples was one of relative peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and devastation of World War I, the nations were afraid of a future conflict.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four pennies in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own system of dating; each step of the Chinese dynasty or dynasty was a different empire.
Also, there were periods of division between each of these empires, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years and separated the Han and Jin dynasties.
During that time, there were bitter rivalries between rival dynasties.
The Three Kingdoms period was the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, as it was the time of the great rivalry for the throne of the imperial court of Xian.
There are many answers to the question of how people in politics are undermining the exercise of democracy, democracy and democracy, nationalism based on the belief that the nation is the property of the citizens of a sovereign state.
Moreover, after Independence, all boys were allowed to study and those who were hungry and successful were given power.
Similarly, in the military, instead of ranking by grade, rank was given by caliber.
The French Revolution also gave rise to a wave of emigration from oppressed lands.
Muhammad was deeply involved in more than the mundane, often using the shrine that came to be known as "Hira" on Mount "Nor" (light) for meditation.
It was dug by the man himself, and its longevity provides a clue to Muhammad's spiritual qualities.
Situated on a hill north of Mecca, the cave is the most isolated in the world.
Of course, it is hard to see even if you know it is there, and once you are inside, you are completely alone.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and you can see or hear little of this world from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Gaza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to our day.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., and it is one of many great pyramids built to honor the dead Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings is home to a number of pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, numerous temples, and a colossal Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and a number of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper" is shaped like a V, and the "lower" is shaped like an agraph or a square without any edges.
The upper part means the top of the bow and the arrow, and the lower part means the base (where the bow rests) and the arrow.
The upper part of the bow is soft, while the lower part is high and rich.
You are free to write in your own pen, but remember that the arrow symbols are for music, so you should always respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the emperor's sister, the frightened Mother Elizabeth, were forcibly brought back from Versailles to Paris by hoodlums from the women's market.
They returned to Paris by car, surrounded by a mob that shouted threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to leave the windows of their chariot open.
On one occasion, a mob member shook the head of a royal guard at Versailles before a terrified Empress.
The war effort that the Americans had to wage in the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the oppressive U.S. government in order to finance the war and to transfer the vast majority of the money to Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Indeed, the money that came from the forced labor of the Filipinos was a major part of the United States' economy.
To understand the Templars, one must first understand the background of their organization.
The period of time in which these events took place is sometimes called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term with a variety of meanings, ranging from pushing technology or what technology should do, to the idea that the future of humanity depends on fundamental factors that are consistent with scientific laws and how they are expressed in technology.
Many views of Technological Determinism are based on two assumptions: that technological progress itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology "influences" human life by its interactions rather than by its circumstances.
For example, someone might say that automobiles are the products of roads.
However, the highway is not economically viable for just a few vehicles, so new ways are being developed to reduce the number of car owners.
The proliferation of automobiles also increased the number of accidents, which led to advances in the field of orthopedics.
Romantic literature is strongly influenced by the tradition of determinism, which is rooted in writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In this romanticism, geography shaped people, and over the centuries geographic traditions and customs developed, which, because they were geographically relevant, were better than imposed norms.
Just as Paris is known as the modern fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its heyday as a luxury resort began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its prestige waned in the 12th century, largely because pilgrims returned with offerings of soybeans and spices, which were more popular than the Byzantine markets.
Paris was transferred from Constantinople to the fashion capital of the period.
The Gothic style was popular between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the linen industry was strongly influenced by the Byzantine Eastern tradition.
However, because the news was slow to spread, the Western style could be outdated by 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments in the history of the crusades was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
A food-only farm is one that produces enough food to feed itself and its family.
A subsistence farm is a simple, often local, farm that uses local ingredients, stored food, and other techniques to increase yields.
Historically, many small farmers were forced to farm for their own food, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded and help them to better understand themselves.
Subcultures may vary in age, race, social class, geography, and/or gender.
The traits that distinguish subcultures may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or many other factors all at once.
Members of subcultures often identify themselves with a particular group by their manner of dress, behavior, and speech.
One of the most well-known ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to understand the experiences of children who, because of neglect, hardship, or abuse, were excluded from adult interaction when they were growing up.
Some of the animals were adopted by humans (usually their parents), who in some cases dismissed the young for being intelligent or disabled.
Young animals have been subjected to violence or stress before they were abandoned or fled on their own.
Some were said to have been raised by animals; others were said to have chosen to live in the wild.
When bred exclusively from nonhuman animals, these offspring display traits (physical and biological) that are similar to those of their adoptive parents, such as fear and aversion.
While the activities should make studying easier and more enjoyable, the scaffolding is even more effective.
The ladder is not a very effective teaching tool but it is useful to help those who are learning a new way of life, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a new job.
The tutor can be both virtual and real, in that the tutor is like the tutor but like a tiny trombone for Microsoft Office.
The virtual staircase is embedded in a computer program and is not intended to ask, generate, or explain to the student how to perform a task that would be difficult for the student to do on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including physical abuse, physical abuse, and even forced labor.
No child grows up in a home where there is no love, affection, and training, but that is not the case.
We use the Family Support program as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster-family arrangement should provide a child with a secure home, loving care, proper education, and adequate health care.
The newlyweds should provide the children with any items that were missing from the home they moved into.
The Internet is a network of networks that connect individuals and groups.
The unobstructed nature of the Internet has led to new developments in technology and technology.
For example, the Internet has been described as "a place of learning" and "a social network" (James and friends, 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also point to "personal commitment" and "social following" as new motivations, based on observations of social networking sites.
The use of video has made it possible to produce tiny expressions of speech, facial expressions that take only a few seconds.
They often say that you can tell when someone is lying by looking at the small signs.
In his book The President's Speech, Oliver Sack noted that even those with a limited intellectual capacity can discern truthfulness.
He even claims that animals such as domestic dogs have similar senses.
Research in the 20th century revealed that there are two distinct types of depression - hidden and manifest.
The revision adds a new form, and selection removes it from the order of appearance.
Dividing and adding together changes the difference between two groups in each row.
Outside the grass, it is difficult for an animal whose digestive system is similar to that of humans to obtain its amino acid needs from the plants there.
And failure to do so can lead to serious problems: poor growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest foods to eat on a plant-based diet would be the proteins found in herbs and vegetables, but it is difficult to eat them properly if they are not cooked.
Animal food (ant, red-cockaded woodpecker, eggs) is not difficult to digest, but it is rich in protein containing all the essential amino acids.
In view of all the facts, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the way that the sand tiger does today.
Insomnia is a voluntary falling asleep during sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (10 to 60 minutes).
An alarm clock can easily be used to wake you up without you actually being fully awake.
If you find yourself adjusting your watch at bedtime, it may be moved to another part of the room, forcing you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Some sleep tests require a large amount of fluid (usually water or tea) before bedtime, which is then used to awaken you to swim.
Much of the inner peace that one experiences is unrelated to the strife that is raging in one's body and mind.
The less conflict, the better the energy of life.
The only obstacles to enlightenment are fear and our own imperfections.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it spread through the Mahayana love, and the various forms of Indian Yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, involving the practice of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love for all.
In Kundalini Yoga the power of the Kundalini (the illuminating force) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation practice of God Yoga is characterized by the presence of various deities, which opens up the chakras, the chakras, and the chakras.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and the Soviet Union and the United States were allies.
During the last two years of the war, former allies became enemies, leading to the Cold War.
For the next 40 years, they fought in uncompromising battles, using the forces of their enemies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, from Afghanistan to Cuba and beyond.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish army surrendered and the only hope for the Polish army was to retreat and be ready to attack the Romanians again.
But the plans were dashed overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded and formed the Belarussian and Ukrainian Front after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and international agreements.
The use of ships is a very effective means of transporting people and much more goods across the oceans.
The ships' primary function was to enable nations to transport people and goods to their destination while at the same time preventing enemy attacks.
A particularly significant modern-day example is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the United States tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to support Britain.
At the same time, German U-boats were trying to block their way.
If they had failed, Britain would have been the first country in Europe to be conquered by Germany.
It is believed that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and nations began to exploit them for their milk, bones, meat, and skin.
The local goats were often protected by a herd of goats that walked on the mountains or in the meadows, under the care of a young man, as a shepherd would do today.
The railway was built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the tracks were made of planks that stretched along both sides, they allowed the horses to run faster and to pull heavier loads than those that were carried over steep tracks.
Early on, crossties were built to improve road conditions, but gradually it became apparent that to improve road conditions, they needed to be reinforced with metal.
The wheels became more and more durable, but the metal was causing damage to the wooden wheels.
In 1767 the first iron rails were installed, and in 1767 the first railway was built.
The first known transportation was standing-foot mobility, two million years ago, when Homo erectus (erect man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright on stilts as humans do today.
Walking on two legs is attested in fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropes also walked on two legs from 7 million years ago.
We can start to live better in our communities, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become a contributor to mitigating future problems.
But if we are not looking for a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of our problems and then deal with it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of advances in science and technology, and the problems have increased as the human population has increased and life has become more complex.
After it was voted by Congress on July 4, Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson signed the bill and then sent it to Joah Dunlap for printing.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and they are now known as the "Dunlap Papyri".
The first public reading was conducted by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Freedom Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6; he read it to the troops in New York on July 9; a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 surviving lines of the Dunlap Codex are the oldest known surviving copies of the codex, and the original manuscript is no longer extant.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one dinosaur group has survived to the present day - the birds.
Dinosaurs are not generally called dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have legs with which they can crawl, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like T. rex.
In fact, nearly all modern computers are based on information encoded in pairs of numbers.
Binary numbers can have one value or two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers or bits, in computer language.

Many of the physiological and behavioral characteristics we observe are often determined by the presence of endogenous cycles and their occurrence in biological clocks.
Synchronous rhythms, which are not just a response to physical phenomena, have been observed in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are devices that rotate on their own, without any external signals.
The Hershey-Chase study was one of the first to show that DNA is inherited.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into the microbe.
They did two experiments, either inserting DNA into a radioactive phosphorus microbe or inserting a protein into a radioactive sulfur microbe.
The effects of mutations vary depending on the type of mutation, the type of blood product, and the type of blood cell being produced.

Science suggests that this vast store of carbon has disrupted the biosphere - a key mechanism that has enabled human evolution over the past two billion years.
The whole community is involved in the community life and in public transportation.
In developed lands, we rarely hear complaints about rivers or collapsed bridges.
Why are people so complaining about transportation, and why does it fail every day?
Traffic analysis is the study of how drivers and vehicles interact between two places and at intersections.
Unfortunately, learning the rules of the road is not easy. We cannot predict how perfectly a driver will behave.
Fortunately, drivers have similar behaviors, so learning about traffic is relatively easy and can be done by mathematics.
To understand the road system, three basic factors have been identified: (1) the distance traveled, (2) the number of vehicles, and (3) the speed.
A road is a road that is designed, planned, and maintained by a group of people who work together.

Chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known for centuries because they are readily detected and can be easily mined with ancient tools.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all things in the universe consisted of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was true of the four fundamental states of matter - energy, water, air, and plasma - although he also proposed that they change and reassemble to form new matter.
An alloy is a combination of two or more metals.
The chemical elements calcium and potassium are said to be alloys.

Often, the teacher may want to take the students to a bus stop where the buses are not available.
Students can visit museums, visit aquariums, or admire a beautiful painting right in the classroom.
A trip on a bus is also a good way to remember the trip and share the information with other students in the future.
For example, each student at Bennet High School in North Carolina creates a website about their trip to the nation's capital, which is updated annually, but the old website's designs are kept in an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While many students start their blogging career with many typing and pronunciation errors, the nature of the Internet is also changing this.
Since students are often the ones who make the most mistakes, a blogger works hard to improve his skills so that he doesn't get criticized.
The use of blogs "enables the tiger to become more aware of its surroundings".The desire to beat the queue that many tigers work in is a motivating factor in the process.
Blogging is a collaborative activity, encouraging students to improve their learning skills rather than just studying.
Effective use of blogs "can help students develop critical thinking skills; by responding to online posts, students can compare themselves to other writers and express their opinions clearly on a particular topic" (Oravec, 2002).
