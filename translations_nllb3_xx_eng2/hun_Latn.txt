This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that had been widely accepted, but also sheds light on details that fossils are not usually able to reveal - such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on the upper side and light or orange on the lower.
The discovery may also provide insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed tongue, called a stalk, but have other features of feathers - feather fibers and scales - researchers concluded that stalks were likely the result of a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was not used for flight but for temperature control or to attract attention, and the researchers found that although it was a tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern suggests an adult feather, not a drawer feather.
The researchers suggested that although this was a juvenile dinosaur tail, the pattern suggested adult feathers, not a feathery one.
A car bomb exploded outside the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was trying to prove the existence of an effect between the tidal phenomena of the galaxy's dark matter and the tidal phenomena of the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon's gravitational pull on Earth causes tides to form, the Milky Way's gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy is the same.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter has the same effect on other dark matter as normal matter.
This theory says that throughout the galaxy, most of the dark matter is present as a kind of courtyard around the galaxies, and it's made up of many tiny particles.

They are cooler during the day and warmer at night than the surrounding surface.
"They are not as uniform in temperature as the large caves, which often have almost constant temperatures, but this is consistent with the fact that they form deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing, of the Astrogeological Group of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections are traditionally held with little technology: voters lock themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed ballot paper in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter will put the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict about the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope in them before voting and that only duly registered and eligible voters can put an envelope in.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor every step of the process, and votes are counted in the evening, following well-defined procedures, under strict supervision by volunteers.

He's in custody pending charges and trial, but any witness evidence could be compromised as his mug shot has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts consider the publication of the photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, says: "Journalists are on a dangerous path when they publish photos or other material of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service has indicated to reporters that they will not be discussing the case again until the indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, the document refers to the territorial claim that Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics allegedly involved the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PH is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control experiment were kept under close control by the rangers as the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
The NPWS and the National Shooting Sport Association of Australia (NSW) have jointly recruited trained volunteers as part of the NSW Shooting Sport Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, executive director of the NPWS Parks Conservation and Heritage Office, the four shooters selected for the first launch operation received extensive safety and practical training.
Martelly was sworn in to a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The occasional violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been due since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and injuring four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the accident involving 27 tools.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
"In response, the Department of Defense called the postponement of Apple's announcement "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday, 19:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Agency says there's been no damage reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Monitoring Center also reported no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists and took them hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Many hostages were rescued, but at least six others have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took over the place of an elderly lady, because she had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins, while working at the hospital, began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research has shown that administering a hormone can accelerate the development of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reports that government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremity. My first manager. Luna died two nights ago. She was very unique, just like you. She was strong. "
"Dustin Goldust Runnels remarked that Luna was at least as weird as I am... maybe even more so... and I love her and I'm gonna miss her... and I hope she's in a better place now".
In the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the proportion of 1,400 people who opposed Australia becoming a republic rose by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard campaigned in the 2010 federal election, arguing that at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, Australia should become a republic.
Thirty-four percent of voters agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme end of the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to compete in the 100 and 200 metres sprints and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints raised doubts about her fitness.
He was unable to take the medication he needed to control the pain, as it is forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to man on January 25.
A number of people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, which was then announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were the largest suppliers of water to Earth, along with the organic materials that make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, after comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
Some say he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and provide more precise information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport options, the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and the car park and P+R parking spaces will not be available.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility of the game being held behind mandatory closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported the appearance of a new species that was created by crossing the native medium ground spiny cactus (Geospiza fortis) with a new species, the large cactus spiny cactus (Geospiza conirostris), although it was previously thought that this process would take much longer, and that the new species had evolved in just two generations.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, even to the tiniest degree.
It can be pulled on a thin wire that can be easily twisted and dragged, and it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be shaped very thinly and bonded to other metals, so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH, and you can make an indicator out of the red cabbage leaf.
The color of the cabbage is determined by the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons formed by electron donation (since the hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layers, which gives it a strange sensation and forms a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of canal systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese had toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women mingled with each other.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the signal and sends it back to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use astronomical telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has brought incredible changes to the world, and the biggest thing that we have done with the wheel is make transportation much easier and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat a much larger number of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of a niche, a special activity that all cats follow, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, and they live in large groups called packs.
The flocks consist of one to three related males and up to 30 females and their young.
Females tend to bond more closely with each other as a big sister and daughter family.
Lion packs behave in a surprisingly similar way to wolf packs or dog packs, animals that behave like lions (but not like other big cats) and are very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump for long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (genus Panthera) is one of four big cat species, along with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and is the only one that can howl.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-blown roar, but more like a sentence made up of words that are whispered together.
The ocelot eats small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, almost all of which are much smaller than the ocelot itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track prey by sniffing the ground.
They have excellent night vision and stealth, so they can see in the dark, and the partridge hunts by stealth, stealing into the environment and then attacking.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it crosses a mountain or a river, or if it crosses a new island and cannot easily get back), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one it came from.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population must have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than it previously needed to be.
The original population hasn't changed, they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it will become less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants can produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We build our houses with plants, we make our clothes with plants, most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing except another mosasaur.
Its long jaws will have over 70 razor blades, and there is a row of razor blades on the floor of its mouth, so nothing escapes that gets in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a forked tongue, and it could have fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, maybe even cannibals.
But it also attacked anything that got into the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't match it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual festive delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called the peanut pellet.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, rich men liked to have banquets together, where they sat side by side and talked.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples to each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to their gods and priests and tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkuras, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary for the deity.
The warm climate of the Middle East made the house less important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open-plan stalls facing the street; the houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, so the tree was a highly prized possession.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse say that Red Erik was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was Scandinavian, the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed in many ways.
If you've seen the movie "The Nation's Gold", you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a design on the back, it is not a treasure map.
"The words 'The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776' are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, and the text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down".
Although the identity of its author is uncertain, it is known that soon after its completion the large (29.1 inches long and 24.5 inches wide) parchment document was stored in an unrolled state.
So it's likely that the mark was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
This was ruled by the Vichy French, these were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion they called Operation Dragoon".
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated the south of France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture that is shared within a larger group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, civis, and civitas, meaning citizen, citizen, or city or city-state, the latter of which to some extent determines the size of society.
City states are the precursors of nations, and the civilized pottery includes the transmission of knowledge over a few generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence behind, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first established a weak central government - with Congress as its only constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and it had no national executive or judicial body, so it relied on the often reluctant public authorities to enforce its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Amending the Basic Law required the unanimous consent of all the states, but the states did not take the central government seriously enough to have their representatives absent from the meetings.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national football team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating, and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
"Because of the concentration/grouping of islands, Japan is often called an 'island' in geographical terms".
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name - Ilha Formosa - meaning Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, reformed the native grain-producing methods, and employed Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of western Taiwan and the northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which gave sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is divided into three main parts, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work is still ongoing.
For example, the most common still-film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the dawn of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but what's important is that it's been scaled up to the image-sensing format of the digital camera.
The 35 mm format actually, somewhat confusingly, means 36 m wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (to obtain the simplest integer ratio after division by 12) can therefore be set to 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) have this aspect ratio or approach it.
The often misused and often laughed-at rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
He claims that the most effective place for the main theme is the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under the thumb of the dictator.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together, despite their differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds should be used specifically for this purpose.
The church had been headquartered in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised questions in many minds about the fulfillment of its basic teachings.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, though the blockade violated the general international laws enshrined in several international agreements of the previous two centuries.
Britain has been laying mines in international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response was limited to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant behavior of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of war through World War I, the nations will avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position in New York City with the Edison Company.
When he arrived in the United States, he had nothing but a book of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his old boss).
Ancient China had a distinctive way of representing the different eras: each era and each ruling family in Chinese history had a characteristic dynasty.
There was an uncertain period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the best known of these being the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, several nobles fighting for the throne fought fierce battles with each other.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest seat in the palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political implications of the ten-point system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and a belief in the country as the people rather than an independent ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to excel.
The same is true of the military, because instead of the rank of the army being determined by class, it is now based on readiness.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working-class members of many other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Mohammed showed a deep interest in things beyond the worldly life, and he regularly visited a cave on Mount Noor, a place of meditation that came to be known as Hira".
It's the cave itself, which has stood the test of time and gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
What's more, it's not easy to find even if you knew it existed, and once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
Nothing else can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, a world that is barely seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or the 'Necropolis of Giza' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), as well as several small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid of Khufu, several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up' pull is V-shaped and the 'down' pull looks like a pincushion or a square with the bottom missing.
Up means you start at the mountain and press the bow, down means you start at the frog (where you hold your hand on the bow) and pull the bow.
"The 'up' pull is usually softer, while the 'down' pull is stronger and more definite".
Feel free to mark your comments with a pencil, but remember that the printed punctuation is there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market goons forced the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis-Charles, four), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
Suddenly, in front of the frightened queen, a member of the crowd shook the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
To cover most of the cost, they had to pay taxes to the American colonial government, and the bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government to Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits that came from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people were the main profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the order.
The time of the events is usually referred to as the Late Middle Ages in European history, during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the advocacy of technology or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is governed by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that on the other hand technology has ""impacts"" on societies, and these effects are inherent rather than socially conditioned".
For example, there is an opinion that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the countrywide road network is not economically viable with few cars, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car rental.
At the same time, mass car ownership is leading to high rates of road accidents, which is spurring the invention of new techniques in health care to heal damaged bodies.
A significant part of Romanticism was marked by cultural determinism and was inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geographically bound customs and culture developed that, being in harmony with the location of the community, proved better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the world at the time, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Famous as the epicenter of luxury, it began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its position deteriorated in the 12th century, primarily because the crusaders rejected such dubious gifts as silk and spices, which were valued above those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At this time, Paris won the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to the 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine Eastern culture.
However, because of the slow communication methods, the styles in the West may have been lagging behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the biggest developments as a result of the Crusades was that people started to use buttons to secure their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming only to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds and rotation or other relatively simple techniques that are widespread in the ecoregion to maximize yields.
Throughout history, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow for the development of self-esteem.
Subcultures may be characterized by age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender.
Subcultures may be defined by linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical differences, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership with a recognizable style of symbolism that includes fashion, behavioral patterns, and the use of slang.
One of the most common ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to point out the example of some unfortunate children who, through neglect, bad luck, or premeditated abuse, were not able to socialize with adults as they grew into adulthood.
Some of these children were separated from their parents by humans (often their own parents), and in some cases, the child was abandoned by a parent because of severe intellectual or physical impairment.
The runaway children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised among animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a child in the wild, physically confined, will almost completely adopt the behavior patterns of the animal that cares for him, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the platform goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support that provides support to those who are engaged in a new learning experience, for example learning to use new software or embarking on a new project.
"The stands can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of 'stand' but also the little man with the big toes in Microsoft Office".
The virtual stands were built into the software to question, lead to question, and explain procedures that would have challenged the student to complete the task on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
A child should never be allowed to grow up without nurturing, caring, and training, yet this happens.
We consider foster care a safe zone for these children.
The goal of our foster care is a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and a reliable health care system.
Orphanages must provide all the needs that are lacking in the former home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in terms of the use and satisfaction model.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuous relationships' were also new motivational considerations in Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study, which focused on audience response to web pages.'
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-facial expressions, facial movements lasting up to a few milliseconds.
Especially when it is claimed that some can correctly tell when someone is lying by certain facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay on The President's Speech, pointed out that people with brain damage, who are unable to interpret speech, have a very good sense of sincerity.
He also claims that the ability to interpret human behavior is found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research showed that there are two variations of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation allows for new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of variation that is expressed.
A mixture of segregation and recombination, the back and forth variation between the two currencies in every generation.
Out on the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences - growth depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant resources to access would be the proteins in the leaves and the pulses, but these are hard to digest for primates like us unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (algae, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it would not be surprising if our ancestors had solved the protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do today on the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the deliberate awakening from a normal sleep cycle and the process of falling back asleep within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring about a state of alertness without waking you up completely.
If you're resetting the clock in your dream, put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water, tea, which is a common diuretic) before sleep, which forces the person to urinate at night.
The degree of inner peace that a person has is in contrast to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and all people have the opportunity to rest in perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that can stop us from achieving that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques derived from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, it's a path of Kundalini yoga, meditation and all-embracing love.
With the help of Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is on deity yoga, where the visualization of many deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and illuminates the consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and at the end of the war, the differences in systems, methods and cultures between the countries were brought into conflict.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years and proxy armies clashed in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize through the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were declared obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and large amounts of goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that the country is able to move people and goods while impeding the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most memorable and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to bring people and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for the readily available source of milk, as well as for their fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that migrated over hills or other pastures, often under the supervision of child or adolescent goatherds, similar to the more widely known herders.
Trackways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted of parallel pallets, they allowed the horses to pull faster and carry more weight than the relatively few paved roads of the era.
The connecting elements were used quickly enough to hold the track in place, but they slowly realized that it would be more efficient if they put a piece of iron on it.
This became a daily practice, but iron made better use of the wagon's wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans began walking on two legs about two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not yet able to walk upright.
Bipedal species are found in the fossil record of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce some of the suffering of the future.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we want to go beyond a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and we have to eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and mankind's luxurious lifestyle.
After its July 4th introduction to Congress, a manuscript draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now called "Dunlap prints".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9, and the copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages, still in existence today, are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived, and that is birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Birds also look similar to dinosaurs in many ways.
They have spiky and clawed feet, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Virtually every computer in use today is based on processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, which we call binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to allow an immediate diagnosis.
The most certain sign of internal poisoning is an open container of pharmaceutical or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for the particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in the official sense of this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that are well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the robber and the bed bug are nesting insects, meaning that they are suitable for nesting or use on the farm.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may even decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their baby
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights to another couple to raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to use scientific methods to find out how the world works, and this method is the basis of most scientific research.
But it's not just that, it's experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is designed to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to observe, which also helps in scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek language, the West cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
In physiology and human behaviour, much of the actual rhythms are in most cases highly dependent on the occurrence of endogenous cycles and their production during the biological cycle.
In most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms are observed, which are not mere responses to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps running freely in cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence for the theory that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted, in which the DNA of the fig was marked with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the fig was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the significance of the genetic material and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only mutations in the stem cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in natural sites and enjoy the view, including the flora and fauna.
Field programs include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing, and meeting the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to work, passing by people whose workplace is the same as the one they just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is somehow connected to everyone else and supports a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science suggests that this massive carbon dioxide release has detached the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone has complaints about them.
In developed lands, similar complaints about water quality or bridges that are breaking down are rare.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range; thus traffic processes generally have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically approximately.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, a correlation was found between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These contacts help in the planning, design and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings along their body.
This gives them more places to hide from predators.
Now only the cockatiels and the beggars can't fold their hind wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and indeed the other stars).
That seems reasonable because you don't feel the Earth spinning, do you?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, with a water flow more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide in places.
Twenty percent of the river water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and excellence of the pyramids at Giza.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments built by their ancestors, which by then were well over a millennium old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest and least populous independent country in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of those working in the State, while Latin is used mostly in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about such basic chemical elements as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since they are all found in nature as raw materials and can be mined with relatively simple tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought that these would become new materials that we could see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and it's important to note that there are many chemical elements in the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium and similar elements are considered metals, but of course there are other metals, like silver and gold.
Some alloys may contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the end of a sentence.
So when the pencil came out, it did a good job for a lot of people.
Sadly, as new writing methods developed, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and used less.
People are now writing messages on their computer screens and never going near a mountaineer.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like if they come up with some new development.
The fission bomb works on the principle that the collision of a nucleus with many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's like rolling a heavy truck up a mountain, and the nuclear fission releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that sometimes they split with little or no action.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the tidal zones and thicker under the plateaus.
It's possible that there are more black stones in the nearby part of the crust because the crust is thinner, so the lava is easier to get to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what piques their interest.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow into adulthood.
These theories explore what makes certain people want the things they do and what in their environment makes them do or not do those things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can develop when leaders start leading their former peers: One end of the spectrum is when they try to stay one of the guys"" (or girls)".
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary procedures, conducting performance reviews, defining responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, someone becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that everything the group has created has to be changed and made his own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behavior often creates conflict between the leaders and the rest of the group.
The excellence metrics of virtual teams are measured by the same metrics as traditional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the contact point for the physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique characteristic of the virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the leadership team to whom the members report. The invisible team sets the standard for the members".
Why would an organisation go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome obstacles results in a new innovative process within the organisation to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and of shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum principle as a method that can help organizations achieve greater performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and so it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports what scientists have observed.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and even cause changes in certain mental abilities.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe brain structures and processes never before seen.
And this gives us a lot of information and material that we can use to build simulation models to understand what's going on in our minds.
Despite its strong science fiction overtones, AI is actually a very important branch of computing that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as being incorporated into many home computer and video game software.
Class trips are a big part of every classroom, and teachers often and gladly take their students to places where bus trips are not possible.
Technology allows for virtual excursions, where students can visit art museums, visit aquariums, or admire any artwork while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing the experience of a class trip with others virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at North Carolina's Bennet School design a website about their visit to the state capital, and they revamp the website every year, but they keep the old versions as a memorial book, and they keep them online.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing, and while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the emergence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger considers the development of writing skills to be key to avoiding criticism.
At the same time, blogging forces students to better understand the world around them. Maintaining the interest of the audience encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs can prepare students to become more analytical and critical; active response to online material can help students to define their own position on the writing of others and their own view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it has many art galleries and museums that tell us about Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka, an area of unspoiled natural beauty.
These, along with many other things, make Ontario look genuinely Canadian to foreigners.
Further north, vast areas of sparsely populated and sometimes almost completely uninhabited wilderness are found.
A demographic that surprises many is that there are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are famous as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, and conquered considerable territory in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern part of the region is bordered by the Sahel, the western and southern parts by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Recommended for female travellers regardless of marital status to refer to themselves as married.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what they may perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences here and there are not acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and under the name Anfa, it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, rebuilt as Casa Branca, and then abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish merchants named it Casablanca and established their trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tazin, charcoal, leather goods, water pipes and all kinds of trinkets, but here everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, before visiting outside Goma, it is important to be aware of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
The city is the starting point for climbing Mount Nyragongo, and it is also one of the cheapest places in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
Transportation within Goma is by boda-boda (motorcycle taxi), with a shorter route normally charged at around 500 Congolese francs.
It is also used as a metaphor for the exotic, remote landscape associated with its relative seclusion.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, though its reputation has given it a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threatening desert sand.
It was one of the main stations in Henry Louis Gates PBS's series "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Krokodil River to the south.
The park covers some 7,500 square miles (19,500 sq km) and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each one home to a different type of life.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is the flagship of the Republic of South Africa's national parks.
As with all South African national parks, a day pass is required for entry and conservation.
"It may also be useful to purchase a 'Wild Card' which allows you to enter either selected South African parks or all South African national parks".
Hong Kong, named after the island of Hong Kong, is a tourist attraction.
The parade of buildings that shape Hong Kong's skyline resembles a glittering column diagram, which is further enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
Hong Kong Island's urban area is largely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the site occupied by the English colonizers, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching 50 miles from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Indian part of the forest is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they are also the last remaining strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
The Sundarbans area has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is estimated to have 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 brown deer.
Buses leave from the Inter-District Bus Terminal (across the river) all day, but most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended that you buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and have a high capacity.
The local taxi is a quick and convenient way to visit nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, part of French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 273 feet [83 m], with a length of 1,292 feet [378 m] and two 12-foot [3.5 m]-wide traffic lanes.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs clearance points are estimated to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle and maintaining subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua tribes, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Indian Province", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best water polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest series of the year will be held in December at the Las Cañitas Tennis Court.
At other times of the year, less prestigious competitions and matches can also be viewed here.
For news about the championships and to buy tickets for the T-shirt matches, visit the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
Currency exchange is only possible at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in and around the islands, and Stanley cards and US dollars are often used.
In the more remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may still be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so change money before you leave the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold - the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to human contact, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authority says to keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife.
As permissive as they may seem, buffalo, baboons, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so you have to give them room to move.
Additionally, it is important to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so be careful not to cook or bring along food with strong smells, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British battleship, and about 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During a peaceful gathering in the city, the Grand Chief Lealofi III of Tupua Tamasese was killed during a struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is connected by two harbours, and the most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific coast, and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the sandy beaches are safe to swim in, and most provide shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at the Waitemata Harbour in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with all kinds of shops lining the shore.
"The main local beer is 'Number One.' It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta.'"
You can get a lot of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better for the journey.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians, with the short black called 'espresso', the cappuccino stacked with lots of cream (not foam), and the tea served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but of high quality.
Many visitors come to the reef year-round, and injuries are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, follow the directions on the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, the cuckoo jellyfish have been found between October and April near beaches and river mouths, and occasionally elsewhere during these times.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and prefer to stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live in the ocean, their primary habitat is the mouths of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have special offers with certain hotels, although it is possible to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined airfare and accommodation.
They may even hold your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) needed for the destination.
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At certain music festivals, a significant majority of the participants choose to camp on site, and most even consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get to a campground close to the music.
Remember that even though the concert on the main stage has ended, there may be areas of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are sailing across the northern Baltic in winter, pay attention to the position of your cabin, for sailing through the ice can be noisy for those who are too close.
The tourist routes to St Petersburg include sightseeing, and passengers on board vessels are exempt from the visa requirement (check conditions)
Casinos generally make a number of efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and in the room.
Alcoholic beverages are also offered at the expense of the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
All drivers at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and it is not possible to travel on them as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, as much snow can fall as can cause traffic jams in a very short period of time.
The visibility may be limited by snow or snow blowing, by steam or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic is uninterrupted year-round.
African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and provide a remarkable experience for visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to overland trips to see the fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as giraffes and elephants, venture close to cars, making them easy to observe with ordinary equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they can be seen better with a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, bushwalking safari, or bushwalking) consists of a hike of a few hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics after hosting the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may find yourself in a strange situation.
The cancellation terms vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation terms do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that event tickets will generally cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with ticket prices typically around ¥7000.
Ironing wet clothes helps with drying. You can find irons and ironing boards in many hotels, which you can use even if you don't have one in your room.
If you don't have a cast iron or don't like to wear cast iron socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Care should be taken not to allow the fabric to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, brittle).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes longer.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider buying water in sealed bottles from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests that they may not have encountered in their homes before.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, and spread poison or infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free purchases are purchases of goods at certain locations free of duty and surcharges.
Travelers to countries with heavy tax burdens can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging for driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated, backwater areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open. Steep climbs, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are the hallmarks of the road.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent stages  generally 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is of paramount importance.
Interestingly, however, the signal is much stronger here than in other parts of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery is very good, and in Bavaria it's quite rich and varied, which is similar to its southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked all year round, and cherries and plums are baked in summer.
Many German baked goods, however, contain almonds, nuts, and other nuts, and the more popular pastries often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but plentiful cakes, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, made with meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be either 'dry' or 'soupy' depending on how much liquid it contains".
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used, while in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used to make curry.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term for the vast array of cuisines found in the country's landscapes.
However, when used without other qualification, the term most commonly refers to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with Javanese flavors dominated by peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut) and various aromatic spices.
The rider's legs are held by the two legs of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but their use raises safety concerns as the rider's feet may get stuck in them.
If the horse throws the rider, but his foot gets caught in the bridle, the horse can drag it along if he is cut off.
First, most competitors wear flat, narrow-soled riding boots with heels.
Then some saddles, especially the English saddle, are fitted with safety rods that allow the saddle to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during a fall.
The Cochamo Valley is a prominent Chilean mountaineering destination known as the Yosemite of South America, with various large granite walls and fissures.
From the tops of the mountains, breathtaking views are revealed, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes on the walls of endless possibilities.
Sliding snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, including skating on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a significant fan base, its fans are sometimes referred to as "ski lovers", and entire vacations are planned around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
The origins of skiing as a sport date back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking: also called backcountry skiing, backpacking, or backcountry skiing.
It is associated with but not usually accompanied by an alpine-style sit-up or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and with much tighter skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as if it were a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover more distance than you would by walking - but you will rarely reach the speed needed for skiing without a heavy backpack on the groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small number of independent countries, and normally, crossing several countries would mean passing visa and passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area, in this respect, operates somewhat like a country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you will not normally need to pass through any further passport control points when crossing the border.
Similarly, a Schengen visa does not require the exchange of a separate visa in each Schengen Member State, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition of what is an antique, and some tax authorities define antiques as objects that are over 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical location, with some countries having a shorter age limit than Europe, such as North America.
The handicraft products could be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar products produced in series.
Reindeer herding was and is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture of business is important to many people in other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all the Fae participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern trades.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word gypsy is often considered offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate judgments of Roma people.
If the country you intend to visit is the subject of a travel warning, this may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation policy.
You can also ask other governments for advice, but those governments have tailored their advice to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be treated differently by Europeans and Arabs.
Briefings are just brief summaries of a country's political situation.
The views presented are often short, general and oversimplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a catch-all term for all hazardous weather events that can cause damage, serious social disruption or even human death.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and has several types depending on geography, topography, and local conditions.
Extreme winds, hail, excessive precipitation and wildfires are manifestations and consequences of extreme weather, together with thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to inform themselves of the severe weather risks affecting the area, as these may affect their travel plans.
If you are planning to visit a war zone, you may want to take some training.
If you search the Internet for the words "Hostile Environment Course", you'll probably find an address for a local business.
The course generally covers all the problems discussed in much more detail, in most cases combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Passengers planning non-rehabilitation surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
Governments differ in their willingness to issue a passport with no gender (X) or a document that includes the new name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is just as variable.
Security checkpoints became much more disruptive in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who are about to undergo surgery cannot expect their privacy and dignity to be protected when they pass through the body scanner.
Recurrents are the returning currents of waves that break away from the shore, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology causes the returning current to condense in some deeper sections, and a rapid drift may develop in the deep water there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue when trying to swim against the current, which is almost impossible.
Once the current is out of control, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than it was in the normal course.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be swept away again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted, it's worth waiting for rescue.
Reverse culture shock occurs much earlier than culture shock (a smaller honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture may at times find it especially difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When returning home after a period abroad, he adapts to a new culture and abandons some customs of the culture at home.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, recognizing that travelers in an unfamiliar land must adapt.
People probably don't think that returning travelers need patience and understanding.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting sights in the area for children.
We can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
Usually, the voices of tourists and vendors are heard here, and the story told by sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx provides the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many countries and this area has the most bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among them are Livingston and Deception Islands, the latter of which has a spectacular natural harbor formed by the still-active volcano's flooded caldera.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge with the plains and then rise again, forming the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, Mount Vinson, topped by Mount Vinston at 4,892 m (1,810 ft).
In remote areas where there is no cell service, satellite phone may be the only solution.
Satellite telephony is not generally a substitute for mobile phones, since a telephone call must be made outdoors with an unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is often used for navigation, including recreational navigation, and expeditions requiring data and voice telecommunications.
Your local telephone company can give you more information about how to connect to the service.
The introduction of the so-called gap year for travel and study is becoming increasingly popular.
It is especially popular among graduates, allowing them to skip a year before college without jeopardizing their studies.
In many cases, a course completed abroad during the year you missed may actually increase your chances of getting into higher education when you return home.
Participation in these education programmes is usually tuition-based.
"Finland is a great destination for boating. 'The Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of small islands in its lakes and offshore archipelago".
In the world of islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are large enough for yachting, smaller boats or even kayaks can provide another type of experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and one in seven or eight people own a boat.
This is also the case for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise rather unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the major Baltic Sea routes offer a long stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days, spending the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore for boat trips, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures also list Berlin, Germany, as shown on the map above, which is not near the sea at all, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be frightening for people of any age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, it's the same as having personal fears or not liking something -- a lot of people have that.
For some, a partial understanding of the operation of aircraft and of flight events may help to overcome the fear that is rooted in a lack of knowledge or control.
Courier companies pay good money for fast delivery, and time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or urgent repairs to parts.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and with smaller companies, there have been problems.
When air freight was used, some routes might have taken days to unpack and clear customs.
We've been using it as checked baggage to speed things along, but airline regulations don't allow a package to be sent without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a hefty bill for privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
But it is not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay four times the normal fare in business class and eleven times the usual fare in first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for discounts in business or first class seats between A and B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay large sums for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge a corresponding fee.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, which is plagued by ethnic strife.
In 1994, this conflict led to the arbitrary proclamation of the Republic of Upper Dniester Moldova in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but the country is not recognized by any UN member.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
In Moldova, Orthodox Christianity is the main religion.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated in a vast bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a Mediterranean European feel rather than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, marble statues of interesting pigeons can be seen above some of the tombs.
It's worth a half-hour walk through this charming little village.
To the north, within easy reach, is Sintra, the romantic and fascinating city made famous to foreigners by Lord Byron's account of its splendour.
The 403 Scotturb bus frequently departs for Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, visit the Basilica of Our Lady of Fatima, the site of a world-famous Marian apparition.
Please remember that you are, in effect, visiting a mass grave that has almost inestimable value to a portion of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived their time there are still alive, and many more have loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, whether they were Jews or not.
We ask that you treat this place with the dignity, the seriousness and the respect it deserves, and don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not distort the scene by drawing graffiti or scratching structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population speaks Catalan, most of them understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the nominations are in Catalan only, since by law it is the first official language.
Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
The system notifications in the metro are only heard in Catalan, but the unexpected disturbances can be heard through an automated system in several languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
While this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave in the best way possible: as one who has been bien élevé (well-educated).
The rude behavior of Parisians will quickly disappear if we observe a few basic forms of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is a very wooded area, mostly of beech, spruce and coniferous trees and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly diverse plant community, due to its range of microclimates, different soil types and different altitude levels.
The area is also home to a great variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna is found here, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, reindeer, wildcat and deaf-mute, as well as many other more common species
When visiting monasteries, women must wear a skirt that covers the knees and also cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one of bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Following the same principle, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the supply at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of the rest of the Mediterranean, uses mainly bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and the available seasonings, be it cheese, tuna or whatever.
All nouns, besides the words Sie (te), always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between verbs and their objects.
It is said to make reading easier, although writing becomes somewhat more complicated, since it is necessary to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in the plural form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words must be pronounced exactly as they are written
The capital letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be careful about the different pronunciations of r and rr: caro means expensive, while carro means chariot.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, by reading this grammar primer, we will learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand expressions.
Needless to say, a knowledge of a new Latin language makes learning Portuguese easier.
Nevertheless, people who know a little Spanish will quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be learned separately.
The observatories that existed before modernization are now obsolete and are being converted into museums or educational sites.
In their daylight-age, light pollution was not such a problem, so they are more likely to be found in cities or on college campuses, where they are more accessible than their modern-day counterparts.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in isolated areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the most popular flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom party was held by the emperor for himself and the aristocratic members of the imperial court.
Plants are most beautiful in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to remove even a single specimen.
If you're caught collecting samples in a landscaped garden, you'll be thrown out without question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, where it is easy to find your way around and where you can get almost anything you want once you arrive.

There are some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob - and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to travel on actually goes into Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme to base a vacation on.
For example, a visit to the castles of the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to the more interesting towns on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christendom, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by nonreligious members of Christian countries as well as by non-Christian countries.
There's a tradition where they spend the night of Easter awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it's likely a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on the night of Holy Saturday, and congregations often break out into celebration at midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived by swimming, flying or hovering.
The distance from the mainland prevented mammals from making the journey, so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans, numerous mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, since the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you can also enjoy stargazing.
Japanese work culture is more formal and hierarchical than what Westerners are used to.
The suit is business attire, and employees call each other by their last name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, so it is important to focus on team efforts rather than individual achievements.
Employees must seek the approval of their superiors before making any decision and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
