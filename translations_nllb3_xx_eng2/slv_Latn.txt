This confirms the long-held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, while also providing information that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on the upper side and pastel or carotenoid-colored on the lower side.
The find also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed scaffold called a rib, but all other features of feathers  have branches and hooks , researchers have found that ribs very likely evolved later in evolution than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for escape but for temperature control or display, and although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers say the pattern indicates that the feathers are those of an adult rather than a young fox.
Although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers believe that the specimen indicates that the feathers are those of an adult, not a young fox.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observation of the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team wanted to achieve would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon's gravitational pull on Earth causes tides to rise, the Milky Way also has a powerful effect on the Sagittarius constellation.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter is acting on other dark matter in a similar way to normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is held in a ring of many small particles.

They don't have the stable thermal properties of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a more or less constant temperature, but they are suitable for deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper with the marked choice into an envelope.
Once the official has confirmed the identity of the voter, the envelope is placed in the voting box and signed on the voter list.
French electoral law provides for this procedure rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes were in them at the start of the election and that no envelopes were added except those handed in by duly registered and authorised voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process, and in the evening, volunteers under strict supervision count the votes, following certain procedures.

Police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampra Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Senior police inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused came to the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed so that emergency services could free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was later charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of his son.
She's in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but eyewitness accounts can be unreliable, as her picture has been posted everywhere.
This is a consistent practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates in a different way, and the court has ruled that the publication of the photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists have been on thin ice publishing photos of suspects and the like".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is solely responsible for the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that it will not comment further, at least until the indictment.
It was revealed that the document would address the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered would include the future status of Jerusalem, considered holy in both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority has agreed to only five years of such a presence.
The shooters in the additional pest control experiment were under the close scrutiny of the guards as the test is monitored and its effectiveness is assessed.
In cooperation with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc, qualified volunteers are being recruited under the auspices of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, executive director of conservation for the NPWS Parks and Heritage Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety briefings and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission proposed the early resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the nationwide anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, have triggered failed elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reported cases of overheating of non-working iPods, resulting in six fires and minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company had deemed "non-hazardous".
The response from the State Department was that Apple's postponement of the report was "really regrettable".
Mariano was rocked by an earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Office of Crisis Management of the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
A few hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers replaced an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature birth in his spare time.
His research shows that when added to the hormone, it accelerates fetal lung development in the baby.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two "black boxes" of planes on Wednesday.
The moon was also bowed by fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, and she died on the night of the two moons, as magnificent as she was, a strong woman", Tommy Dreamer said.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as me...maybe even more so...I love her and I'll miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Among 1,400 respondents to the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the chair of the Transitional Government, Julia Gillard, argued that in her view Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree with the demand that Queen Elizabeth II be the last ruler of Australia.
On the one hand, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and on the other hand, 31 percent of those polled believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 and 200 freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition made his fitness questionable.
He was not allowed to take the medication he needs to relieve his pain, as it is forbidden at the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever found.
The discovery, announced Tuesday, was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by early February.
Comets may represent a source that brought water and organic matter to the earth, which can form proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to find out how planets form, especially the Earth, since comets have long since collided with the earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year, and last month he endorsed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
They're predicting he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims could allow airplanes to fly on shorter routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the old technology based on stationary radar, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of the aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport will be provided and no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and no car parks and parking services and surface rides will be available.
Fearing a lack of traffic connections, there's a chance they'll be forced to play behind closed doors, without any team supporters.
A new species of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species has evolved by crossing an endemic Darwin's bat, Geospizo fortes, with an introduced cactus bat, Geospizo fortes, in just two generations, although it was previously thought that the process took much longer.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes, and it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into thin wire that can be twisted and knitted, or it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
Because it can be flattened very thinly and attached to other metals, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
We call this the pH of chemicals, and you can make an indicator out of red cabbage juice.
Vegetable juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH value of the test chemicals is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix both powders and shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The wetness on your palms will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and the formation of a crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women met in mixed societies.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back down almost instantly.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets, and scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To transport a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet long.
The bicycle has completely changed the world, and one of its most visible contributions is making transportation faster and easier.
It has brought us the train, the automobile, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are also many small cats (including wild domestic cats) that feed on much larger prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is in the concept of a niche, a special job held by an individual cat that protects it from competition with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called herds.
A flock may contain one to three related males and up to 30 females and young.
Like a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely related.
A pack of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
A good athlete, the tiger can climb (though not the best), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not as full and uniform as that of the lion, but it is more distinctly howling and screaming.
Ocelots feed on small animals, and when they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the otelots track and search for food (prey) by means of scent, since they can smell where the prey has been resting on the ground.
Because of their night vision, they can see very well at night and move silently, so the zebra hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island and it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it lived before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to cope with them.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans squeeze out of their lungs (or exhale).
Photosynthetic plants produce food by the sun, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and animals couldn't survive without plants.
The Mosazaurus was the supreme predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosazaurus.
Its long jaw contained more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, and it had additional teeth in the sky to chase away anything that crossed its path.
We don't have exact data, but it's possible that he had a split tongue, fed on turtles, big fish and other brainiacs, maybe even a cannibal.
It also attacked all creatures that entered the water; even huge dinosaurs, such as the Tyrannosaurus, were no match for it.
Although their food may seem mostly familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual holiday dishes, including wild boar, spiders, snails, and a type of rodent called a polch.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on chairs at the meal, the rich men preferred to enjoy their meals together, lying on their sides during the meal.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted chicken meat.
The Babylonians built a temple to each god, a temple that was supposed to represent the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with rites and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
At times, they built special towers in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats, that were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Hebrew family life was largely outdoor.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that he discovered Greenland on his way west and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between their peoples, kings, customs, and histories.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Forgotten, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map drawn on it.
Although there is a note on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment document (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was preserved in the form of a scroll early in its life.
So it's possible that the tag was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still unliberated.
It was ruled by the "higher" French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces occupied southern France, an invasion called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and Free French Forces liberated the south of France and marched on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture, which is the shared community of a large group of individuals living and cooperating together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which in a sense also indicates the size of society.
The culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint and considerable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces behind, and therefore cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states with the Articles of Confederation first formed a weak central government  composed of only Congress.
Congress had no power to enforce the levy, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities to enforce its laws, which often were uncooperative.
Moreover, it had no power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The amendment of articles required the consent of all the LÃ¤nder, but the individual LÃ¤nder did not take the central authorities seriously and their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national football team, and became the world football champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern provinces, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, it is often called an archipelago from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed past the island called it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to transform native grain production methods and employ Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) military forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coast, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the Qing Dynasty government was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), it signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Tower of the Sun, and the Sanctuary of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still going on today.
For example, the most common still image photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still in use today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by the image-type formats of digital cameras.
The 35-mm format actually  and somewhat unusually  measures 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the most basic ratio in integer form) is 3:2.
Many common formats (the ASP family of formats) are identical to or very close to this height/width ratio.
The oft-abused and often-ridiculated rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while providing a benchmark for image editing.
According to him, the most effective place for the main subject is the line that divides the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny as it grew rich and expanded its power.
For more than a millennium, the Christian faith has united European countries despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected kings and common people alike.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are for that very purpose.
The seat of the central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether it really follows that principle.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain instituted a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy of cutting off the most important military and civilian supplies has proven effective, but this blockade has violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain has been mining international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire stretches of ocean, endangering neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York.
When he arrived in the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the manager at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China depicted the different time periods in a particular way; each stage of China or each ruling family was a recognizable dynasty.
There was also an unstable period between the individual dynasties when the provinces were divided, the most famous of which is the Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted 60 years.
During these periods, there were violent battles between many nobles, who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are many, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to one ruler alone.
In addition, the post-revolution professions were open to all male seekers, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This is true in the military, too, because military ranks are now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was intensely interested in things beyond this earthly life, and he visited a cave known as Hira on Mount Nur to meditate.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if we know it exists, and the interior of the cave offers complete solitude.
Except for the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, nothing else is visible, and from inside the cave, little of this world is seen or heard.
Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza survives today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up' arrow shall be in the form of a V and the 'down' arrow shall be in the form of a clasp or a square without a lower edge.
Up means you should start at the top of the bow and push it, down means you should start at the frog (that is, where you hold the bow in your hand) and pull the bow.
The bowstroke from above usually produces a softer sound, while the bowstroke from below is stronger and more decisive.
If you wish, you can draw your own arcs with a pencil, but remember that the printed arcs are for the music and should be taken into account.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced by an angry mob of Frenchmen to retreat from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They were returning to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people alone.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the costs and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the debilitating profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic income for US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which the order was created.
The period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, which marks the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological endeavor or technological need to the idea that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their application in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the same general idea: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently produces "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we might say that as the automobile developed, so, surely, would the road.
However, the national road network cannot be economically justified for only a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increased incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical techniques for the care of injured bodies.
Cultural determinism, which he drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was an important element of Romanticism.
In the case of romance, individuals were shaped by geographical affiliation, and over time, customs and culture associated with a particular geographical area emerged that were in harmony with the state of society and thus superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury was established about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined somewhat in the 12th century, as the crusaders returned home with gifts in the form of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market could offer.
At this time, the fashion capital's title moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At first, dress in the East was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture.
But because of slow communication links, the styles in the West may have been 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great advances of that time, and the result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is the term used for agriculture with the aim of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple, often ecological system using saved seeds from the same ecological region, combined with rotation or another simple technique to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel they have been ignored by social norms and allow them to develop their own identities.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their affiliation through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the ways that is most often used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their childhood due to neglect, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse.
Some wolf children have been confined by humans (usually their parents); this form of child abuse has in some cases been the result of the parents' rejection of the child's more severe mental or physical impairment.
Before being abandoned or fleeing, wild children may have been subjected to severe abuse or trauma in childhood.
Others were said to have raised animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When wild children are fully reared by nonhuman animals, their behavior (within physical limits) is almost exactly the same as that of the animal-carers, for example fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, learning goes one step further.
The learning process is not a learning method but rather a supporting tool for individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The stages can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is the form of the stage, but this is also true for a little link in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stages are an internal part of the software and are intended to ask questions, encourage and explain processes that might be too challenging for the learner alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, loving, and nurturing, yet this is happening.
We think the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The slaughterhouse was supposed to provide all the necessities of life that were not available in the home from which they had been taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent characteristics of the Internet allow for new dimensions in terms of use and access to reward.
For example, learning and socialization are thought to be important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as a new aspect of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they studied how audiences respond to websites.
Video recording has made important discoveries in the interpretation of micropotes, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, they say that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it should be possible to detect whether a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks explained that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, have such a capacity to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century shows that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination with each generation redistributes variation back and forth between the two sets.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, with plant resources available in the savannah, has a hard time meeting its amino acid needs.
Moreover, failure to satisfy this need has serious consequences - stunting, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, which are difficult for primates, including us, to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ant, termite, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also a source of high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way somewhat similar to the way chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is a process in which you deliberately wake up at your normal sleep time and fall back asleep shortly afterwards (after 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will put you to sleep but not wake you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock while sleeping, you can set it on the other side of the room and thus force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces the person to get up and go for a swim.
The amount of inner peace an individual has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in an individual's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force is present, and every human being has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, and the only thing that's standing in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism, while based on the teachings of the Buddha, also draws on the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, and it's made up of yoga, kundalini, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga, with its yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations, is a way to awaken the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment).
The central Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, where the visualization of various deities cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Because Germany was a common enemy during World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States began to cooperate. After the war, systemic, procedural and cultural differences led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, but they fought for real, with the help of proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and redeploy to the Romanian bridge.
These plans became obsolete practically overnight when 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established a Belarusian and Ukrainian front after occupying the eastern Polish regions, in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using a ship to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional task of the Marines was to ensure that the state maintained the ability to move people and goods while limiting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent examples of this, and one of the most noteworthy, was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to bring men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy wanted to stop this kind of traffic, especially with U-boats.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in taking Britain, as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly herded in herds that roamed the hills or other pasturelands, and were often tended by goat herders, often children or teenagers, similar to the more famous sheep herders.
In England, railways were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted of only parallel planks, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat inferior roads of the time.
Soon enough, they began using sills to keep the rails in place, but they gradually found that the rails were more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but iron made the wooden wheels on the wagons wear out faster.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transportation, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (or upright man).
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Two-legged walking features are present in fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but the hominid Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can make our lives more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we must go to the root of the problem and correct it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, but problems have also increased because of overpopulation and man's wasteful lifestyle.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, known as "Dunlap's Flyers".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read by him to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
Twenty-five Dunlap tracts still exist, and they are considered the oldest surviving copies of this document, since the handwritten original has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet, birds and dinosaurs share many similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all the computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, these two numbers are called binary digits  or bits, if we use computer jargon.
Internal intoxication is not always the most obvious, but symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to be difficult to diagnose immediately.
The main indication of internal poisoning is the possible presence of an open package of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see if the specific first aid instructions are given for this particular toxin.
Entomologists officially use the term "insect" for this group of insects.
This term comes from a prehistoric relationship with the mites, highly evolved human parasites.
Both the larvae and the moths are nesting animals that are adapted to life in the nest or the home of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease of young adults and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that caring for a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take on the role of the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method, and that method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
But that's not all, because an important part of scientific research is testing, where testing is a test that is designed to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and observing.
Naturalists and philosophers have devoted themselves to the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most of the observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often essentially dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation by means of biological clocks.
Repetitive rhythms, which are not just responses to periodic external stimuli, have been recorded in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue periods of continuous cyclic repetition even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main clues that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into the bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments where they labeled DNA in a phosphorus flask or a sulfur protein flask.
The effects of mutations can vary widely depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether germ cells are affected.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to learn about the beauty of the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, we can observe, photograph, and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in their cars to go to work, and those who work in the area they have just left drive by.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the passenger-car transportation system.
Science now shows that a massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
In society, everyone participates and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they fail every day, is it because of the incompetence of transportation engineers, or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour is usually fixed to some extent, so traffic flows are fixed and can be roughly represented in mathematical form.
To better illustrate the traffic flow, the ratios between the three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
The insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made them more adept at avoiding enemies and finding food and mating partners.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings along their body.
This gives them even more opportunities to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings to their bodies are the serpentine herders and the one-dayers.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise, that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, since we don't have the sense that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon, with a width of up to six miles, is also the widest river on earth.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the Giza pyramids and the technical expertise of their construction were never surpassed.
During the New Kingdom, Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
In the Vatican, legislation and official communication are in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the country's workers, while Latin is often used in religious services.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of them can be found in their original form in nature and can be mined quite easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
In fact, there were more than four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he claimed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that they could be put into the dot at the end of this sentence to make a trillion.
Thus, the pencil was a dear friend to many when it was invented.
Unfortunately, new writing methods were developed, and the pencil was pushed to the side.
People are now typing messages on computer screens and not even going near the spike.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
The way a fission bomb works is that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart into a slaughterhouse, and then some of that energy is released by re-injection of the core.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they usually decay on their own or with little help.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the sea, thicker under the highlands.
There could be more seas on the near side, because the crust is thinner, and the lava could rise to the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on finding what drives people forward or what pleases them.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize during adulthood.
These theories explore what it is that makes some people want the things they want, and what things in the environment will prepare them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivation theory.
When managers start managing their former colleagues, it is generally considered that they can start behaving in one of two ways: on the one hand, there is the desire to remain one of the boys (or girls).
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating the performance of workers, assigning tasks and taking responsibility for mistakes made.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done and chart a course of his own.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the group.
Such behavior often creates a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups strive for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, but there are small differences.
Virtual group members often act as a contact point for their direct physical group.
They tend to have more freedom than the ordinary members of the group, as their groups have to adapt to several time zones, which their local leadership sometimes does not listen to.
Another characteristic component of a virtual group is the presence of a real 'invisible group' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
The 'invisible team' is the management team, to which the individual members report.
Why would an organisation undergo the delayed process of setting up a learning organisation?
When the functional departments of the organisation make efficient use of the available resources, creativity and ingenuity can be triggered.
This can result in a new innovative process within the organisation's collaborative process to overcome barriers, which will meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can become innovative, management must establish an innovation environment and promote shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the field of research and dramatically increasing its accuracy.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the theses in the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
And this gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand how processes go on in our heads.
Although AI has a strong science fiction feel, it constitutes a very important branch of computing that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate industries focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it is embedded in many software for personal computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of any class, and teachers would often be happy to take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution by offering virtual excursions, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire art in the classroom.
Posting a trip report online is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital, redesign the website every year, but the old versions remain online and serve as a souvenir album.
Although most students start writing an online diary with superficial grammar and spelling, this is usually changed by the presence of an audience.
Since students can often be the most demanding audience, the blogger starts working on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to engage the public inspires students to want to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The online diary is a tool to encourage cooperation and the desire of pupils to learn, even when they are not in school.
The appropriate use of online journals "can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; by constantly responding to online material, students can establish their own position in relation to the writings of others and shape their view on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it boasts numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
A little further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of Muskoka and the backwaters.
All of this and more puts Ontario in the spotlight as something that foreigners consider to be typically Canadian.
The vast areas farther north are quite sparsely populated, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The population comparison may surprise many: There are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent in terms of its fauna and flora.
The smaller islands are mostly independent states or linked to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the area, which became strongly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The beginnings of European influence and colonization date back to the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India around Africa.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: We recommend that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks valuable.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can give the impression of harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, to be grabbed by the hand, and so on.
Be firm in your rejection of men and do not be afraid to defend your position (this is not acceptable, regardless of cultural differences).
Modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids under the name Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese as Casa Branca, and then abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The city was rebuilt as Daru l-Badya by the Moroccan sultan, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who set up trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is not difficult to find places selling traditional Moroccan delicacies such as tagine, pottery and leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of geegaws, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is safe enough, trips outside Goma need to be explored to understand the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
It is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the best mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can travel around Goma by bo-bo-do (motor taxi), which will cost about 500 Congolese francs (CFA) for a short ride at the usual (local) rate.
Because it is also quite difficult to access, "Timbuktu" is used as another name for exotic, distant lands.
Although its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport have made it a popular destination, Timbuktu is now a deprived city.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the danger of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS special of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World".
This city is very different from the rest of the country, because it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different group of wild fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's biggest attractions and is considered the showpiece of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
A daily fee is required for nature conservation and park visits, as in any South African national park.
It might be a bad idea to buy a Wild Card, which grants access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and is the main stop for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong are associated with a shimmering colonnade chart, highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast, Kowloon.
Urban development in the Hong Kong islands is largely concentrated in the re-consolidated territory along the northern coast.
This city was taken over by the British colonialists as their own, so it's a good starting point to see the remnants of the area's colonial past, if that's what you're interested in.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last surviving remnants of the mighty jungles that once overgrown the Ganges Basin.
The Sundarbans covers a large area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/wetland areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 tigers in the area.
Buses run from the inter-city bus station (across the river) all day, with most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, running from 6.30 a.m. to 7.30 a.m.
Since long-distance buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most counties offer small Japanese minibuses that are comfortable and sturdy.
By sharing taxis, you can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby towns such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with the town of Saint Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The towers are 273 feet [83 m] high, 1,292 feet [378 m] long, and have two 12 feet [3.5 m] wide passageways.
The bridge is 50 feet (15 m) high and was built in August 2011 but opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are also expected to be completed.
The GuaranÃ­, who lived as nomadic hunters and engaged in subsistence agriculture, were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the territory of present-day eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous tribal groups, such as the GuaycurÃº and the PayaguÃ¡, lived in the Chaco, subsisting on hunting, logging, and fishing.
Paraguay, sometimes called the "Great Indian Province", developed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native peoples.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its own character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Las CaÃ±itas Polo Grounds.
You can watch minor tournaments and matches all year round.
Tournament news and information on purchasing tickets for the polo match can be found at the AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) and its value is set at the equivalent of the British Pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted on virtually all islands, and Stanley is mostly open to credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Outside islands are unlikely to accept credit cards, but they may accept British and American currency; ask the owners in advance what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your cash before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical belt, with summer temperatures often exceeding 30 Â°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it appear colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to human presence, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park's instructions, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
Buffalo, Canadian deer, elk, bear, and moose - all large animals can be aggressive, no matter how tame they appear.
Every year, dozens of visitors are harmed because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them alone.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval skirmish in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city ended with the assassination of Tupue Chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland has two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located along the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are mostly sandy and safe for swimming and are usually planted with New Zealand Christmas trees pohutukawa, which provide shade.
The Tamaki Drive waterfront is located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a good selection of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not complex but pleasant and refreshing beer.
You can afford a variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines will probably make the trip easier.
The tap water there is safe to drink, but it is not difficult to find bottled water if you are afraid.
Australians perceive "coffee with milk" as something foreign: a short black coffee is an "espresso", cappuccino is made with a generous amount of cream (not foamed milk), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're excellent.
The reef is visited by many hikers throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, obey the instructions of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Sea otters come to the beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans, and most shark are afraid of humans and swim away.
Although sea crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their original habitat is in the mouths of rivers north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, a traveler ensures that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his chosen destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport and even combined air and hotel packages.
They may also withhold your reservation if you need to reconsider the offer or obtain additional documents for your final destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any adjustments and requests should be communicated first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be a key part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
While the music may be quieter on the main stages, it should be noted that in some festival venues, the music may play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the sound of breaking through the ice is quite frightening for the most sensitive.
Cruises from St Petersburg include a stop in the city.
Gambling establishments usually do their best to keep their guests occupied as much as possible, and the windows and clocks are usually gone, and the exits are hard to find.
Their offerings usually include food, drink, and entertainment points to keep visitors entertained and in their homes for as long as possible.
At some locations, alcoholic beverages are included in the price, and alcoholism affects judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-glacial temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the grip is poor and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to make you trapped.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or wind-borne snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is largely free all year round.
Safari is perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in everyday usage refers to a journey by land where we see African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are often seen close to cars and can be seen well with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you will be able to see them more easily with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "jungle walk", "hiking safari", or "hiking") is a type of hike that can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between 24 August and 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the reschedule, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but most coronavirus cancellation rules from late March do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled to take place.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, and regular tickets will cost about 7,000 yen.
Licking wet clothes dries them faster, and many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they're not already in the room.
If you do not have an iron on hand or do not want to wear socks that are ironed, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the product (which can shrink or even deform it).
There are several ways of purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it must be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you have doubts, buy bottled water from a trusted company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause hypersensitivity or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, emit toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers who go to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most demanding on the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, often crossing isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rough roads, be careful, as steep, narrow roads and sharp bends are common.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than in the earlier and later sections, usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than usual.
And surprisingly, the cell signal here is much stronger than on many other sections of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, but in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, since cooked apples are found in the cakes all year round, and cherries and plums are a popular choice in the summer.
Most German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes usually go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a pastry that is small but rich, try something called, depending on the region, a Berlin doughnut, a pancake, or a doughnut.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal provinces of that subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is a general term for a wide variety of local dishes found throughout the country, which offers as many as 17,000 islands.
However, the term without additional identifiers mostly refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by a type of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors that Javanese people love being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The spikes support the rider's feet and hang on either side of the saddle.

Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good weather you will be able to cover more distance than by walking  but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and well-groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean applying for a visa several times and avoiding passport checks.

Due to the underwater topology, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper sections and a rapid downward flow can be formed there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue while swimming backwards, which can be impossible.
Once you've managed to escape the current, swimming back will be no different than normal.
