This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as their colors and three-dimensional layouts.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides a first glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed structure, called a rachis, but instead have other feather traits  barbs and beards  the researchers deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other traits.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for temperature regulation or visualization. The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the scapula shows adult plumage rather than a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the scapula shows adult plumage and no chick feathers.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey early on Monday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office stated that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant of responsibility for the attack.
They found that the Sun functioned according to the same basic principles as the other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was conditioned by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the magnetic inversions.

The work done was essentially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a similar force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
During an interview, he stated that the new variant was "beyond worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have picked up the virus at the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two of them were health workers at the hospital.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people who have TB still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate they have chosen in an envelope.
After verification by officials of the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voters list.
French electoral law codifies rather strict procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelope was present at the start of voting and that no envelope was added without those of the duly numbered and authorized electors.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Four female skiers failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated, "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are designated under the names of Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car struck it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
She is detained pending her indictment and trial, but any evidence of eyewitness testimony can be vitiated by the fact that her image has been widely published.
It is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but Scottish justice operates differently and courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks "journalists really seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos etc of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally concerned with actions in justice, has advised the press that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the newspaper, will address the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on those before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that would be discussed included the future status of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years unless an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for no more than five years.
The shooters of the supplementary test of control of the nesting populations had to be closely monitored by the guards, as long as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the interim director of conservation and heritage for the park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received full safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures that will lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread demonstrations opposed to the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some due as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating from malfunctioning iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Bureau stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, have now been released, as have the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the Commons. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would accelerate the fetal lung of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first nanny. Luna has transcended the night of the two moons. She is truly unique just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Moon was as troubled as I am...maybe more...I love him and will miss him...hope he is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard has recalled during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 per cent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent of them believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100 and 200 metre freestyle and triple jump categories at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his flat feet, his fitness has been called into question.
He was unable to take the medications necessary to overcome his pain as they were forbidden by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using computer hardware and software since early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of the water supply to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political blah blah and stupidity".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of an aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and surface trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and relay parking facilities are unavailable on the ground.
Fears of a shortage of transportation raised the possibility that he would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the equatorial islands of the Galapagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take longer, due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the finch of the immigrant cacti, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked to make all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled up into very small shapes.
It can be pulled to become a fine thread, which can be twisted and pulled. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and embedded in another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red kidney juice.
The juice of beets changes color depending on the degree of acidity or base (alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical product being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their protons removed from them (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Keep both dry powders together and then, with clean and moist hands, knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give you a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water-powered communities in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated roof system.
Remains of roof systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also communes in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the communes were sometimes a part of public bath houses where men and women were together in mixed company.
If you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to lift a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster means of transportation.
We have taken the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including some stray domestic cats) that eat the most numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the caplet, a special job that each cat has and which prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of the felines, living in large, tightly knit groups.
Lion herds are composed of one to three adult males of the same family, together with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act as packs of wolves or cubs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other felines) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times the force of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar, but more like a phrase of words that have been reared and uttered.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, and may, or will, eat monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by their scent, narrating where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very furtively. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and rivals, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new surroundings, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants obtain their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most important predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra ridge in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that he was at one time a cannibal.
It also attacked anything in the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have been able to fight it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebration elements, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a missara.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they were spread out on their sides while eating their meals.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have bought food that would have arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a dish.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered to be the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open shelves facing the street; stone was used to build houses.
There were no major forests in the land of Canaan, and the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. It is told in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, when he traveled further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But beyond its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you may have noticed that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. And even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, on the reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, this large document and parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings, and subsequent battles, had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French from "Vichy", who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was dubbed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American forces and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people living and working cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, a cognate of the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defined the social dimension of society in some way.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the passing of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural weight, and an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government with Congress as its only constituent under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and, since it had no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states took over the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice skating and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the island group that Japan has, Japan is often called, from a geographical point of view, an "archipelago"
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the coastal regions of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of still image photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image capture formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat surprisingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is wildly abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while preserving a measure of order in an image.
He states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had bound the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the villain.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade had violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing further danger to neutral shipping.
While there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his employer in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing the different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between each dynasty, with provinces being divided, the most notable of which was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war raged between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, as thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates allowing the most ambitious and brilliant to succeed.
The same is true for the military because instead of having army ranks based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to attend a ball that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (the light) for contemplation.
The poem itself, which has survived to the present day, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find and even if one knew it existed, once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear, beautiful round sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Not much of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khofo and many of the pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built to honor Khofo's wives and family members.
The "high arrow" mark looks like a V and the "low arrow mark" looks like a graph or a square that lacks a background.
Up means you should start at the point and shoot the bow, and down means you should start at the top (which is where your hand holds the bow) and shoot the bow.
A high bow usually generates a softer sound, while a low bow is louder and more assertive.
You should feel free to make your own mark with a fretboard, but remember that printed marks are here for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were driven back from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a horde of people who shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the sides of their chariot completely open.
At one point a member of the public waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in the face of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were required to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay back a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Certainly, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological imperative or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a network of national roads is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, and so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new sleeping techniques to repair bodily injuries.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was perceived as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic architecture reached its peak during the period from the 10th to the 14th century.
Early clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, styles in the west could resonate back 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of this period was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is conducted by producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological system using stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically many peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which may include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequently used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from some of the most unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growing up years.
Such children are called "wild" or "savage".[citation needed] Some wild children have been confined by people (usually the parents themselves); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children had suffered violence or severe trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are thought to have been abducted by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When completely subjugated by nonhuman animals, the feral child manifests behaviors (within its physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular animal adopting the animal, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to be the easiest and most interesting learning, the point is to go one step further.
Empont is not a learning method but rather a tool that provides support to individuals experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stages can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a stage form but this is also the case with the trombone man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Points are internalized in software and are designed to question, prompt, and explain processes that may have been too complex for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring nursing staff, stable education and reliable health care.
Host families are supposed to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continued relationships were also identified as novel aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting their microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, showed how people who were unable to understand speech due to brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately estimate sincerity.
It also suggests that some of the same interpretative abilities of human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two sources of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reservoir of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination combine to produce variation in both directions between both reservoirs in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet their needs for amino acids from the resources available in plants.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the accessible proteins in leaves and vegetables, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, chick, egg) are not only easily digestible, but provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively discreet alarm clock to guide you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm during your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is in direct correlation with the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the blood pressure, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were spread by the Mahayana path of love and by the technical forces of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is basically very simple, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. Since the end of the war, the confrontation of systems, processes and culture has led to a break between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and its goods, while interfering with the ability of its enemy to move its people and its goods.
One of the most cited recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used U-boats, was trying to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, furs, meat, and fur.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the generally better known shepherds. These pastoral methods are still employed today.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails of the hypomobil railways consisted simply of parallel wooden posts, they allowed the horse-drawn rails to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
The crossbars were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place; however, it was later realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron band over them.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known means of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as they usually do.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living more respectfully for the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
It is not just a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we want only a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should disable them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the problems have become bigger because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap sheets".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One of these was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July, and a copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 leaves of Dunlap that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that go back to the dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of an internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic chemicals in the home.
You should check the label for the specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with the chimpanzees, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
The female and the male killer whale are both nest-dwellers, adapted to live in a nest or the dwelling of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the dominant neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to abort a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only way, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external signals, have been documented by most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of cycling in a free-flowing manner even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by marking either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of taking advantage of the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Most people complain about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or the bridges that they have.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they not function properly on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
For example, conductors tend to behave in a reasonably consistent way; whereas, circulation currents tend to have some consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small holes to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and aphids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This seems odd, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the first largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at some six kilometres (3.7 mi) wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were admiring the monuments of their predecessors, which were much older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life for most of those working in the state while Latin is often employed in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it was also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You have to keep in mind that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
And so, the hedgehog was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the greedon was relegated to a lesser status and jobs.
People now write messages on computers or computer screens, without ever having to deal with a scribbler.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to knock together a nucleus and many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Fracturing the nucleus again releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to separate with a small push or even less.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the opposite side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker in the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people choose or what is of interest to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by the time they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what is it about certain people that makes them envy the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when directors begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to stay "one of the guys" (or women).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, exercising disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and take ownership of it.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members since their teams may meet in function of variable time zones that may not be covered by their local administration.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and both shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, thus limiting the scope of research and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to the real problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been built into various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. Often a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual excursions, where students can pick up artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also an excellent way to plan an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is remodeled, but older versions are kept online for use as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with a poor grasp of grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make a real effort to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
At the same time blogging "obliges students to become more aware of the world around them".[32] The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of other writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant bilingual capital and features a good array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is much further south and the north is the region of natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more have put Ontario on a highlight list in what is considered to be the quintessential Canadian for outsiders.
The larger expanses further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness regions.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent alone in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, and it became firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began during the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape of Europe route to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what may be considered harassment and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You have to be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend the territory (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meronids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajinas, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of dacoits, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the far east coast of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma must be studied to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo together with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracks in Africa.
A boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) can be used to make the tour of Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbocto" has come to be employed as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a small town, although its reputation as a tourist attraction has made it an important port and airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages during the special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 (11,500 sq mi) and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the hallmark of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, a daily maintenance fee and an entrance fee are payable for the park.
It can also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either selections of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be of prime interest.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart that is made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head towards the Kowloon seafront in the distance.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the area that the British colonists took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest inside the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps but also include some of the last remaining patches of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer roaming the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres (269 ft), are 378 metres (1,212 ft) long and have two 3.50 m (11.9 ft) wide towers.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurus and Payaguas, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
During the 16th century Paraguay, which was formerly called "the giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in the entire world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP) which is equivalent in value to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and inside Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, and even if British and American currency can be taken; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropical regions; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the fauna is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, you should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, elk, oryx, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking unhealthy food and keep a clean field.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the death of the Tupua supreme leader Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland is sandwiched between two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch to Long Bay in the north and Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shady spots provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are family beaches sometimes very busy with a good range of shops lined up on the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to choose from, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia could travel better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an espresso, cappuccino comes fully laced with cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to schools are made throughout the year, and accidents due to these causes on schools are rare.
However, you should take the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear on beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Lemurs do exist in the wild, but they rarely attack humans. Most lemurs are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, and it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or even some packages that combine flights with hotel accommodation.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the proposal or to get you other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be notified through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you will have to get up early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping routes for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes a terrible noise for the most affected people.
Cruise ships in Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special food and drink and entertainment proposals, to keep customers in good spirits, and to keep them on their toes.
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages on the premises. However, intoxication impairs judgment and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Those who are able to drive at high latitudes or on mountain slopes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to immobilize you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow falling or being carried by the wind, by condensation or by ice on the vehicle's windshields.
On the other hand, conditions under ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic runs almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are the strong point for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips by land to observe the magnificent African wildlife, particularly the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move close to cars and standard equipment will allow them to be observed closely.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen with twins.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, a safari excursion, or a "footing") consists of walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the report's announcement, you may have a problem.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies do not expire until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the competitions will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Cleaning wet clothes can help them dry. Most hotels have a washing machine and a laundry available for borrowing, even if there are no gifts in the room.
If a sanding iron is not available or you are not keen on carrying sanded pipes, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Care should be taken not to allow the tissue to become too hot (which can cause weakening, or in extreme cases, burning of the skin).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are required.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you do, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter strange beasts that they are not familiar with in their regions of origin.
Snuffed animals can waste food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people forcibly, do not fall into the category of noxious causes.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods free of duty and special taxes in certain areas.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated patches of pine forest.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a calm mind: steep ski slopes, narrow lanes and tight turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections  frequently 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other portions of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cuisine is very good, and in Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit in the pastry is frequent, with apples cooked in cakes all year round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German products cooked in the oven also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes harmonize particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the one that, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on aromatic herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian gastronomy is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found across the nation.
However, when used without any other qualifier, the term tends to mean the food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a variety of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors favored by Javanese are cocoa beans, peppers, sugar (particularly coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can create safety concerns because of the potential for the rider's feet to get caught.
If a rider has escaped from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be shot if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a soft, fairly narrow heel and sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks include impressive views from the peaks. Climbers from all parts of the world continually establish new routes between its infinite potential walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating on snow-covered ground with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many enthusiasts, known occasionally as "ski vagabonds", who plan entire ski-centric vacations in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and, in 1861, the first leisure ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called skiing backpacking, skiing walking or skiing excursion.
It is related to but usually does not include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires more rigid skis and boots.
You have to think of the skiing route as a similar excursion route.
In good conditions you can cover relatively greater distances than walking but you will very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy bag on damaged tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls many times.
The Schengen area, however, functions to some extent as a country in this case.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without passing through passport control points again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, and you save time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition is subject to geographical variations, as the age limit may be lower in some places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products may be defined as antique, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income for the Sami and the culture surrounding trade is important to many of their other professions.
More traditionally, not all Sami have participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer primarily as shooting animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami country.
Although commonly used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advice, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments that are not your own, but whose advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advice is simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is the generic term for any type of weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Inclement weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many different forms, which can vary depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and effects of inclement weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea storms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal violent weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of all the risks of severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect all their travel plans.
Those planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should follow professional training.
An Internet search for 'course to hostile environment' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course should normally address all of the topics discussed here in much greater detail, usually with some practical experience.
A course will normally last between 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, many elements of first-person shoot and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness regions are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they carry valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender indication (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is simply variable everywhere.
Breaches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to pass through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Starting currents are the backflow of waves that rise from the beach, often at or near a shore.
Because of the submarine topology the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current to the deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim to shore against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, getting back in is no more difficult than it normally is.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be trapped again or, depending on your abilities and if you have been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
Back-to-back shocks occur more quickly than culture shock (and are less severe than a honeymoon phase), last longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to their new culture sometimes have particularly difficult times adjusting back to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show is one of the area's most interesting things for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sound of tourists and vendors for a long time. The history of sounds and lights is simply like a book of stories.
The Sphinx serves as both a backdrop and narrator to a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and hold the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km (75 mi) north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which culminates at 4,892 m (19,029 ft) above sea level on Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel to learn.
It is particularly popular for school leavers, as it allows them to take a gap year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling for a gap year in studies abroad can actually improve your chances of entering higher education when you return to your home country.
There will generally be tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands as well, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagoes and larger lakes are effectively large enough for any type of yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This coincides with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic Cruises include a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and then go back to sleeping on the boat at night.
If you go ashore only as part of the ship's excursions you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise lines feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and all conditions, particularly if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different than the personal fears and aversions of other things that most people have.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not being able to control anything.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Frequently, time is of the essence for business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an emergency repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If goods were sent by air freight, on some itineraries, it may have taken days to get through the unloading stages and customs.
The only way to make it through faster was to send it as baggage in the trunk. Airline regulations will not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, which is where it comes in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to spend a fair amount of money for that privilege (or, even better, to have your company do it for you).
However, it is not a good bargain: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to at least four times the normal economy class price for business class and eleven times the normal price for first class!
In general, there is no point in seeking reductions for business class or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and are billed accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
Formerly the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy center of commercial operations, set around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century bazaar and the old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting sculptures of marble doves on some of the tombs.
It's worth a half-hour's walk to this strange village.
To the north and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra which was made famous by foreigners after a lengthy account of its splendors was documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you should also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), a place of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting primarily a site of mass graves and also a site that has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or who worked there to their deaths, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make any jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not degrade the site by writing or graffitiing on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and virtually all speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made solely in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although it is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get laid in Paris is still to show your best behavior, by acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-educated). This will make getting laid considerably easier.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians will quickly evaporate if you practice some basic courtesies.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and features a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying levels of altitude.
The valley also harbors an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna can be found there such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, badger, lynx, iron cat and wild peacock, as well as many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are asked to wear gowns that cover the knees and to have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide women with shawls that are not made up, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same fashion, men were required to wear trousers that covered their knees.
This can also be taken from the reservation at the entrance but this dress is not washed after each use and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these gowns. One size fits all!
The Malhorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (usually pork), and uses olive oil from everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is bread with oil: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any kind of available accompaniment such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, together with the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, and usually in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It certainly makes reading easier, and even if writing is a bit complicated by the need to discover if a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to be considered are c and g, although their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure you pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means car, while carro means car.
They lose it to a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that it does not need to be studied separately.
Early modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not the type of problem that it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built during the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor only for him and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, so you should resist the temptation to take just "one" specimen.
If you visit a formal landscaped garden, picking up a few "specimens" will also get you banned, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to go and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything you want as soon as you get there.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you will have to manage both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
You have to check that the bus you are thinking of taking goes to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good base for a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Leire Valley, the Rhine Valley or going on a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or taking a boat on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holidays have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at some exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Most traditional churches often celebrate an Easter vigil on the Saturday night of Easter Sunday, with some congregations often beginning the celebration as early as midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands arrived either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance to the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less constantly.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to take advantage of the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The costumes are standard work clothes and colleagues are called by their surnames or by their job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with an emphasis on group effort rather than individual performance.
Workers are often required to obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without question.
