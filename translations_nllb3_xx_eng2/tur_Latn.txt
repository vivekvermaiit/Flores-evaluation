Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a theory that already exists, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is pale or carotenoid at the bottom of the body and chestnut-brown at the top.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed stalk called a bird's feather stalk but had other feather features, such as claws and talons, the researchers concluded that the bird's feather stalk was probably an evolutionary development that came later than these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight purposes, but rather for temperature regulation and imaging purposes. The researchers say that although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers rather than juvenile ones.
Although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers claim that it is not the feathers of a chick, for example, but those of an adult.
A car bomb exploded in the police headquarters in the Turkish city of Gaziantep yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be due to tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that much of the dark matter found around a galaxy is found in a similar form to the ring of light around the galaxy and is composed of many small-sized particles.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters sit alone in a booth, putting a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that shows the candidate they have chosen.
Once the authorities confirm the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the box and signs the voter list.
French election law regulates the process quite strictly.
Ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988, so that voters and observers can confirm that there were no envelopes in the ballot boxes at the beginning of voting, and that no envelopes were added to the boxes except those that were thrown by voters who were deemed to be properly and approved.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every stage of the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close observation, following certain procedures.

Chief Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had gone to court with his face covered.
There were three people in the house when the car hit, but none of them were hurt.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road was temporarily closed as emergency responders removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, who was charged with murdering his son, has since been held in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
He is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but the publicity of the photo could jeopardize the credibility of the evidence presented by the witnesses.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has found the publication of the photographs potentially objectionable in different cases and courts.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University says: "Journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Crown Office, which is fully responsible for the prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is prepared.
The leaked document allegedly mentions the border dispute in which Palestine demands a return to the borders that existed before the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
Other issues covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that troops be stationed in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while Palestine agrees to limit this requirement to only five years.
The hunters participating in the complementary insect spraying trial were scheduled to be closely monitored by guards while the trial was observed and efficiency assessed.
The NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. have teamed up with qualified volunteers to join the team as part of the Sporting Hunting Association's hunting program.
According to Deputy Director of Park Conservation Mick O'Flynn and NPWS Heritage, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have received extensive safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This will be Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to force the country into new elections.
Martelly responded with this commission to the high-profile anti-regime demonstrations that began in October.
The failure to hold the necessary elections has set the stage for sometimes violent protests, some of which have been pending since 2011.
There were about 60 reported cases of iPod overheating, causing six fires in total and minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 new extreme heat events, and that the company had classified them as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "really sad".
The quake struck at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday) in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there were no reported injuries in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has kidnapped buses in the Philippine capital of Manila and taken Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
At least six people have been confirmed dead so far in the rescue of numerous hostages.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released along with the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers replaced an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained in obstetrics and gynaecology and began her residency at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna, died one night when she was two months old, just like her, quite unique, powerful woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even more so... and I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that opposition to Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that Australia should have a republican treasonous at the end of the term of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the extreme points of the vote, 31 percent believe Australia should never be a republic, while 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should be a republic as soon as possible.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple-flag at the Commonwealth Games, but her fitness is in doubt due to her complaints.
He couldn't get the medicine he needed to ease his pain because they were banned from the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever on January 25.
In early February, many people using different hardware and software confirmed this discovery, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could be the source of water, which could make proteins and bring organic matter to Earth, which could support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, formed from comets colliding with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and stupidity".
There's been speculation that he'll be a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately detect aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No extra service, no overground trains at Wembley, no surface parking and no facilities for the thousands.
The match was likely to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans, as there was fear of a lack of transport.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's spider, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus spider, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, rolled into small shapes.
It can be made into thin wires that can be twisted and bent, beaten or extruded to form a plate.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "tezhip".
It's called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of Hydrogen (H) ions in the test chemical (pH in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have their electrons stripped away from them, because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron.
Mix two tablespoons of dry powder, then shape it into a ball with your clean, wet hands.
It's going to give you a fun feeling as the moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layers and forms a kind of shell on your hand.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
In Greece, the ruins of a sewage system were found in houses in the cities of Minos on the island of Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Iran, and China had toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of baths, where men and women were mixed in a mixed company.
When you're looking for someone who lives thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite as a vehicle.
The satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite is launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere blocks some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it has done for us is make it much easier and faster to get around.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
At the bottom of these are more moderate-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domesticated cats that have been released) that eat many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
Lion herds consist of about thirty adult related males ranging from one to three, along with females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other and are part of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave very similarly to wolf or dog herds, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (Genus Panthera), and these four are the only cat species that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not the full-voiced roar of a lion, but it is much more like a rattling, shouting sentence.
The ocelots love to eat small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find other animals for food by sensing where they are on the ground, by smelling.
With their night vision, they can see very well at night and they can also be extremely stealthy, as the oseloes integrate into their prey's environment and capture them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the population from which they came (for example, if they go behind a ridge or river, or if they go to a new island where it will not be easy for them to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than they previously needed.
The original population has not changed, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to look more and more different from the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two animals will seem too different to be the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but maybe it had a forked tongue, and it ate turtles, big fish and other mosasaurs, and maybe it ate its own kind.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex.
While we are familiar with much of their food, the Romans received their share of strange or unusual banqueting items, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called the nut mouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women liked to sit in chairs and eat their meals, while the rich men liked to sit side by side and eat their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and they had never tasted any ancient Roman turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each god, which was considered the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which can only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special temple for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden, shops were open stalls facing the street, and stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan lacked large forests, so the price of wood was exorbitant.
Greenland is sparsely settled, and Norse legends tell of Erik the Red being banished from Iceland for murder, and of finding Greenland and naming it Greenland while travelling west.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, and although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large scroll (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for the purpose of concealment.
So it's likely that the information is simply added as a label.
The Normandy Expedition and subsequent wars liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the name "Operation Dragoon" being used for the invasion.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and moved on to Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a substantially large group of people, a community, who live and work together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning 'civil', and is related to the Latin civis, meaning 'citizen', and the Latin civitas, meaning 'city' or 'city-state', and also describes the size of a society.
City states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture refers to the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and an equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence of themselves and are not considered true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen colonies established a weak central government, the first under the Confederate Constitution, and Congress was the only component of that government.
Congress had no taxing power, and with no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on often uncooperative state officials to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the power to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The amendments required the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states so underestimated the central government that their representatives were often not in office.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Football, basketball, volleyball, softball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing are among the popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have about 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making Japan the seventh largest island on earth!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to geographically as a "team".
Taiwan's turning point dates back to a period in the 15th century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a plant in southwestern Taiwan, which brought about a change in the local grain production methods and employed Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Macchu Picchu consists of three main structures known as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the facility have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration is still going on today.
For example, the most common form of still image photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, it gets its en-boy ratio from digital camera image sensor formats.
It's a bit confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to find the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this en-boy ratio.
The overused and often-ignored rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamism in a photograph while maintaining scale.
It indicates that the most effective area for the main subject is the point of convergence of the lines that divide the image into three, longitudinally and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was controlled.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had held the nations of Europe together despite their differences in language and traditions.
His all-pervasive power has affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the most important beliefs of Christianity is the use of wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's capital is used specifically for this purpose.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money there led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Immediately after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This siege, although in violation of international law, which has been accepted as general law in many international treaties over the past two centuries, has been strategically effective and has prevented the transport of vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain endangered even neutral shipping by laying mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire ocean.
Since this tactic had a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to the submarine warfare that had been unleashed.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitude of most citizens and the nation was one of pacifism and isolationism.
The nations that had witnessed the horrors and oppression of war in World War I wanted to avoid facing such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company, located in New York City.
He came to the U.S. with four cents, a book of poetry and a letter of reference from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China followed a unique way of showing the different periods of time; each period of China or each ruling family is a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability, with each dynasty having its own division of territory, the most famous of which is the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
During the Three Kingdoms period, one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands died fighting for the highest position in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Again, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, ensuring that the most ambitious and successful would win.
The same is true for the army, because the army ranks are now based on Cailaber, not class.
The French Revolution inspired many members of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this ordinary life, and to immerse himself in thought, he often went to a cave on Mount Nur (Light), later called Hira.
The cave itself, which dates from that time, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if it is known to exist, it is not easy to find, and it is completely isolated inside the cave.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many great pyramids built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the large Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and much of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family heirlooms.
The upper arrow mark is a V-shaped gibbo, and the "lower arrow mark" looks like a staple or a missing square below.
It means that you have to start at the top and push the bow, and then you have to start at the bottom and pull the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and sharper.
Feel free to make your own markings with the pencil, but remember that the printed arrow-pulling markings are there for a musical reason, so you usually have to follow them.
The terrified King Louis XVI, his two young children, 11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles, Queen Marie Antoinette and the King's sister Madame Elizabeth were forcibly deported from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a mob of women.
They returned to Paris in a car, surrounded by a mob of people shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The human race forced the King and Queen to open the car windows.
At one point, someone in the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The war expenses incurred by US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the interest and expenses of the bonds that were held on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Undoubtedly, the extra profit made from the long years of exploitation of the Filipino people is among the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the sect.
The period in which the events occurred is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is the time period of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000-13000 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages around 1500, when the agreement ended.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a very wide range of ideas in practice, including views such as technological drive or the inevitability of technology, which argue that the fate of humans is determined by subconscious scientific laws and a logic associated with the application of these laws in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has some "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car was a necessary precursor to the development of roads.
But having a nationwide road infrastructure is not economically feasible if there are fewer vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to more accidents on the roads, which leads to new techniques in the health sector to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism was characterized by a broad cultural determinism that passed through writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, traditions and culture related to that geography emerged that were more in tune with where the society was located and better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was considered the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
About 400 C.E., it gained a reputation as a center of luxury, a reputation that it maintained until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined in the twelfth century as the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued much more highly than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
The title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris during these years.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries and reached its peak in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and with the end of the Crusades, one of the great advances of the period was the use of buttons to sew clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done solely for the purpose of producing enough food to meet the needs of the person engaged in farming and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system in which protected seeds specific to the ecological zone and crop rotation or other relatively simple methods are used to obtain maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of various factors.
Members of a subculture express their identity as part of that culture by using a distinctive and symbolic style, often involving fashion, attitude, and slang.
One of the most common ways that we use to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to highlight a few unfortunate cases of children who were socialized by adults who neglected them, unwillingly or intentionally abused them while they were growing up.
Some feral children have been confined to enclosed spaces by humans (mostly their own parents), in some cases because the parents rejected the serious mental or physical disability of a child.
Wild children may have been subjected to severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to live alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (as far as physical limitations permit) that are almost entirely those of the animal that raised it, such as fear of humans or insensitivity to humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easy and interesting, mentoring goes one step further.
Orientation support is not a learning method but a support to individuals experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The guidance support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a guide, but so is the little attaché guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in the software and are meant to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that a student might find challenging to tackle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in a place that lacks protection, affection and education, but unfortunately, that's not the case.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these kids.
Our expectations of our foster family system are safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Child Protective Services is obliged to meet all the requirements that were not previously met in the home where they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add additional dimensions in terms of its approach to use and enjoyment.
For example, learning and socialization are recommended as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When investigating audience reactions to websites, personal engagement and perpetuated relationships were also identified as new incentive elements by Eighmey and McCord (1998).
The use of video images has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is suggested that the correct interpretation of microexpressions in particular can be used to determine whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article called The President's Speech, noted that people who have trouble perceiving speech properly due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even claims that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have such abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two distinct pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
In each generation, the separation and re-merger between the two pools confuses the variation back and forth.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans would have difficulty meeting its amino acid requirements with available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences, including growth depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant sources to access would be proteins derived from leaves and legumes, but plants are unlikely to be digested by primates like us without being cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and then falling back to sleep shortly afterwards (about 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quieter alarm clock to just keep your consciousness alert without waking you up completely from your sleep.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn off the alarm.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep and forcing someone to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive the life force is, and every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is a teaching based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by the path of love of the mahayana and by many techniques taken from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's a path of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga is a practice of awakening the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga, where the visualization of various gods clears energy channels, activates chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and this led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, system, process and cultural conflicts divided the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was going to be fought for the next 40 years by proxy armies on the battlefields of Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been dispersed and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered invalid almost overnight when more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and opened the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to protect your country's ability to transport your people and goods, and to interfere with the enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic front of World War II, where the Americans were trying to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to deliver aid to Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using U-boats as its main ships, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably taken over Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for milk, wool, meat and easy access to mail.
Domesticated goats were often kept in herds roaming the hills or other pasturelands, often herded by goat herders, usually children or adolescents, in a manner similar to the more commonly known herders.
Wagonways were not built in England until the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than the slightly more rugged tracks of the day.
Travers were used to hold rails in place at a very early date, but over time it was discovered that rails could be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top.
This became a common practice, but caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the iron carriages.
As a result, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were put into use.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and humans started walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus, which means upright man.
The previous generation of Australopithecus could not walk normally on two legs.
The first known use of two feet is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally consciously, we can join environmental movements, we can even become activists to reduce the problems of the future a little bit.
It's like symptomatic treatment in most cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and neutralize it.
It is clear enough that the world has changed so much because of man's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been made worse by overpopulation and man's extravagant life-style.
After its adoption in Congress on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
The notices, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides", were printed in 150 to 200 copies overnight.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of these documents was sent to George Washington on July 6 to be read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The oldest known copies of the document are the 25 Dunlap pamphlets that are still in existence, although no original handwritten version has survived.
Today, most paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, and we call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
But there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have furry feet and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of the values 0 and 1, which are called bits in the field of information technology.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The most prominent sign of internal intoxication may be the presence of an open medicine bottle or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for the specific first-aid instructions for the poison in question.
The term insect is used formally by entomologists for this species of insect.
The term is derived from its ancient similarities to the bed bug, which has adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Killer Bugs and Tahtakurras are nesting animals that have adapted to living in their hosts' nests or homes.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States, which means that it is the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that having children is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
When adoption is being processed, the biological parents terminate parental rights so that the child's family can become another couple.
The fundamental purpose of science is to discover how the world works by the scientific method, and this method actually guides most scientific research.
But experiments are not alone. An experiment is a test used to ask questions, by eliminating one or more of the possible hypotheses, and observation guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
He accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including the science of the soul.
As Greek science declined, the West broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and movement are largely due to the presence of internal cycles, and the production of these cycles through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not respond to external periodic cues alone, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of free rotation even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages and viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA in either radioactive phosphorus phage or radioactive sulfur protein phage.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells alone can affect children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns to go to work in cars, passing other workers who are going to the same place they just left.
In these dynamic intermodal journeys, everyone is, in some way, connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that this huge carbon economy is disrupting the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis, are transportation engineers incompetent, or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to work on traffic flow because driver behavior can't be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably stable range, so traffic flows tend to have an acceptable consistency and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been determined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate the road facilities.
The first animals to fly were insects, whose ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily, and find food and mates more easily with less effort.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their bodies.
This gives them a wider and smaller range of places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insect species that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; they believed that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), moved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth, carrying more than eight times the second largest river.
The Amazon, with a width of up to six miles, is also the widest river on earth.
Exactly 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, draining thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramid lasted until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of their structure.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with wonder at the monuments left by their predecessors, and these monuments were more than a thousand years old at the time.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language spoken by most of the state's employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Since early times, humans have had knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, all of which can be discovered in their original state in nature and extracted with relatively simple means.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things were made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but it also theorized that they transform into new substances to take the forms we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of amethylic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
In short, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil's use and frequency declined.
People can now type messages from computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
Who knows what's going to happen to keyboard usage when something new comes out?
The fission bomb works by taking energy to bring together an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
This process is, in a sense, like lifting a handcart up a hill, reusing the core and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can be broken apart with little or no intervention.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The earth's crust is about 70 kilometers thick nearby and 100 kilometers thick farther away.
It's thinner underneath the Maria, thicker in the highlands.
Since the crust is thinner, there could be more maria on the side, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what triggers or attracts people.
These theses reveal that individuals have certain internalized needs and/or desires as they mature into adulthood.
These theories are concerned with what causes some people to desire the things they do and what causes the things around them to make them do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors may occur where managers dismiss former colleagues and begin to manage them. One aspect of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
These types of managers have difficulty making decisions that are unpopular, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks he should change everything the team does and do it himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes friction between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their close physical groups.
Because virtual teams can meet on shifting time slots that may not be understood by their local management, they often have more autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team, where each member reports to the invisible team, which sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization?
Creativity and mastery can emerge when all possible resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to overcome a barrier can be the precursor to a new innovative process that will serve the needs of customers.
To be innovative, an organisation must create a culture of innovation, as well as leadership, knowledge sharing and encouraging in-house training.
Melek (2006) describes the Sustainability approach, a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the exploration of cognition, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies is allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material support to design simulation models that help us figure out how our minds work.
While AI has a strong resemblance to science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves developing robots that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, responding to customer diagnoses and questions; handwriting, voice and facial recognition skills.
Each of these skills has become a separate discipline focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in home computers and video game software.
School trips are an important part of all classes, and teachers often love to take their students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology provides the solution by offering a virtual tour, where students can explore the structures in a museum, visit an aquarium, or be enchanted by beautiful works of art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a school trip online is a great way to share thoughts and experiences about the trip with other classes.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trips to the State Capitol each year, the website is re-edited each year, but older versions are kept online for use as a notebook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, and while students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling mistakes, the presence of a readership often changes this.
Since the most critical audience is usually students, bloggers try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them".[22] The need for followers to nurture their interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that opens the door to collaboration and encourages students to take learning beyond the traditional school curriculum.
Proper use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; students can actively respond to online material to determine their own position in the context of others' writings and their own viewpoints on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's fascinating bilingual capital, Ottawa, has many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more underscores the fact that Ontario is often described by outsiders as a self-righteous Canadian.
The vast areas to the north are sparsely populated and some consist of almost desolate wilderness.
To give you a population comparison that surprises most people: there are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of eastern Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of the islands and has a continental character of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or dependencies of France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, with the discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every female traveler state that she is married, regardless of actual civil status.
You may also find it helpful to wear a ring (not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they would call harassment, and that it's not uncommon for them to be followed, held in their arms, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences don't make it right!).
The foundations of the modern city of Casablanca were laid by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and it was also used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meronids as a strategic port, under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was later named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading centers in the city.
If you want to go shopping in Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tajin, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and various trinkets, but these are always for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Even if Goma is reasonably secure, all visits from outside Goma should be investigated in order to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.
The city, which has some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa, is also a base for those who want to climb Nyiragongo volcano.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city that attracts tourists with its fame and an airport, but it is a poor city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
The PBS special was one of Henry Louis Gates' most important stops during Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, because it has more Arab air than African air.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife.
As well as being one of South Africa's most popular attractions, it is also considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance fees and entry fees for the park.
It may be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to various parks in South Africa or to all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is considered by many visitors to be the main focal point.
The buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are likened to a glittering colonnade, further highlighted by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the coast of Kowloon across the way.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been derived from extensive land reclamation along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took for themselves, and so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Stretching some 80 km from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India, the Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world.
Sundarban has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The remaining part of the forest within the boundaries of India is called Sundarban National Park.
But forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain the last remnants of the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about one-third of which is in wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now thought to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-regional bus stop (across the river) during the day, but mostly, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy tickets several days in advance, as inter-regional buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese vans, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable means of getting to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the town of Siant-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guinea.
The two towers are 83 metres high, with two lanes 378 metres long and 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in the territory of what is now eastern Paraguay, as semi-nomadic hunters, subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to the Guaycurú, Payaguá, and other indigenous tribes, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly called the "Giant Land of the Indians", Paraguay was formed in the 16th century as a result of Spanish conquistadors' encounters with indigenous communities.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to largely preserve its indigenous identity and character since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams in the world and the best players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is pegged to a British pound sterling (GBP).
You know, the only bank in the islands that has a currency exchange, which is in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also generally accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on remote islands, but sterling and U.S. dollars may be used. Consult the owners in advance to determine the accepted payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands pound outside the islands, so change your money before you leave here.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate, with temperatures above 30°C common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold, temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make you feel colder than your thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct seasons that can be described as rainy and "dry" seasons.
Although most of the animals in the park are familiar to humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they may appear, buffalo, moose, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid having or cooking stinking food and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor, thus giving the port its unfortunate reputation.
All but one British cruiser sank, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
A peaceful meeting in the town during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement resulted in the assassination of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is in the middle of two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most have shade provided by the pohutukawa tree.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located between the Waitemata Harbour, the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a wide variety of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a very sophisticated beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing, and the other local beer is called Manta.
Although there's plenty of French wine to drink, New Zealand and Australian wines might do better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid of it, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. It is a short black 'espresso', cappuccino comes with high cream (not topped) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian by standards, the juices are expensive but delicious.
The reef is visited by many trips throughout the year, and for these reasons, reef injuries are very rare.
Nevertheless, consult with the appropriate authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear north of 1770 from October to April near the coasts and near river estuaries, and can sometimes be seen outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most of them are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live in the ocean all the time, their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance helps travelers to feel comfortable, knowing that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also choose other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to provide other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can hold your reservation for you.
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp out on the festival grounds, and most attendees see this as an important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you must go ahead to take a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music has stopped on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special campgrounds for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in winter, make sure you know where the cabin is, because crossing the ice makes a terrible noise for the sensitive.
Saint Petersburg cruises include spending time in the city.
Casinos often put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money spent by guests, and often lack windows and clocks, and exits may not be easy to find.
To keep the guests in good spirits and pleased, there are usually special offerings of food, drink, and entertainment.
Some establishments may serve alcohol, but getting drunk can affect your judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive on high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is very low, and you cannot drive as if you were on dry asphalt.
Snow storms can bring enough snow to get you stuck in the snow in a very short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by snowfall, type, condensation in vehicle windows, or icing.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is common in many countries, and traffic usually flows uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The common usage of the term safari refers to trips to observe the spectacular African wildlife, especially those that inhabit the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "nature walk", "nature walking safari", or "walking") is a walk of several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies will not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
The vast majority of event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with average prices around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Most hotels have an iron and ironing table that can be borrowed even if it is not in the room.
If you don't have a cast or don't like wearing iron socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Do not allow the fabric to overheat (this can cause it to pull or even burn in extreme cases).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in other areas, it takes several more minutes for the water to boil.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if you're concerned about this, you should consider buying your water from a well-known brand in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter insects unfamiliar to them from their own region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or spread infection.
Dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by means of infectious diseases themselves or by force are usually not included in the insect category.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save substantially, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The land between Point Marlon and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through desolate, backward areas.
If you are not used to driving in rural areas, be aware of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than the preceding and following sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and a profitable obedience to them is more important than the reverse.
Strangely, the cell phone signal here is stronger than other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good, and in Bavaria, as in its southern neighbour Austria, it is very rich and varied.
Cooked apples are put into the pastry throughout the year, and fruit pastry is common with cherries and plums showing up in the summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, nuts and other tree nuts. The highly sought-after cakes generally make a particularly good pairing with a cup of plain coffee without sugar.
If you want small but rich bakeries, try something called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on which region you're in.
Curry is a dish that includes meat or vegetables as well as dried herbs and spices.
Curry can be called "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the interior parts of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used mostly in curries; in southern India and some other coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
When referring to Indonesia, which has 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without another qualifier, the term is used for food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread in the archipelago, is distinguished by a number of basic levels of seasoning. The main spices that are important for Javanese are peanuts, bitter pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The surface is the supports for the rider's legs, which swing on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but may have safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and one of his legs gets caught in the ring and the horse runs away, the rider may be dragged.
First of all, most riders wear very tight-fitting riding boots with heels and smooth soles.
Some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety bars that allow the collared hide to fall off the saddle by pulling back a falling rider.
Chile's premier climbing destination is the Cochamó Valley, known as South America's Yosemite for its high granite walls and steep cliffs.
Peak climbing involves incredible summit views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes between endless climbing possibilities.
Downhill snow sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve skating or snowboarding down snow-covered terrain with skis attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity for many enthusiasts, also called "ski buffs", who plan their entire vacation to ski in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine discipline skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first sporting ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking: This activity is also called skiing, ski touring, or ski walking in rural areas.
It is similar to, but often slightly different from, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, which are sports performed on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as a walking route.
If the conditions are right, you'll be able to cover a lot more distance than you would walk, but without well-maintained tracks and a heavy backpack, you'll rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is home to many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to more than one country means going through many visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, in this sense, functions more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no comprehensive definition of what manufactured objects are antiques, although some tax authorities define goods as antiques when they are over 100 years old.
The definition of antiquities varies by geography, as the age limit may be shorter in regions such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be classified as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many in other professions.
Although traditional, not all Sami subsisted on large-scale reindeer husbandry, but on fishing, hunting, or similar occupations, and used reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Lapps are employed in modern professions.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments outside your own government, but their advice is for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The ideas put forward are often superficial, general, and oversimplified in comparison to more detailed information elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for hazardous weather conditions that can cause damage, serious social damage, or loss of life.
Extreme weather can be seen everywhere on Earth and has different types that can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Like high winds, hail, heavy rain, and wildfires, storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and hurricanes are among the forms and effects of severe weather.
It includes regional and seasonal types of severe weather events, such as snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather that will affect the area they are going to, otherwise travel plans may be adversely affected.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
A search for "enemy bypass" on the Internet will likely yield the address of a local company.
In a course, all the topics normally discussed here are often covered in much more detail and with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a fair amount of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with trying to survive in the wild are common, but publications dealing with overcoming war zones are rare.
Travelers planning a sex-change operation abroad should make sure they have valid documents with them on the way back.
Each government's willingness to issue gender-non-X passports or renewed documents to accommodate the desired name and gender varies.
The demand for these documents varies greatly among foreign governments.
And the searches at security checkpoints became much more invasive in the period after 9/11.
Trans people before surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without compromising their privacy and reputation.
Rip currents are currents that often return from waves that have been broken on a reef or similar shore.
Due to its underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in several deep sections, where a fast flow into deep water can occur.
Most deaths are the result of trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible, due to fatigue.
As soon as you get out of the current, the difficulty of swimming back is no different than normal.
Try to aim for a spot where you won't be caught again, or you can choose to wait for help, depending on your skills or whether you've been spotted.
Re-entry shock tends to strike sooner than culture shock, honeymoon time is shorter, it lasts longer, and it can be more severe.
Travelers who can readily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their own local culture later on.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of the customs of your native culture.
When you first go abroad, people are probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not have foreseen the need to be patient and understanding with returning passengers.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for kids in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and watch them silently before the show starts.
You hear the voices of tourists and vendors all the time, and the story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
Different countries have claimed the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and the islands have the most bases, with sixteen active bases as of 2020.
The largest island in the group is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano has created a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is in the area surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea in the south of the Peninsula.
The Peninsula mountains join the plateau here, then resurface to form the 360 km (220 mi) Ellsworth Ranges, which are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Mountains, contains Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, with the summit being Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (15,930 ft).
In remote areas where cell phone coverage is limited, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are not often used as a substitute for mobile phones, since you need to be able to see the satellite clearly to make a phone call, and to do so, you need to be outdoors.
This service is frequently used by cruise ships and transport vessels, including explorers with remote data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year off is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school dropouts, and allows them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.
Enrolling in a course abroad, often for a gap year, can actually increase your chances of returning to higher education in your home country.
Usually, a tuition fee is charged for enrollment in these training programmes.
Finland is a wonderful boating destination, and the "land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands, mostly in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't have to be in the archipelago or on the lake to have a yacht.
While the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even a boat offer a different experience.
Boating is a traditional activity in Finland, where one boat in every seven or eight people is lost.
This is consistent with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it's quite unique in that other way, for example, in the Netherlands, the number is forty-one.
Most authentic Baltic cruises include a long-term stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can sleep back on the ship at night and explore the historic city for a few full days.
From 2009, if you only go ashore by boat, you will not need a visa either.
Some cruise brochures also list Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and travel to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and cultures, especially for those who have never flown before or have experienced a trauma related to flying.
And there's no shame in that: it's no different from the personal fears and dislikes that most people have.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Courier companies are paid heavily to deliver goods quickly, often in the form of commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
Some routes have their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies were having problems.
If they sent the goods by air freight, it could have taken days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to swoon over a thick pile of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not economical, and with a rough calculation, you can pay up to four times the normal fare for business class and up to eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn't make sense to even look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines realize that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a fortune for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The country's native language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that is heavily affected by ethnic strife.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of the political talks, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been reestablished.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Izmir has now become a modern, developed and busy commercial center, largely built around a bay and surrounded by mountains.
With its 18th-century market, historic mosques and churches, the city has a more Mediterranean European air than traditional Turkey, though the wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping malls are surrounded by traditional red-tiled roofs.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views from the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are several tombs with interesting marble statues of pigeons.
It's worth taking half an hour to walk around the interesting village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, made famous by foreigners after Lord Byron recorded his eulogy to its glory.
The 403 Scotturb bus runs to Sintra with a fairly frequent stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, site of the world-famous apparition of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are visiting a mass grave site, and also an area of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are many men and women who are still alive, who managed to escape from here, and many loved ones, both Jews and non-Jews, were murdered or forced to die here.
Please treat the camp with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, and don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't disrespect them by scratching buildings or writing graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is designated by law as the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned outages are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often a false superstition, the best way to avoid trouble in Paris is to behave in a dignified manner, like a "bien élevé", which will make it much easier to avoid trouble.
The hard exterior of the Parisians will quickly fade once you've demonstrated some basic subtlety.
The Plitvice Lakes national park is a dense forested area, mostly of beech, spruce and coniferous trees, and reflects a composition of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The microclimate diversity has a fairly wide plant diversity due to different soils and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Many more common species can be found here, as well as rare fauna such as the European badger, wolf, eagle, owl, jackal, wildcat and bushbuck.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and their shoulders are also covered.
Most monasteries offer veils for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it is brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
This one can be borrowed from the pile in the lobby, but these clothes don't wash after every use, so you can be sure to wear these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, as in similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in all dishes.
A popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli, which includes bread, olive oil, tomatoes, and easily available cheeses, tuna, and other flavorings.
All names, including Sie, which means you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
While the spelling is a bit more complicated because of the need to find out if a verb or adjective is used in a noun form, it probably makes reading easier.
Italian is easier than other languages because in Italian most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The basic letters to watch out for are c and g, whose pronunciation varies with the vowel that follows.
And make sure you pronounce the r and rr differently, too: "Caro" means sweetheart, and "carro" means carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy and predominantly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand expressions.
Needless to say, learning Portuguese will be easier if you know a language from the Latin family.
However, even those who know some Spanish may also conclude that Portuguese is too close to Spanish in a short time to need to study it.
Premodern observatories are today generally outdated and continue to exist as museums or educational spaces.
In their heyday, light pollution was not as much of a problem as it is today, but they are often found in cities or on campuses that are more accessible than those established in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom scene known as hanami has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where the most popular flowers are plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor, and only he and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court could attend.
Plants look their best when they're in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" sample.
If you visit an officially regulated garden, collecting "samples" also makes you an uncontested expungement.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to get around, so you can get everything you want as soon as you arrive.
But in Singapore, just a few degrees north of the equator, in the "high tropics", you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (rarely, when the weather is clear).
There are several buses that go to El Halil, the traditional burial place of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives, apostles mentioned in the Bible.
Make sure that the bus you are considering taking does not only go to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, but also to El Khalil.
As the main theme of a holiday, drinking water can be a good option.
For example, visiting the Loire Valley, the castles in the Rhine Valley, or taking a ferry trip to interesting towns on the Danube River, or a boat tour along the Erie Canal.
They also designate routes for popular nature walks and bike trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians around the world.
It is customary to spend the night without sleeping on Easter in an open field to watch the sunrise.
There are Christian explanations for this tradition, of course, but it's possible that it was a pre-Christian ritual symbolizing spring and fertility.
More traditional churches hold the Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, and congregations often begin midnight celebrations to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the first animals to arrive on the islands came here by swimming, flying or gliding.
The distance to the mainland prevented the mammals from making the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos, many mammals have been brought in, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter months, you experience the polar night, which means that the sun never rises above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark almost every hour.
Since the regions are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese business culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Standard work attire is a suit, and co-workers address each other by their surnames or job titles.
It's more important to have a workplace that underlines the group effort than to celebrate individual achievements.
Workers must often seek the approval of their superiors for any decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' orders without question.
