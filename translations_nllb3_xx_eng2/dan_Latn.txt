Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely held, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut brown at the top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a feather shaft, but have other features of feathers - rays and beams - the researchers deduced that feathers were likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or ornamentation. The researchers thought that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult feather coat and not a chicken's down.
The researchers believe that the tail sample from the young dinosaur shows the plumage of an adult individual and not the plumage of a chicken.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and is made up of lots of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and cause for alarm because of its very high mortality rate".

"Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are fairly deep holes in the ground, although they do not behave as stably as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature around the clock".
In Franconia, voting has traditionally been low-tech: Voters isolate themselves in a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in the French electoral law.
Since 1988 ballot boxes have been transparent, so that voters and observers can see that the ballot boxes do not contain ballots at the start of voting and that no ballots are added other than those correctly spelled out and coming from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and following specific procedures.

The police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and we have found her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused met in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering his son.
She is being held in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be flawed because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and the courts have considered the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should be careful if they publish images of suspects or others".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be given, at least until the indictment is in place.
According to the leaked document, it will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the pre-Six-Day War borders of 1967.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problems of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement has been signed, whereas the Palestinian authorities agree to leave the valley for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control experiment had to be closely monitored by park officials as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and cultural heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) was sworn in by Martelly yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the resignation of the former CEP was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, defective iPods have been overheated, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had been aware of 27 accidents involving the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Response Office announced that there were no reports of any casualties in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took an elderly woman's seat when she went to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" aircraft recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, and Luna died on the night of the two moons, quite remarkable, like herself, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as I am... maybe even more so... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Incorporated Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the various extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there have been doubts about his condition.
He was unable to take the medication necessary to combat his pain, as these are prohibited during the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using various hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth was formed since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and stupidity".
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says allows planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel a year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility that one would be forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would have taken much longer because of mating between the endemic Darwin's finch Geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin cable that can be twisted and braided, it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and placed on other metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Brintions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Shake the two dry powders together and then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization they were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women mingled in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space requires a giant rocket that's over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing that the wheel has done for us is it has given us much easier and faster modes of transportation.
It has given us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including loose domestic cats) eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and their young.
The females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds react much like wolves or dogs in packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete, able to climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the high roar of a lion but sounds more like a phrase of squealing, shouting words.
Ocelots prefer small animals, and they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smell, sniffing out where they have been on the earth.
They have excellent night vision in the dark, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (as if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily move back), it will often find itself in a different environment than it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what was previously necessary.
The original population has not changed at all, and it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex, nothing could stand against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a septuplets.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed having large banquets together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of its life outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the shops were just open disks facing the street; stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living in the area at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a tax card is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a back inscription, it is not a tax card.
Written on the back of the United States Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So it is likely that the note was merely added as an addition.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - there are Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, substantial group of people living together and cooperating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; and it also defines in some way the size of society.
City states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-lasting cultural influence and equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  with Congress as the only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial system, they were dependent on state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all actions.
Nor did it have the right to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous acceptance by all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team is, along with Germany's national football team, the second most successful team in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "island group".
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which started a change from the original grain production practices, and employed Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Peace of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which may be confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (for example, the APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains a certain order in a picture.
It says that the most effective location for the main motif is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
This period in European history was marked by the rise of the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervasive power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the most important Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources should be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was being properly followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain instituted a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, preventing the passage of vital military and civilian supplies, in violation of recognized international law, codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the attitudes of most citizens and nations were toward pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; each Chinese time period or ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same is true of the military, for instead of rank-based ranking in the army, ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life, and he used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists, because when you're inside the cave, it's a total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen, and very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the world-famous Great Pyramid being the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up' arrow mark resembles a 'V' and the 'down' arrow mark resembles a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
As a rule, upstrokes produce a softer sound, while downstrokes produce a louder and more powerful sound.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed arrow marks are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their chariot wide open.
At one point, a member of the Mafia displayed the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war costs of the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for the bulk of the expenses, and the bond interest ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the super profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context in which the order was founded.
The period of time in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that occurred in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that relates to scientific laws and the way they manifest themselves in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on societies that is hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, the motor car is said to necessarily lead to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The increased number of car owners has led to more accidents on the roads, and this has led to the development of new medical techniques for healing injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic era, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerged that were in harmony with the location of society and therefore were better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris today is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known to have been an epicenter of luxury since about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silks and spices that were worth more than the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was largely inspired by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, the Western styles were able to lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characteristic because of the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People belonging to a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children, through failure, accident or deliberate neglect, have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Some children who are "wild" have been deprived of their freedom by humans (often their own parents); in some cases, this failure was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical weaknesses.
Wild children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviour (within physical limits) that is almost identical to that of the animal that has cared for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, staggering goes one step further.
The secondary training is not a learning method but a support for people who need to learn new things - for example, how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalised in the software and are intended to question, ask for and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children come into foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care and education, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family is responsible for providing all the necessities that were not available in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, it is suggested that 'learning' and 'socialisation' are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microimpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Twenty-first-century research has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added by mutation and removed from the pool of exact variations by selection.'
Separation and recombination blends the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of noncompliance: stunted growth, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they're cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ant, termite, egg) is not only easy to digest but also provides a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the clock while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing you to get up and recharge.
The amount of inner calm a person possesses is the exact opposite of the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and all humans have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is brought to life (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in the countries' systems, processes and culture led to the countries opposing each other.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army occupied and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to be able to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to transport troops and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
As far as is known, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Household goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often supervised by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known shepherds.
As early as the 16th century, wagon roads were built in England.
Even though the wagon tracks were simply parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more rough roads of the day.
Swabs were invented early on to hold tracks in place, but eventually it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first rails made entirely of metal were used.
The first known method of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Two-legged specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and man's extravagant life-styles.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congress president John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to him by his soldiers in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving copy of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, for now, in computer language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both bed bugs and caterpillars are nestless, which means that they are adapted to live in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
Adoption is the process by which the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually used in most scientific research.
But it doesn't stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in the fields of physiology and behaviour often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-driving oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they marked either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape and its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks, as well as studies of information on the ecosystem.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
In the morning, people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system that is based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has detached the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems.
In developed lands, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; so traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships are established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road systems.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a greater choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the goldsmith and the dayfly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Opinions were divided about his theory - some thought he was right, while many thought the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
It makes sense, because we don't feel the earth rotating, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on earth, containing over eight times as much water as the second-largest river on earth.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, reaching up to six miles (about 9.6 km) in width in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River draws water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size of their constructions and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City State is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of the Vatican City State are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine with the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is used less since new writing methods have appeared.
People now type messages through computer screens and never have to go near a pencil point.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, but when the nucleus splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break down under little or no stress.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the front and 100 kilometers thick on the back.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There could be several lunar gardens on the front, as the crust here is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around figuring out what makes people respond, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
Theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to do certain things and what elements in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour that can arise when a manager starts to manage his former colleagues.
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behaviour often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same expectations of expertise are set for virtual teams as for conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organisation.
As a result, the process in an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organisations to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and therefore narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models with that can help us understand our mental processes.
Although AI is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves being able to make machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military industries, as it has been incorporated into several home computers and computer game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom, and quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where bus travel is not possible.
The technology offers virtual excursion solutions, allowing students to view museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a good way to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is rebuilt, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, "blogging forces students to become smarter about the world around them". The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written and describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and other areas of untapped natural beauty.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered authentically Canadian by outsiders.
Farther north, there are large areas that are rather sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape Route between Europe and India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is reasonable to wear what may look like a wedding ring (it should just not look too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meronites as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of nips, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located just east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated in order to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu Province.
It is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and one of the cheapest places in Africa to track mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
This, coupled with the city's relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country because it has a more Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and admission fees to the park.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the primary focus area.
The Hong Kong skyline is a group of buildings that, by their reflection in the water of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering column diagram.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated in dense land areas along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 50 miles [80 km] from the coast and into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List, and the part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last remaining vegetation of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/moose areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the Interregional Bus Station (across the river) all day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and robust Japanese buses.
Deletaxa are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 273 feet [83 m] high, the bridge is 1,900 feet [378 m] long, and it has two lanes that are 12 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[1] Construction was completed in August 2011.[2] It was opened to traffic in March 2017.[3]
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant group of indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of India", came into existence in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world's best polo teams and some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, consult the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is fixed at the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also commonly accepted within Stanley.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance for the method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, and in the summer months, temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards [100 yards] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 yards] from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, moose, bears, and virtually any large animal can make a good attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get hurt because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the setting for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except for a British cruiser, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two harbors, and the most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most of them receive natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
Drinking the local tap water is safe, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "short black" is called an "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many people visit the reef year-round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always follow the advice of the authorities, read and obey the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770, and occasionally outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the sea, their primary habitat being estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservations give travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals on specific hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even combined air and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and many attendees consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, you'll have to get in early to get a tent near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
Check where your cabin is if you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to you.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms), which is good to know, as cruises to St Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to make sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and in the house.
In some places alcoholic beverages are served on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all serious gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone who has to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and minus degrees.
On icy and slippery roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to cause you to become stuck.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling snow or wind, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and slippery conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows for the most part uninterrupted all year round.
For many, safaris are the highlight of their trip and perhaps the biggest attraction for tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to overland trips to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so standard equipment is sufficient to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A bush walk (also called a "walking safari") consists of hikes that take either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having also hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your 2020 flights and your 2020 accommodations before the postponement was announced, you could be in trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow even if there is not one in the room.
If you cannot use an iron or if you do not like to wear socks that have been ironed, try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to allow the substance to become too hot (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn marks).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unknown to them at home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
Be careful if you are not used to driving on country roads: steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns abound.
The speed limits are markedly lower than on the lines before and after - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them precisely.
Strangely enough, cell phone coverage is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied, just as in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit-based pastries are common: apples are baked into cakes all year round, and cherries and flowers make their appearance during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you fancy a small but full-bodied cake, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, when used without further elaboration, the term typically refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine consists of a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the most popular seasonings being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse runs away.
First, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety harnesses that allow the handlebars to be released from the saddle if they are pulled behind a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a series of large granite walls and cliffs.

Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve driving down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski bumpers" - planning their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 B.C.E. show people on skis!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not usually involve, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You're gonna see the ski trail as if it were a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat more distances than if you walk  but it is very rare that you will get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport controls several times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorised as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture around it is also important for many Sámi with other professions.

Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Hostile Environment Courses" will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are common, but there are not many publications dealing with war zones.

Transgender passengers who have not had surgery should not expect to get through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves that return and break on the shore, often at a reef or similar, is called a countercurrent.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current to deep water can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it's no harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might be able to wait for rescue.
Homecoming shock comes more quickly than culture shock (there is not as much of a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a very difficult time adjusting to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in a new country needs to adjust.
People do not necessarily expect that it is necessary to show patience and understanding when returning home as a traveler.
The Pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.

In remote areas without cell service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you must be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One option that is becoming more popular among those planning a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during your sabbatical year may actually improve your chances of obtaining a place in higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these training programmes.
Finland is a wonderful destination for sailors. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the archipelagos along its coast.
In the islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, a smaller boat or even a kayak is a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, then go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

Delivery companies charge a premium for fast delivery, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they were shipping by air, some routes could have taken days to get through customs and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put up a big pile of money to get the opportunity (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
This is not cheap, though: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal business class price of economy class and eleven times the price of first class!
In general, there is no need to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting there quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.

The cool exterior of Paris evaporates quickly if you exhibit basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with forested areas - mainly beech and coniferous trees - and offers a mixture of both alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types and varying elevation levels.

Along with many more common species, it is home to rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, moose, wildcat and bull.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees while also covering their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries have headscarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can be borrowed from the storage room at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel completely safe wearing these skirts.

Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at blooming cherry trees, known as hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
