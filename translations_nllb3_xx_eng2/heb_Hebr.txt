Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already gaining ground, but it also provides details that LAR fossils are usually able to provide, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's feathers were a warm, amber-brown on top with a pale cartenoid tint on the underside.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed stalk, called a quill, but have other features of feathers - fins and eyelids - the researchers concluded that quills were probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display. The researchers suggest that although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows feathers of an adult animal rather than a chick's plumage.
The researchers suggested that, although it's a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows an adult plumage rather than a chick's plumage.

Most of the work was theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The impact the team was looking for was caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides to rise and fall, the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in a galaxy's environment is around the galaxy in a sort of shadow, and it's made up of lots of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been an experience of simple technology: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed envelope indicating the candidate they are voting for.
After the officials verify his identity, the voter sends the envelope to the ballot box and stamps the ballot.

Candidates can send representatives to serve as witnesses at any stage of the process. In the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Police Major Chandra Shekar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adakoya has since appeared in court in Edinburgh and has been charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting conviction and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised as her picture has gone public.
It's common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and courts have seen the publication of images as potentially biased.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that it seems that journalists are indeed willing to take risks if they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Legal Service, which handles all claims, has informed reporters that no further comment will be given at least until a conviction.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border conflict, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
Other topics reportedly discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, holy to both peoples, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep such a presence for only five years.
It was determined that the shooters in the additional pest control experiment should be under the close supervision of foresters, as the experiment is under supervision and its effectiveness is under evaluation.
"In partnership with the Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Rifles Association of Australia, qualified volunteers have been recruited as part of the Sporting Rifles Association's hunting program".
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of the NPWS's Heritage and Conservation Park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting attempt received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday appointed a new nine-member provisional election committee.
This is Martelli's fifth C.E.P. in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the dismissal of the former Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were sparked by the failure of elections, which were due to take place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods that overheated have been reported, a problem that led to six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of global warming, which the company deemed not serious".
"The firm responded by calling Apple's rejection of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reports no damage in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research the subject of premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that taking the hormone would accelerate the fetal lung development of the baby.
"Singapore News Agency reports that government investigators found black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also shared their respect for Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said Luna was the first queen of the Hacks, my first director, Luna died on the night of the two moons, as unique as she was, a strong woman".
"Dustin Goldust Runnels said that Luna was a freak like me... maybe even more so... I love her and I miss her...
Of the 1,400 people who returned to the polls for the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
The caretaker Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the poll's end, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness was called into question.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome his pain because it's banned in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various materials and software in early February and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water arriving on Earth, along with organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He dismissed the rumors as political chatter and nonsense".
Speculation is that he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
"It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology based on the ground, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information".
No transportation has been added and trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and travel facilities are not available on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the game will be forced to be held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was previously thought that the process took much longer, due to crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin's peach (Geospiza fortes) and the large migratory cactus peach (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin thread, which can be twisted and folded. It can be ground or flattened into a mat.
"It can be made very thin and pasted onto another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator out of red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color according to the degree of acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with wet, clean hands, make a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
In the cities of Arapahoe and Moenjo-daro, there was a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the homes of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, the bathroom was sometimes part of a public bathhouse where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then transmits it back down, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and mirrors.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, and the greatest thing it has done for us is give us a much lighter and faster means of transportation.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the much larger small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the nest, a special role each cat fulfills that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called herds.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males, along with no less than 30 females and pups.
The females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave very similarly to wolf or dog herds, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and as such are particularly lethal to their prey.
Being highly athletic, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (a panther type) as the lion, the tiger and the iguana. These four cats are the only ones that can growl.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's powerful jaw, it's more like a sentence of words shouted in eagerness.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the Ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists think that ocelots find prey and track them by smell, by the smell of the ground they've passed.
They can see perfectly in the dark through night vision, and also sneak silently.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they arrived (such as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
In this new environment there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations than they have in the past to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adjustments they did before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they can't be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Moosazaurus was the super predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other moosazaurs.
Its long jaws were pierced by more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth meant that anyone caught in its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a tongue with a cleft palate, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other mussels, and he may have even been a cannibal.
In addition, it attacked any creature that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex could not withstand it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans did have some odd or unusual items for the feast, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a nymph.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to host meals together where they rubbed their sides while they ate their meals.
It's impossible that ancient Roman cuisine included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and a sacred inner temple that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special temple to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house didn't mean that much.
Most of the Hebrew family life was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his travels westward he discovered Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each of these countries was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen a national treasure movie, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words, 'The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.' The text appears at the bottom of the document, in reverse".
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that in early times, the large card document (sized 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was scraped for storage.
So, it's likely that the additional markings are just labels.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, who were Frenchmen who had collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and acted alongside the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by an extremely large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means citizen, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and also defines in some way the size of society.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture implies the passing of knowledge between several generations, a cultural footprint and a relatively large distribution.
Minor civilizations often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax and, because it had no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce its laws.
And it had no authority to circumvent the laws of taxation and tariffs between states.
The statute required unanimous consent from all the states before an amendment could be added, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were mostly absent.
"The Italian national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful national team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion".
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international events and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
"Because of Japan's cluster of islands, it is often defined as an archipelago from a geographical point of view".
"The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilya Formosa, or Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, prompting a change in traditional grain-growing practices and the employment of Chinese laborers in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1912-1644) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which had ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the site have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration continues to this day.
"For example, the world's most common still-film format is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era".
It's still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from digital camera image formats.
"The dimensions of the 35mm format are actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high".
So the width-to-height ratio of this format (twelfths to get the simplest whole number ratio) should be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or close to this latitude-to-longitude ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been subject to ridicule and abuse, is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in the picture.
It states that the most effective place for the central subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal triangles (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subject to severe criticism.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
Her penetrating power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the central beliefs in Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are specifically designed for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to wonder if this principle had been preserved.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain laid a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, though this siege violated the accepted international rules that have been signed into a number of international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain had been laying mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a response similar to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing position of most citizens and countries was one of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horror and horrors of war in World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
"In 1884, Tesla moved to Arabia to take a job with the Edison Company in New York".
"He came to America with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison".
Ancient China had its own way of representing different time periods; each stage in Chinese history or each ruling family had a unique dynasty.
Also, there was an unstable era of divided provinces between the dynasties, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the crown.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, professions were open to any man who wanted them, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This is true of the military because instead of ranks being based on rank, they were now based on ability.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired many more of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this material life. He would often command a cave known as the Kaira on Mount Noor to immerse himself in deep contemplation".
The cave itself, which has survived through history, provides a very rich picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave sits atop a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all even if you know it exists.
You can't see anything but the beautiful clear sky above and the many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plain, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family.
"The upper bow mark looks like a V and the lower bow mark like a trigger pin or square without its lower edge".
Up means to start at the end and push the bow, and down means to start at the bow (the position of the hand in the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own notes, but remember that the notes are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be adhered to.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly settled in Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowds forced the king and queen to open their chariot windows wide.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved the head of a royal guard soldier killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism for the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a significant part of the expenses and interest on bonds that were issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people will be the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The era in which these events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that lasted throughout the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The high point of the Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally accepted to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from push technology or technological dictation to an entrenched sense that human destiny is based on logic derived from the laws of nature and their expression in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology develops in a way that is not heavily influenced by culture or politics, and that technology has effects on societies that are socially constructed, rather than socially conditioned".
For example, you could say that the car is necessarily leading to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed in order to lower the cost of car ownership.
The proliferation of private cars also increases the frequency of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health to repair bodily injuries.
The Romantic movement contained a large element of cultural determinism inspired by writers such as Goethe, Pieta and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures associated with this geography arose, and these, thanks to their harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its publication as a luxury publication began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
It declined in status during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk robes and spices whose value was higher than that offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was during this period that the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was deeply influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the countries of Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the period, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming designed to produce enough food to meet the exact needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, method that uses seeds preserved from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize rotation.
Throughout history, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and that's still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture typically mark their membership with a unique and symbolic use of style that includes fashion, slang, and idioms.
One of the most common ways to re-emphasize the importance of socialization is to learn from the sad, isolated cases of children who, because of neglect, bad luck or intentional abuse, did not experience adult socialization while growing up.
"Some of the wild children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child has occurred because of the parents' refusal to accept a severe mental or physical defect in the child".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by nonhuman animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (with physical limitations) almost identical to those of the animal that raised it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the Pygmalion method goes one step further.
Pygmalion is not a learning method but a learning aid that supports people going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The piggy banks can be virtual or real, in other words, teachers are a form of piggy bank but also the little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Pygmies are embedded in software and designed to ask, respond to, and explain challenging processes that students may have difficulty coping with on their own.
Children are sent to foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child in the world deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We think of the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health services.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to content.
"For example, it has been argued that learning and socialization are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995)".
"Personal engagement and ongoing relationships were also identified as new motivational traits by Amy and Moord (1998) when studying audience responses to websites".
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-gestures, which are facial movements that last several thousandths of a second.
And specifically, it's been claimed that you can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, noted how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggested such abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic diversity, and selection erases it from the manifested pool of diversity.
Segregation and recombination blend the differences back and forth between the two stores with each generation.
In the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most available plant resources were the available proteins in the leaves and the pods, but for primates like us, it's hard to digest them if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"Given all the data, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same ways that chimpanzees in the savannah use today".
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately falling asleep during your normal sleep time and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing the former to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of stress in the person's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force is, and every person has the potential to achieve total peace and contentment.
The only thing that separates him from our goals is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but this has been expanded by the Mahayana way of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it includes the Kundalini, yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is evoked through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and imagination.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the divine being. Through visual thought of various divine beings the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
"Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Emirates. At the end of the war, the contradictions of systems, processes and cultures led to conflict between the countries".
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
"It took place over the next 40 years and the actual fighting was carried out by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places".
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only chance was to retreat and re-establish themselves along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
Using cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country can keep moving your people and products, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and products.
One of the most prominent recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably succeeded in conquering Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Early cultures and tribes began to keep them for convenient access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were in many cases children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar shepherd. These herding methods are still in use today.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were built from only parallel timber sources, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the period.
The cross-linking was introduced early enough to hold the rails in place, but it gradually became clear that the rails would be more efficient if they had a rail at the top.
This became the accepted procedure, but the iron further chipped the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known form of mobility was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often as they did.
Walking on two legs has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago, although Cthulhu may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and we can even be environmental activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases it's just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and we need to neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been compounded by humanity's population density and dispersed lifestyle.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap Sleeves".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap scrolls that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But a lot of things in birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and seams, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T. Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only contain one or two values, i.e., 0 or 1, these numbers are referred to as binary numbers  or bits, depending on the professional computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that they do not allow for immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open medicine cabinet or or open bottles of household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this toxin.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that have largely adapted to parasitic relationships with humans.
Both bed bugs and torpedo bugs are nest-dwellers that have adapted to living in their host's nest or home.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), so it's still the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to go through an adoption program for their baby.
When adopting, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can be the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
But it's not the only one -- an experiment, and an experiment is a test that's used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guides scientific research.
"Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially the Latin Bible".
Aristotle's views were accepted by all branches of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior, which often depend critically on the presence of internal cycles, and are created by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic cues, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining clocks that continue for a period of time in a fixed cycle even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading claims that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacterium.
They did two experiments where we labeled the DNA in phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are stem-line cells.
Only mutations in cells from the germ layer can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their work and pass other people who are the same as where they just left.
In this dynamic transportation vehicle, everyone is somehow connected and supportive of a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this vast carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same amount of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems draw such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are they the work of unskilled transportation engineers? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the field that studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior tends to stay within a consistent range of logic; therefore, traffic flow generally has a logical consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we have correlated the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects enjoy the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This fact gives them a wider range of small places where they can hide from the crazies.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are flies and moths.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite to be true; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and other stars).
That makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that leaks from the Earth's tunnels into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
"The central Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers".
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, no structure has ever surpassed the Giza Pyramids in size and construction excellence.
Ancient Egyptians from the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populated.
The Vatican Secretariat uses Italian in its legislation and in its official media.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the people who work in the country, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, developed the theory that everything was made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also argued that they were transformed into new materials to create what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
So, since it came into use, the pencil has been a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil's status and use declined.
People are now typing messages on computer screens, and they never have to go near a sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The fusion bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Nuclear fission again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust.
"The thickness of the ice is about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side".
It's thinner under the ridges and thicker under the levels.
There may be more lunar bodies on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding the same factor that motivates or charms people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they instill as they grow older.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors can erupt when people become the managers of their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to stay one of the guys".
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, making disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes unrecognizable and feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are required to the same professional standards as regular teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as liaisons with their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
"The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The invisible team is the management team to which all team members are subordinate. The invisible team sets the benchmarks for each team member".
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and resourcefulness can emerge.
As a result, a process of organizing workers together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, so it narrows the field and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build blood models, which help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although AI evokes strong connotations of science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and adaptive design of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and time management, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, in addition to handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. It has also been implemented in a number of home computer programs and video games.
Tours play a big role in every classroom. Often a teacher will be happy to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can look at museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or marvel at fine art while sitting next to their classmates.
Sharing a virtual trip together is also a great way to observe the trip and share future classes experiences.
For example, every year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina build a website on their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online to serve as a memoir.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy spelling and punctuation, audience presence often changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to aspire to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also forces students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting". - Toto, 2004.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs may empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their own position in the context of others' writing, as well as formulate their own point of view on certain issues (Oraver, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it has a variety of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south of there are Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of the Moscocca District and beyond.
All of these and more make Ontario seem like an outsider to a typical Canadian city.
Large areas north of there are relatively sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness areas.
"The population comparison that surprises many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens".
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by a wide margin, and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or linked to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it bought a large hold in Comoro and Miot.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, with the discovery by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every female traveler state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also advisable to wear a ring, but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they would have seen as harassment, and that it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their testicles, and so on.
There have been attacks on rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourselves (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
"The modern city of Casablanca was founded by barbarian fishermen in the tenth century BC, and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Maronites as a strategic port called Anfa".
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading centers there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the Old Country it's easy to find places selling traditional handicrafts, such as tadjis, pottery, leather goods, handkerchiefs, and a whole range of small items, but all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo far to the east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo which buried most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Goma may be relatively safe, but any visit outside Goma should be checked to understand the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest trails in Africa following the mountain gorilla.
You can use a Bodh-Bodh (motorcycle taxi) to get around the dome. The usual (local) price is about 500 Kongels for a short ride.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands".
Today, Timbuktu is a city in decline, though thanks to its reputation it is still a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger of desert sands.
"It was one of the main stops during the Henry Louis Gates special on PBS's Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has an Arab flavor more than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
"The park spans 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological environments, each supporting a different wildlife".
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are two-day park maintenance and admission fees.
You may also want to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to select parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is where Rabin tourists are treated as a major focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart revealed by the presence of Victoria Harbour Water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon coastline opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated in backward land along the northern coast.
It's where the British settlers saw their place, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
"The Sundarbans is the largest free-ranging mangrove belt in the world, stretching from the coast for 80 kilometers (50 miles) into the interior of Bangladesh and India".
"The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park".
But forests are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic plain.
"The Sundarbans extends over 3,850 km, of which about a third is covered by water areas or grasslands".
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer spotted in the area.
Buses leave the Interprovincial Bus Station (across the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those facing east and Jacar/Boomtang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since inter-provincial buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of travel to nearby destinations, such as Faro (150 Bhutanese NGL) and Punakha (200 Bhutanese NGL).
The Aipok River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Aipok River to connect the cities of Aipok, Brazil, and Saint-Georges-de-l'Aipok, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 273 feet, are 1,900 feet long, and have two 12-foot-wide lanes.
The minimum height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be ready.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuru and the Paiagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"Sixteenth-century Paraguay, once called the vast province of the Indians, was born as a result of an encounter between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three hundred years.
Since the founding of the Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players who are some of the best in the world.
The big tournament of the year was held in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
You can also see tournaments and smaller games here at other times of the year.
For news of tournaments and places to buy tickets to polo games, search the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falklands Pound (FKP) whose value is defined as the equivalent of one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound will be accepted by the way everywhere in the islands and inside Stanley will often also accept credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards may not be accepted in remote islands, although British and American money may be accepted. Check with the owner beforehand to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so they exchanged money before leaving.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so when it's summer in the northern hemisphere, it's winter in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C.] are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the compressor makes it look.
"There are no defined rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains constant throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from all other wildlife!
No matter how comfortable they appear, bison, Canadian deer, reindeer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying on your body and cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
"The harbour was the site of a famous naval dispute in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour".
All ships were sunk except one British patrol ship, and nearly 200 Germans and Englishmen lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by Mao's movement, peaceful mobs in the city led to the killing of Supreme Leader Topua Tamasa for the third time.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is spread over two islands. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore (North Harbor County) shores are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches safe for swimming, and most of them have shade provided by pohotokawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata anchorage, in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a great variety of shops along the shore.
"The main local beer is 'Number One,' it's not a complicated beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more resistant to travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but for those who are afraid, bottled mineral water is very easy to find.
To Australians, the concept of a flat white coffee is unfamiliar. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with plenty of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Belgian standard hot cocoa, expensive but excellent fruit juices.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these factors on the reef are rare.
Still, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cuban jellyfish appear near the coast and river mouths from October to April of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will stay away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind and the confidence that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of a flight and a hotel.
They can also keep the invitation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should go through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to stay on site, and most attendees see this as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you'll have to get in early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may be over, there may still be areas of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cell, as ice crossing causes quite a terrible noise in the cells most exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Typically, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are often missing, and it is not easy to find the exit.
They often have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises.
Some places offer drinks on the house, but getting drunk impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On ice-covered and snow-covered roads, friction is low and you can't drive like you would on bare asphalt.
In a blizzard, enough snow to stick you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing in the wind, or by fog or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari trips are perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and headline-grabber for many travelers.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland travel to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow you to observe them comfortably.
Lions, cheetahs and tigers are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called bushwalking, backpacking safari, or jogging) consists of a walking tour of a few hours or a few days".
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the cancellation was announced, you may have run into a problem.
There are a variety of cancellation policies, but since the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not cover until July 2020, the date set for the Olympics.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with most tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an ironing board and ironing board available for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no ironing available, or if you do not care to iron socks, you may try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the vein (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of different filters is not constant, and if you have concerns, you might want to consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them from their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Self-infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually defined as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers who come to countries with high taxes can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Upper Pittsburgh Highway, and it often passes through desolate and isolated terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: There are many steep stairs, narrow lanes, and sharp bends on the road.
"The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/ h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual".
Strangely, cell phone reception is much stronger here than along many other sections of the trail, like the wilderness areas of Pennsylvania.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, it's rich and varied, similar to those in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common. Apple pies can be found year-round while cherries and plums come in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are usually especially suited to a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called according to the different regions Berliner, Pancake or Krappen.
Curry is a dish based on spices and herbs, in addition to meat or vegetables.
"Carrie can be dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid".
In the mainland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But when used without further description, the term refers to food that originates from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simply prepared dishes, and the prominent flavors that Javanese people like are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (mostly Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
Rides provide support for the rider's legs that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders use riding boots with smooth, tight heels and soles.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle's skin to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cuchamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and large granite cliffs.
At the summits, there are breathtaking views from the tops of the mountains, and climbers from all over the world are constantly building new routes into the infinite potential of the walls.
Sloping snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports based on sliding down a snow-covered surface using skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
"Skiing is a major outdoor activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums, planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting people skiing date back to 5000 BC!
"Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians".
Skiing backpacks: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related to but usually does not include alpine-style skiing or mountain climbing, the latter being performed on steep terrain and requiring much harder boots and skis.
Think of a ski trail as a trail that's similar to a hike.
In good conditions you can cover greater distances than walking - but only very rarely will you get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on trails that have been trained for it.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries requires going through the visa application process and passport control many times.
The Shangan region, on the other hand, acts a bit like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in the area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, so we save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what goods are considered antique. Certain taxing bodies define goods over a hundred years old.
The definition has geographical variations, and the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products may be considered antiques, even though they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
Reindeer farming is an important source of income for the Sami people and the surrounding culture is also important to many other professions.
But even traditionally, not all the Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, but they did fish, hunt and things like that, and they kept reindeer mainly as livestock for transportation.
Today many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami people of the Sami region.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word gypsy is often considered offensive because of the associations it raises with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people".
If the country you are visiting receives a travel alert, this may affect your health insurance or your airline insurance.
You should consult the governments of other countries, but their advice is for their own citizens.
As one example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel warnings are just a short summary of the political situation in a particular country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and overly abstract compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous climatic event that may cause damage, serious disruption of social order or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and raging fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events are strong winds, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the danger of severe weather in the area as it may interfere with travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be defined as a war zone should receive professional training.
"An Internet search for a hostile environment course will likely come up with the address of a local company".
A standard course will include all the topics discussed here in more detail, usually alongside practical experience.
The course will typically last between two and five days and include role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications on war zones are few.
Passengers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without an X-mark or documents updated to fit the desired name and gender is changing.
The difference in the willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is just as great.
Security checkpoints have also become much more invasive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to be able to pass through the scanners without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Backstreams are the current that comes back from breaking waves on the shore, often in a reef and so on.
Because of the underwater topology, the returning current is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current into deep water may be formed there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue, due to trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or depending on your skills and if you've been spotted, you might want to wait for a rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (it has less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to re-adapt to the culture they were born into.
When you come home after living in a foreign country, you've adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first arrived in a foreign country, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to new countries need to adjust.
People may not expect that it will take as much patience and understanding for travelers returning home.
The pyramid's light-sound show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the voices of the tourists and the vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as the background and the number of a long story.
The scenes are shown on top of the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest number of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies about 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrías.
The others include Livingston Island and Dispensation, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano still provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern area of the peninsula, bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsular mountains merge into the plain, then resurface to form the 200-mile chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, the highest of which rises to an elevation of 4,892 m (16,029 ft) and is Mount Vinson.
In remote places with no cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a cell phone, since you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by vessels, including pleasure craft, as well as research missions requiring remote data and voice communications.
Your local telephone company should provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
A possibility that is becoming increasingly popular for those who plan a year off is to travel and study.
It's especially popular with high school seniors, and it allows them to take a year off before college, without compromising their education.
"In many cases, enrolling in a course during a bridge year in the sand may actually improve your chances of getting into higher education in your home country".
A tuition fee is usually charged for enrollment in such programs.
"Finland is a great sailing destination. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, lakes and archipelagos off the coast".
In the archipelago of islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the archipelagos of the largest coastal areas and lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
It's similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but beyond that it's unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one in forty).
Most special Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It means you can visit the historic city for a few full days and then go back to sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only arrive at the coast via sailing trips, you will not need a separate visa (valid for 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany, marked on their billboards. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying a plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they've never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different than the personal fear or disgust of other things that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight may help to overcome the fear that is based on uncertainty and lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is a very important factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Some of the routes have larger companies flying their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they were airlifting things, on some routes unloading and customs clearance could take several days.
The only way to get through this faster was to send it as registered cargo.
The obvious way to fly business or first class is to pay a large sum for the privilege (or better yet, to have your workplace pay for it).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay for business class up to four times the normal tourist fare, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there's no point even in looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know full well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destinations quickly and comfortably, and charging accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
"In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment and declaration of independence of the Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the UN member states".
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million people, the second largest port after Istanbul and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, today it's a modern, thriving and busy commercial center, surrounded by a vast bay and mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red roofs, the 18th-century bazaar and ancient mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey.
The village of Halderswick overlooks the nearby island of Astoria and has an unusual stone church.
In the churchyard there are statues of pigeon-like things over some graves.
A tour of the curious village is worth half an hour.
A short distance to the north you will find the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, known to outsiders for Lord Byron's brilliant description of its beauty.

In addition to the convent, you can visit the great residence of Our Lady of Fatima, where the world-famous apparitions of Mary took place.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, and a site that has almost unimaginable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more whose loved ones were murdered or enslaved to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the respect, the seriousness and the respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by marking or graffitiing on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are written only in Catalan because it is designated by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular messages in the metro are delivered in Catalan only, but unplanned outages are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egotistical, impudent and arrogant.
"Although often it is just an inaccurate stereotype, still the best way to get along in Paris is to behave exemplarily, like someone who is bien èlevè (well-educated). It will be very easy to get around the city".
The vulgar exterior of the Parisians will evaporate quickly if you introduce basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly with ash, ash and ash trees, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptionally wide variety of plant communities, due to its diverse microclimates, soil types and water levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the moose, the wildcat and the giant squid can be found there, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and must also cover their shoulders.
Most convents do provide blankets for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same spirit, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This too can be asked from the supply at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Moorish cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Middle East, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A popular and simple dinner, especially during the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available additives such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns, including the word sie in the sense of you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence".
It's an important way to distinguish between a number of verbs and a number of nouns.
This is arguably easier to read, although the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used as a noun complicates the writing a bit.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, because the pitch changes with the traffic that follows them.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: stealthily means expensive, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy and usually consistent grammar.
So reading this basic grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand expressions.
Of course, for someone who knows a Romanian language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a limited knowledge of Spanish may be quick to conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that there is no need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories today are generally obsolete, and have survived as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as nami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century C.E.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor hosted cherry blossom parties for himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial court.
"Plants look their best in a natural environment, "so they refrained from picking even one flower".

Many of the customs associated with Christmas have been adopted by atheists in Christian lands and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the night of Easter without sleeping in an exposed spot in order to watch the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it's very possible that it's a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
More traditional churches in many cases hold Easter Sunday candlelight vigils on the Saturday of Easter weekend, and congregations tend to break out in celebration at exactly midnight for the feast of the Resurrection of Jesus.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived here by swimming, flying or flooding.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in the Galapagos, many mammals have been brought to the island, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the North or South Pole in winter, you'll experience a polar night, which means that the sun never rises above the horizon.
This gives a good chance to see the Northern Lights, as the skies will be more or less dark throughout the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is usually not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that of ordinary Westerners.
Suits are standard business attire, and co-workers call each other by their last names or by their job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, and emphasize team effort instead of giving praise for individual accomplishments.
