This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also reports details that could not be provided by fossils  such as color and three-dimensional imagery.
Scientists claim that the animal's plumage was brownish-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed sting, called a rachis, but have other features of the feathers - teeth and beards - researchers have concluded that the rachis probably evolved much later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or beauty, and the researchers suggest that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than feathers to be plucked.
The researchers suggested that although this was a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen showed adult plumage rather than the plumage of a baby.
A car bomb exploded outside a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star, which is associated with the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the changes in the magnetic field.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate the observation of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in a galaxy is arranged around the galaxy in a sort of halo and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally done without the use of high technology: voters go in one by one and put a pre-printed piece of paper with their candidate's name on it in an envelope.
After the officials have certified the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and puts his signature on the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict in encrypting the process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting, and no envelopes are added except those that are put in by duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each stage of the process. Evening votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, with certain procedures being followed.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Clinic in Cambridge.
Adekoya was brought before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the testimony of any witness could be contested as her photo has been published frequently.
In other parts of the UK, this is common practice, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of the photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are clearly taking a dangerous path by circulating photos and other data of suspicious individuals".
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for prosecuting the case, told reporters that it would not provide any further comment, at least until the indictment is filed.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the conflict over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics likely covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands to maintain a military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
The hunters in the auxiliary pest control had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the hunt was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the UNOPS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (ASSA), qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation for the NDP, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received proper safety instruction and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC).
This is the fifth Martelli Provisional Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous TVC as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the large-scale protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been delayed since 2011.
There were about 60 reported cases of overheating of faulty iPods, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 emergencies involving these devices.
Last week, the IETF announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "a great disappointment".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (about 9:19 p.m. on Friday in Greenwich).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six hostages are now reported dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and took a job at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of the hormone accelerated the embryonic development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that state investigators seized two onboard black boxes on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died in the night two months. Quite unique as she is. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "The Moon was as excited as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
From 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of the reign of Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
If one looks at the strong responses to the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and take part in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, doubts were raised about his fitness.
He could not take painkillers, since they are forbidden during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest prime number known to date.
Some people confirmed the discovery using various gadgets and software by early February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water and organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, because comets have been colliding with Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political babble and stupidity".
Rumor has it he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen  is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will enable aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the more outdated ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with maximum accuracy and provide pilots with detailed information.
No additional transport is run and no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and car parking and interchange car parks will not be available on the surface.
Concerns over the lack of transportation made the team consider holding the game behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process would take much longer due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's frog, Geospis fortes, and the migratory cactus frog, Geospis coniorostris.
Gold can be given many different shapes. It can be rolled up into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a fine wire that can be twisted and braided, or it can be hammered into a ball, or it can be rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make an indicator using the juice of the red clover.
The juice of the cappuccino changes color depending on how acidic or basic (false) the chemical is.
The acidity level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The  hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders by turning them in a bowl, then with clean wet hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, providing a strange sensation and forming a shell-like structure.
A toilet connected to an elaborate sewerage network was in almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
Remnants of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were kept together in mixed companies.
When you're making a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back.
A satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light and what we see.
You need a solid rocket at least 100 feet high to get a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing it's done for us is it's made it possible for us to transport ourselves much easier and much faster.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below are larger numbers of medium-sized cats that feed on medium prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on larger small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of the niche  the special position each cat occupies and which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, and live in large groups called pride.
The pride consists of one to three adult male relatives, as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behave much like wolf or dog packs - animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and equally dangerous to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can push up (though not very well), swim, jump for long distances, and punch five times as hard as a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group (the Panther family) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's full-headed roar, but more like a confused roar.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and trace their prey by scent, seeking their scent on the ground.
They have night vision, which gives them excellent vision in the dark, and they also move very quietly, hunting their prey by hiding in their surroundings, then jumping out at them unexpectedly.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to another island and thus cannot easily return), they can often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
In this new environment, different resources and different rivals, so the new species will need to develop new traits or become a stronger rival than it was before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all -- they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, these two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable and extremely important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans expel (that is, exhale).
Plants cook food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
The mosasaur was a top-order predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were pierced by over 70 razor-sharp teeth along with their extra set of upper jaw teeth, meaning that no one who got in its way would be able to escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a tongue, that his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe he was even a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that fell into the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrex could not compete with it.
The Romans ate mostly what we know, but they also had their own strange and unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, slugs, and a rodent called a wolf.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed communal banquets, where they rested on their sides while eating.
Ancient Romans could not have included in their diet the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each god, which was considered the home of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
In each temple, the temple courtyard was open, and then the inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of temples and were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were no longer so important.
Most of the life of this Jewish family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyards; shops were the usual open stalls facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The Canaanite lands were not rich in forests, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Old Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Nation, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words "Original of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
There is no information about its author, but it is known that at the beginning of its existence the document (it measures 293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was kept in a folded state.
Thus, it is quite possible that the record was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy, who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, and this landing was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the "France qui se bat" movement liberated the south of France and marched on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture of a significant group of people who live and work together, i.e. societies.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", meaning "civil", which is related to the Latin words "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also determines the size of society in some way.
City-states can be seen as the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint, and even distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, so they are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time  Congress was its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the authority to impose taxes, and because of the lack of a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state bodies, which often failed to cooperate in the enforcement of all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before their amendment, and the states did not take the central authority so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions, along with Germany national football team.
Sports such as football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing are well-known.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is  Honsh≈´), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" because of the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
The origins of Taiwan go back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing past recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a branch in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Wiccans.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common still photographic image format is  35 mm, which was the main format at the end of the analogue film era.
Today, it's still being made, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit off the beaten path, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APIES family of formats) equal or are very close to this ratio.
The often used and derided rule of thirds  is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
According to him, the most effective place to place the main object is the intersection of the lines that divide the raster into three thirds vertically and horizontally (see Example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity held the European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should combat suffering and poverty, and the church's funds are designed to do just that.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether the church had really followed this postulate.
Shortly after the sudden onset of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, and although the blockade violated generally accepted international legal norms, codified by several international treaties over the last two centuries, it cut off vital military and civilian supply routes.
Britain mined minerals in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Realizing the horrors and cruelty of war during World War I, the nations were determined to prevent such a thing from happening again.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States of America to apply for a position with Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Butchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were depicted in a unique way; each stage of the country's development was each ruling family becoming a prominent dynasty.
In addition, there was a volatile age of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Sanjo Period, which lasted 60 years between the Jin and Han dynasties.
During this time, there were bitter wars between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history  thousands of people died in battles for the throne in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state is the property of the people rather than of a single individual ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all willing men, giving the most ambitious and talented the opportunity to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they were now based on quality.
The French Revolution also inspired many representatives of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life, and he often visited the cave that became known as "Hira", on Mount Nur (the light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived to our day, gives a very vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually quite difficult to find, even if you know it exists, and when you get to the cave, you're completely isolated.
You can see nothing but a clear, beautiful sky above and many mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that has survived to the present day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramids built to honor a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Cheops), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
A "upward" notation looks like a "V" and a "downward" notation looks like a bracket or a square without a bottom.
Up means you have to start at the head and push the lever, and down means you have to start at the pegs (where your hand is holding the lever) and pull the lever.
The upward movement of the strings usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the strings is louder and more forceful.
Feel free to add your own pencil markings, but note that printed markings for stringed instruments have a meaning, so they usually need to be taken into account.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of women from the marketplace drove the disgusted King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, from Versailles and forced them to return to Paris.
In a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a mob of noisy and threatening people to the king and queen.
The yoke forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the gang waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The military expenditures of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay back taxes to the US colonial regime to pay a significant portion of the costs and interest on loans placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, become the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the Order.
The era when these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The Classical Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism  is a concept that actually encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or technological imperative to the idea that human destiny is strictly dictated by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology as such follows a path that is largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are more inevitable than socially conditioned.
For example, someone may argue that a machine necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically unviable for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed that allow for a reduction in the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare methods for treating bodily injuries.
Romanticism carried within it a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and these, while in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is famous for being an epicenter of luxury, which began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
In the 12th century, its position deteriorated mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress of the inhabitants of the east was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25-30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of that time was the Crusades, which led to the use of buttons to secure clothing.
Non-commodity agriculture  Agriculture whose purpose is to grow enough food to meet the needs of the owner and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that uses prepared seeds from local plants in a given ecoregion in combination with seed mixing and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced organic farming, and this still persists in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to gain a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be defined by age, ethnicity, social class, place of residence, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their affiliation through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion items, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to take a few stories of poor children who grew up in neglect, misery or intentional cruelty, and were not socialized as adults.
Such children are called "jungle children" or savages, and are often held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents abandon children at will because of their disapproval of the severe mental or physical disabilities of the latter.
It may be that the feral children were abused or seriously injured before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some were said to have been raised by animals; others were said to have lived in the wild alone.
An uncivilized child raised by animals behaves almost the same (within physical limits) as the corresponding caring animals, for example, treating people with fear or indifference.
And while design technology is supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a help provided to individuals who are learning new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher acts as the layout, like a little human-safe in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in software are designed to ask, suggest, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to learn on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up without care, attention, and education, but they do.
We feel that the foster care system should be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system includes safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster home is supposed to provide everything that they lack in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines both mass and personal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and enjoyment.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as significant motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Egme and McCord (1998) when they studied audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions  facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out that people who are unable to understand language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately determine sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have such abilities in interpreting human behavior.
Research in the 20th century revealed that there are two types of genotypic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of variations that are expressed.
Segregation and recombination change the variation between the two reserves with each generation.
For primates with a digestive system like ours, it is difficult to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant resources in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences - increased depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and beans, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only well digested but also provide a significant amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all of these things, it shouldn't be surprising that our own ancestors were solving the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during a normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed at the other end of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking large amounts of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces you to sleep through to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is the exact opposite of the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive life force is available, and every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of achieving enlightenment, and the only thing that can stop us from achieving it is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Overall, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's made up of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With the help of Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened from yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deities, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war, the conflicts of systems, processes and cultures led to these countries clashing.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, leading to the beginning of the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and it involved real-life battles between the armies of nations on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian beachhead.
However, these plans lost their relevance almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Rzeszko, the Non-Aggression Pact between the USSR and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient means of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time creating obstacles to your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help the British.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using submarines as its main means of transport, tried to stop the movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that moved over hills and other pastures, and were tended by goatherds, often children or teenagers, better known as shepherds.
The causeway was built in England as early as the 16th century.
And although the paved roads were essentially two parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses working on them to develop higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
Slabs were introduced to hold tracks in place early on, but it was gradually realised that tracks would be more effective if iron reinforcements were placed on top of them.
This became common practice, although iron caused more wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and the first all-iron rails appeared in 1767.
The first known movement was walking, people started walking upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright, as they normally do.
Bipedalism is found in fossil Australopithecus remains from 4.2 to 3.9 million years old, although sahelanthrops may have started walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it is merely a symptomatic treatment, but if we are not looking for a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become greater because of human overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press located a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Danlep Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
It is now known that the 25 Dunlap posters are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
Their feet have scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all computers in use today are powered by information encoded in binary numbers.
In a binary number system, there can only be one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and in computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not show up immediately, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to diagnose right away.
The first sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open jar of a medication or a toxic household chemical.
Read the label for specific first aid recommendations for this particular poison.
Formally, entomologists describe this group of insects as beetles.
This term reflects a centuries-old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and cone beetles are nesting insects, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged people as well as younger people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Such parents may decide to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works, and that's really what drives most of the scientific research.
Although it's not just experimentation, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and observing also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms that are not simply responses to external periodic factors are found in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks  are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of the cycle running freely even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment became one of the main hypotheses in the question of whether DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or the bacteriophage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material and whether the grafted cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including the plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about ecosystems.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo, as well as gaining new information about them.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplaces, and other people who work in the places they have just left drive by.
In this dynamic transportation back and forth, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Now science notes that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone lives in a community and uses public transportation, yet few complain about it.
You don't hear that in developed countries, complaints about the quality of the water or the collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and failures every day? Is it because transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow  is the determination of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because it is impossible to predict the behavior of a driver with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent way; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical sequence, and may have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent the flow of transport, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and maintenance of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This opens up a wider range of small places for them to hide from predators.
Now the only insects that can't fold their wings are the butterflies and the monotremes.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed it to be correct, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems rational, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it holds eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes measuring 6 miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in either size or technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the structures of their predecessors, which were by then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800 people, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and also the least populous.
In its legislation and official communication, the Vatican uses Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily communication for most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in their native form, and are quite easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mostly a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that will include nonmetallic elements, such as carbon in small amounts.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of these particles could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil has been a good friend to many since its invention.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil's status and use were diminished.
People now type messages on a computer screen without having to go near a shredder.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like when something new is invented.
The way an atomic bomb works is that it takes energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart upwards, and splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy back.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the top layer of the moon is called the crust.
The lunar crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the moonlit seas and thicker under the high mountains.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner, and the lava was easier to get to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people tick or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been adopted by them in the process of adulthood.
These theories cover certain people and what makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment make or don't make them do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when managers start managing their former colleagues: On the one hand, they try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, allocating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognized personality who feels that they have to change everything that the team has done and do it their own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact with their immediate real-world group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet across time zones, which may be incomprehensible to their local supervisors.
The presence of a true "invisible collective" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual collective.
The "invisible team" is a management group to which all members report. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the process of implementing an organizational learning approach that takes so much time?
When all available resources are used efficiently across functional departments of the organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovation process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities, and in doing so, it narrows the field of research and makes it more precise.
Scientists are encouraged by the link between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important subdivision of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
In AI research, machines are forced to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and design, the ability to respond to customer assessments and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things became separate disciplines focused on solving real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into several applications related to home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of any classroom, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual classroom tours, where students can look at museum artifacts or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
A virtual tour  is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trip to the state capital; the website is rebuilt each year, but older versions of it are kept online as an album.
Blogging can also help improve a student's writing skills.While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "provokes students to a better awareness of the world around them".[23] The need to satisfy the interest of the audience motivates students to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging  is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn well outside of the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials from the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of others' articles, as well as outline their own views on individual issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's beautiful bilingual capital, is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and further north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more are highlighting in Ontario what outsiders think is the quintessential Canadian thing.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wildlife.
A population comparison that may surprise many: The United States has more African Americans than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest, and is a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it took root strongly in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around Europe's Cape of Good Hope to India.
It is bordered on the north by the Sahel region, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All women travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also wise to wear a high heel (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can result in what you may consider harassment, and it's not uncommon for you to be followed, grabbed by the hand, and so on.
Say no to men firmly, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not normal!).
The present town of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese completely destroyed it and then rebuilt and named Casa Branca, and in 1755 after an earthquake abandoned it.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Darou-i-Badia, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name of Casablanca.
Casablanca  is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east next to Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, any travel outside Goma should be informed of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
It is also the base for the climb of Mount Nyiragongo and one of Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla treks.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because of this, and the relative inaccessibility of the name, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though it has an airport and attracts tourists with its history.
In 1990 it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS reporting of Henry Louis Gates' Wonder of the African World.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country because it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres (19,500 sq mi) and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major landmarks and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, visitors are charged a daily fee for security and admission.
It may also be beneficial for someone to buy a Wild Card, which entitles him to enter some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place of special interest to many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the architectural face of Hong Kong has been compared to the brilliant histogram that is manifested by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the harbor on the opposite side of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated in the built-up area along the north shore.
This is a place that was appropriated by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal strip of mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the inland areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps, for they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer now live in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is recommended that you buy a ticket a few days before the trip.
Most areas are served by the small Japanese "Koster" buses, which are comfortable and durable.
The  route taxi is a quick and convenient way to travel to places located nearby such as Paro (150) and Punakha (200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the Oiapoque River and the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to the town of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guinea.
The bridge is 83 metres (276 ft) high and 378 metres (1,210 ft) long, with two car lanes of 3.50 metres (11.8 ft) wide each.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned to be fully opened in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guaran√≠ were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who sometimes engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups clashed to create Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indians".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest event of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here and at other times of the year.
Please contact the Argentine Polo Association for news on tournaments and ticketing for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and many establishments also accept Stanley credit cards and US dollars.
In remote islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British or United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the Falkland Islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30¬∞C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain falls remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to humans, the wild animals are still wild, so they do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to park management guidelines, keep at least 100 yards [100 m] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
Humble though they may seem, buffalo, deer, moose, bear, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, remember that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so take along and do not cook any smelly yeast, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour became the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and about 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader of the Tupo, Tamaseze Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location between the two harbors, with the most popular being in the three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour area) beaches are on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by mangroves.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Bay, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Helier in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly, sometimes crowded beaches with many shops along the coastline.
The main local beer, "Number One"  is simple but pleasant and refreshing.
You can taste a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines may be better able to withstand transportation.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. The short black  is "espresso", cappuccino is made with bitter cream (not with foam), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are not cheap, but they're delicious.
Many trips to the reef occur year-round, and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay particular attention to danger warnings.
The cube jellyfish are found near beaches and river embankments from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not spend much time in the ocean, their main natural habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to stay once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often work with specific hotels, although you can try booking some other accommodation with them, such as camping.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined airline and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your trip (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should still first go through the travel agency, not directly through the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of music event attendees choose to stay overnight, and for most attendees, this is an important part of the adventure.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get a seat closer to the stage.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has stopped playing, there may be sections at the festival that will play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, be careful about the cabin layout, because traveling through the ice makes a pretty awful noise if you're very close to its source.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a great effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and in the house.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but getting drunk can affect your judgment, so all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and it is not allowed to drive as if on bare asphalt.
During a storm, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck in it.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by water or ice forming on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues unimpeded year-round.
The safari  is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, attracting the attention of many visitors.
The term safari is generally used to refer to a journey by land to marvel at the incredible African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, so standard equipment will allow them to be well viewed.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are fearful, and they are best observed through binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "country walk", "hike safari", or "walk") is a hike of several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in various locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation procedures vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation procedures have not been extended until July 2020  the time the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
A sponge and a washboard can be rented at many hotels, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a sparkler, or you don't like wearing socks with a sparkler, then you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (which can cause sealing, or in extreme cases, propylene).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water takes only a minute; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have problems, consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unknown in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping  is the ability to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such goods as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway is the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, as it often passes through isolated forested wilderness.
If you are unfamiliar with country roads, note that they are dominated by steep slopes, narrow paths, and steep curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is extremely important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, however, the mobile connection is much better than at many other points along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastry is quite good, and Bavarian pastry is quite rich and varied, similar to that of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is quite common: apples are used in baking all year round, and cherries and plums are used in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts, and popular pies often taste especially good with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but tasty pastry, try what is called "Berliner", "Pfannkuchen" or "Krapfen" depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan yogurt is traditionally added to curry; in South India and occasionally in other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is traditionally added.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food  is an umbrella term that encompasses the wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the nation.
But when used without further specification, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now very common throughout the archipelago and offers a wide variety of simply seasoned dishes, among which the predominant flavors are peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of aromatic spices.
The  strings are the supports for the rider's stirrup, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can be dangerous due to the potential for the rider's foot to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may run and pull him off.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a padded and smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Further, some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety device that will cause the saddle to fall off with the belt if the falling rider pulls it behind him.
The Cochamo Valley, with its variety of granite high rises and cliffs, is the main climbing area in Chile, which is also known as the Yosemite of South America.
Climbing involves admiring the breathtaking views from the summits, and climbers from all over the world are constantly laying new routes amid the endless potential of the walls.
Skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding  a popular sport that involves descending a slope covered in snow on skis or snowboards that are attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the major tourist activities, involving many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski vagabonds", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings dating back to 5000 B.C. depict skiers!
Alpine skiing as a sport was introduced no later than the 17th century, and in 1861 the first health ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called backpacking on skis, ski tourism, or ski walks.
This is related to, but does not usually include, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is conducted on steep slopes and requires the use of harder skis and shoes.
Consider the skiing route as a tourist route.
If the conditions are good, you can travel significantly more distances than you would on foot  but it's really rare that you can reach the speed of a cross-country ski without a heavy backpack on well-maintained routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with a large number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean passing visa and passport control multiple times.
However, the Schengen area in this sense acts as one country.
By staying in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't have to get a visa for each of the countries that are part of the Schengen area, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes a manufactured item an antique, although some tax agencies characterize goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition varies depending on geographical location  the age limit in North America, for example, may be lower than in Europe.
Craft items can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Deer hunting is an important source of livelihood for the S√°mi, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important to many who have other professions.
Even traditionally not all Saami engaged in large-scale deer hunting, but lived off fishing, hunting, etc., keeping deer usually as draft animals.
Today, many S√°mi people are employed in modern trade, and tourism in Sapmi, where the S√°mi people live, is a significant source of income.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of these people.
If the country you are about to visit becomes the subject of government travel advisories, this may affect your travel health and non-travel insurance.
You may also want to consult the governments of countries other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face situations that are different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Newsletters present only brief information about the political situation in the country.
The data presented is often superficial, generalized, and very simplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any hazardous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, cause serious social upheaval, or kill people.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and they come in different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all varieties and effects of bad weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water tornadoes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, thunderstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of adverse weather conditions in their area, as they may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
A search of the Internet for the term "Hostile Environment" will likely yield the address of a local company.
Generally, all the issues that are discussed here are covered in much more detail in the course, usually with practical exercises.
Typically, the course lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid training, and sometimes fire training.
Books and magazines that tell stories of survival in the desert are common, but there is little publicity about the war zones.
Tourists planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should be sure to have valid documents with them for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to consider such documents also varies greatly.
Searching at checkpoints has also become more serious in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Reverse currents  are the back-flows from waves that break on the shore, often on a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and there can be a fast current into deep water.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue while trying to swim backwards against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it used to be.
Try to head for a place where you won't be caught in the current again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it may be better to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had no trouble adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a particularly hard time adjusting back to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and have lost some of the customs of your native culture.
When you first moved abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not expect that travelers will have the same patience and understanding when returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most exciting activities for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the silence before the show.
You usually hear the sounds of tourists and merchants all the time, and the history of sound and light is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The pyramids are painted with scenes, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819 and claimed by several countries, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is  King George, with the settlement of Villas Estrellas.
Among others are the islands of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano underlies an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land  is the area in the south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here converge into a plateau and then reemerge, forming the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica: Vinson Massif and Vinson Peak, reaching an altitude of 4,892 m (19,030 ft).
In remote areas, without cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be out in the open with a clear view from the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used on vessels, including cruise ships and expeditions, that require remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider should provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning an academic vacation is travel and study.
This practice is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, studying abroad during your academic leave can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Usually, such educational programs are paid.
Finland  is a great place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on the archipelago and the lakes.
While the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This compares with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is generally a rather unique phenomenon (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most of these notable Baltic Sea cruises are characterized by a long stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend several full days in the historic site, returning to the ship for the night.
When you go ashore only on boat trips, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a grueling experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of; it is no different from the personal fears or disgust that so many people have for other things.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear based on ignorance or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things, and time is often of the essence when it comes to delivering business documents, goods, or parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but in the case of other routes, smaller firms have faced a problem.
If they were to ship by air, some routes would take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to do it quickly was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's your exit.
To fly first or business class, you obviously have to pay a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, get your airline to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: you can usually expect to pay 4 times the standard economy fare for business class and 11 times the first class fare!
In general, on direct flights from point A to point B, there is no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the highest price for the privilege of getting anywhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge a corresponding fee for this.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is  Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million people, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, thriving commercial center, surrounded by a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are interspersed with traditional red-tiled houses, an 18th-century bazaar and ancient mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldorsk offers views of the nearby island of Estuary, as well as an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, some tombs are topped with interesting marble sculptures of doves.
The intriguing village is worth at least a half-hour's walk.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became widely known to foreigners after a full admiration of the review of its splendour written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus is a regular service to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple of the Brothers), the site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are, in effect, visiting a mass grave site, and also a site of tremendous significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived imprisonment here, and even more whose loved ones were killed or worked to death here, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, the solemnity and the respect it deserves, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not tarnish the site by putting markings or graffiti on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to converse in Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, and unplanned outages are reported by an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude, and conceited.
It's just a misconception, but the best way to get around Paris is to behave like a "bien √©lev√©" (well-bred) person.
The Parisian severity will soon disappear if you show a little common respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, pine and spruce and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptional diversity of plant crops due to its different microclimates and soil types, as well as variable altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and deer, as well as many other well-known species, can be found here.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give capes to women who come unprepared, but if you come with your own, especially in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
They can also be borrowed from the storage area at the entrance, but the clothes are not changed after each user, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing these clothes.
The cuisine of Mallorca, like similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa-Amb-Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, next to the word Sie in the sense of you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It may also make reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in the substantive form.
Pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, since most words are pronounced the same way they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation differs depending on the vowels that follow.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, and carro  is a chariot.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally correct grammar.
So, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Needless to say, if you know Romance, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, those who have a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is quite similar to it and does not need to be learned separately.
Today, ancient observatories are generally obsolete and function as museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, and are more accessible than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge objects in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first flowering festivals were held by the supreme emperor in the Imperial Palace for himself and other members of the aristocracy only.
Plants look best in the wild, so resist the temptation to destroy even "just one" plant.
If you visit an officially designated garden, the collection of "samples" will also result in expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally an exceptionally safe place and very easy to navigate, where you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both the heat (always) and the scorching sun (less often when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you plan to take is going to Hebron, not just the nearest Jewish settlement, Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great idea for recreation.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube River or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians worldwide.
It is customary to spend the night of Easter without sleeping in some open place to see the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter service on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and the faithful at the church often begin the celebration with the rising of midnight to mark the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands were brought here either by water or air.
The great distance from the mainland prevented mammals from making the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
After man arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs, appeared.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will discover the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the aurora, as the sky will be more or less dark throughout the day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not a problem, you too can enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The standard business form of clothing is suits, with employees addressing each other by their surname or job title.
Harmony in the work environment is emphasized, and the efforts of the group are valued above personal achievements.
Employees often need to get their supervisor's approval for any decisions, and they are also expected to follow their supervisors' instructions unquestioningly.
