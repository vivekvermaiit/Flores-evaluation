In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this gives us details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were a striped brown at the top and pale or cartenoid on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers  spines and spines  researchers have concluded that the rachis probably arose in a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation and display. The researchers say that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen suggests that it is the feathers of an adult rather than a juvenile.
The researchers noted that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult individual rather than the feathers of a bird.

The work done is mostly theoretical in nature, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be produced by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
By the same principle that the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides and currents, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in much the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is arranged around the galaxy in the form of a halo, and is composed of many tiny particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been very simple in terms of technology: voters go to the polling booth alone and put a printed ballot with the chosen candidate in an envelope.
Once officials confirm the voter's identity, he inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs himself onto the voter list.
France's electoral law very strictly codifies the protocol.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those from duly enumerated and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each part of the process.

Police Superintendent Chanda Shekhar Solanki stated that the frightened appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
A woman has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness evidence could be compromised given that her picture has been published in many media outlets.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observed: 'Journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish images of suspects or anything else.'
The Scottish Public Prosecutor's Office, which has general jurisdiction over criminal prosecution, told reporters that there would be no further comment at least until charges were dropped.
According to leaked information, the document will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-Six-Day War 1967 borders.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian authorities agree that the presence exists for only five years.
The shooters in the complementary pest control action were to be under the strict supervision of the rangers, given that the action was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and a corporation called the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers are employed under the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick Offlin, acting director of park and heritage conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
The new nine-member Electoral Commission (CEP) was sworn in yesterday under Martelly.
It is Martelly's fifth election commission in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the CEP's previous resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Violent protests have sometimes been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been in place since 2011.
Some 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods were reported, leading to a total of six fires, as well as minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry said it was aware of 27 accidents involving such devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "insignificant".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of the elderly lady as she needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to build a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of the hormone would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" containing flight records on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Moona was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. She passed away in the night for two months. Pretty unique in her likeness. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldstein Runnels commented: "Moon was just as weird as me...maybe more so...I love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
At the extreme of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have cast doubt on his fitness.
He was unable to take the pain medication he needed because it is banned at the Olympic Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been the source of water that arrived on Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have collided with the Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There is public talk that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to earlier technologies based on ground-based radar, to enable air traffic controllers to determine the position of an aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport being put on overhead trains will stop at Wembley, and parking lots and 'park and ride' type facilities are not available above ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the teams' fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved over just two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's hare, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus hare, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be worked into thin wire, which can be twisted or braided, or it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to some other metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate pictures in books known as "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of the chemical. You can make an indicator using the juice of red cabbage.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons stripped of electrons (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, moist hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of wrapper.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilet bowls in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of a sewerage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also found. In Roman civilization, toilets were once part of public baths, where men and women were in the same company together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then returns it down almost instantly.
Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere reflects some of the light and images.
Sending a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet high.
The biggest thing the bicycle has done for us is it has made it possible for us to travel much easier and faster.
This brought us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a special job that each cat performs that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of the cats, and they live in large groups known as packs.
The choporis consist of one to three adult males in a litter, compared with up to thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion hounds behave similarly to wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but it is more like a sentence full of sharp, high-pitched words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, including monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if possible, and almost all the animals it hunts are much smaller than the ocelot itself.
Scientists think that ocelots track and seek prey by smell, by smelling the ground they have been on.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they move very quietly. Survivors hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and then heading for their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in an environment different from that in which it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than was previously required.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after several thousand or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We make houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the supreme predator of its day, and they feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set of teeth on a hard jaw, meaning that nothing in its path could escape.
We cannot say for sure, but it may have had a shell-like tongue, fed on turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not have been able to match it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some of their own strange or unusual things to feast on, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a pooh.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich liked to organize banquets at which they would lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted puree.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of that god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to please the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in front of the temple and an inner sanctuary into which only the priests could enter.
At one time, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's daily activities took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery, by that time the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you may think that the treasure map was drawn against the backdrop of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that somewhere in its early days this large parchment document (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1⁄2) was a storage container.
Well, most likely the label was added purely as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was led by the "Visigoth" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had allied themselves with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated the south of France and marched on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in cooperation, i.e., a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines the size of a community.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable diffusion.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and so are often not recognized as true civilizations.
While fighting for independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Treaty of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all their legal documents.
Nor did he have any authority to overturn tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Unanimous approval from all the states was necessary before members could be changed, and the states were so easily swayed by the central administration that their representatives were often absent from the meetings.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, has been the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called an archipelago on geographical displays.
Taiwan's origins go back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilja Formos, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning the transformation of aboriginal grain-producing practices, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which gave Japan sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio inherited the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide, and 24 mm high.
The ratio of dimensions of this format is thought to be 3:2 (divided by 12 to get the simplest ratio in the form of a whole number).
Many common formats (say the APS family of formats) are equal to or nearly approximate this size.
The often abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple instruction that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the picture.
It states that the most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, began to be censored.
For thousands of years, the Christian religion bound the nations of Europe together, despite differences in language and customs.
With its inexhaustible power, it influenced everyone, from kings to common men.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the flow of vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire stretches of ocean, thus endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the responses to this tactic were limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In order to accept a job with the Edison Company of New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his boss at his previous job) intended for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each period of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between each dynasty, with the most famous of all being the Three Kingdoms period that lasted sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there was intense warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in a battle for the throne in the huge palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
Also after the revolution, occupations were opened to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, for instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues that were outside of his ordinary life. He went out often to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (the light).
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is difficult to find, even if one knows it exists.
Nothing is to be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of a number of large pyramidal structures that pay homage to the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The Uz arc sign looks like a V, and the Niz arc sign looks like a staple or a square missing the bottom side.
Up means you should start from the top and push the whistle, while Down means you should start from the frog's head (where your hand holds the whistle) and pull the whistle.
Raising the bellows usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering the bellows produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Feel free to pencil in your markings, but remember that the printed markings of the cymbals are there for a musical reason, and they should usually be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to retreat to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women from the market.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The mob ordered the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point a member of the entourage waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino citizens themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the costs and interest on the securities circulated by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were the main gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The high medieval period was preceded by the High Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, officially ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development itself goes by a path that is beyond cultural and political influences and that in turn technology has its "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Still, the national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a considerable dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and in time customs and cultures related to that geography would emerge, and these, in accordance with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned, bringing gifts, such as silk and spices, that were worth more than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Cardiff to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowing of the communication channels, the styles in the West could be lagging behind by some 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of the era as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Consumer agriculture is agriculture that is conducted to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Consumer agriculture is a simple, often organic system, that uses preserved seeds, native to a given ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were self-employed, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be particular because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often designate their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, which includes fashion, mannerism, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to some sad cases of children who, because of neglect, accident, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some feral children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children occurs as a result of parents' refusal to accept the child's serious intellectual and physical disabilities.
The children she admired may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children display behavior (within physical limits) that almost entirely resembles the behavior of those animals that have cared for them, such as their fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, learning through the Scala system goes a step further.
Metacognitive support is not a learning method, but rather a support by which support is provided to individuals, with help going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is actually a kind of a supporter, but also a little human-clutch in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are an integral part of the software and should review, encourage and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to implement themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet it does.
We view the foster-family system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster-family system should provide a secure home, caring caregivers, continuing education, and reliable health care.
Family placement of children should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usage and access to content.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as important purposes of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Aimee and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "maintained relationships" as new motivational aspects when researching audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that if you correctly interpret microexpressions, you can tell if a person is lying.
In his work The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even thinks that animals such as domestic dogs may have such abilities in understanding human behavior.
Research in the 20th century revealed that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unseen.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes the expressed variation from the stock.
Segregation and recombination affect the constant mixing of variations between the two funds in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a human-like digestive tract has difficulty meeting its needs for amino acids from the plant sources at its disposal.
Even if this is not done, serious consequences may result: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The plant resources that were most easily accessed were the proteins available in the leaves and legumes, but primates like us have a hard time digesting them if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, egg) are not only easily digested but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished with a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you reset the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which causes a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but these have been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of a kundalini of yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga, and the visualization of the various deities cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures led to the two countries becoming confused.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
Planned to last 40 years, the struggle would be a straightforward one, through conflicts of smaller countries representing the interests of larger military powers, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern areas of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Trans-oceanic shipping is arguably the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large amounts of goods across the ocean.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most notable, recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to smuggle men and weapons across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goats that were mostly children or young, similar to the more familiar shepherds.
Wagon tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horse-drawn carriages to reach higher speeds and to pull greater loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Railroad sleepers were introduced fairly early to hold rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
This became standard practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the car.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first railway track was made of solid iron.
The first known form of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is customary.
The improvement in bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is symptomatic, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and put it out.
Clearly, the world has changed a great deal as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have been made worse by overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away, to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Danlaup's pages".
John Nixon first publicly read this document on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops on July 9 in New York, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 The Dunlap Letters, as they are still known, are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on handwriting information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open package of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient familiarity with cockroaches, insects very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and common cockroaches are long-term parental species, adapted to life in the litter or home of a host.
Across the United States, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study showed that women are twice as likely to have MS symptoms as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can be the child's parent.
The main task of science is to understand the way the world works using the scientific method, which actually governs most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were respected.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that are not simply responses to periodic shifts in external influences have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of rotation of free running, even if there are no external signs.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments that labeled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material that is affected, and whether the cells affected are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in the bacillus cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna of the wild.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural places by car to go to their workplaces, mingling with those whose workplaces are located right where they left.
In this dynamic transportation process, all are somehow connected and support a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this carbon-intensive economy has moved the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed lands, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and make daily mistakes? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonable consistent range; therefore traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of the facilities on the road.
Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a greater choice of various small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot bend their wings are the fairy's hornets and water lilies.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus had said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This sounds reasonable, since it does not feel as if the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on earth, carrying 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its mestimic width of six miles.
A whopping 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, by then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous country.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times, since they can be found in nature in their original form and can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of only one or a few of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although he also theorized that these were transformed into new substances, to form what we see.
Alloy is actually a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and there are metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that consist of small amounts of nonmetals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sadly, when new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and used less.
People now type messages on a computer screen without ever having been near a cutter.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when it encounters something new.
The physics bomb works by taking energy to assemble a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
This is similar to pushing a heavy cart down a hill, and the re-cracking of the core releases a certain amount of energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The moon's surface is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar sea, and thicker under the hills.
The moon's crust may be thinner than the surface, so there may be more lunar seas on the near side.
Content theories are geared towards finding out what motivates people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they matured into adults.
These theories study what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two forms of behavior can arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues: At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything that team has done and make it his own.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams should meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that local management would not have an understanding of.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports.
One of the goals for applying the concept of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can come to the fore.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities, thereby narrowing the field of research and making it much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the claims of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI draws a strong connotation towards science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military purposes, as they are embedded in several home computers and video game software applications.
Often the teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in their class.
Virtual excursion sharing is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital, each year the web page is redesigned, but older versions are kept online so that they can serve as an album.
While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make an effort to correct the writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "encourages students to become more resourceful about the world around them". The need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to materials from the Internet, students can define their own views in the context of others' texts, as well as express their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it has a whole host of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven of pristine natural beauty in Muskoka and beyond.
All of this further highlights Ontario as something that foreigners consider to be essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely accepted on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All passengers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to follow them, hold their hand, and so forth.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, it is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and even the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru el-Badia, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name of Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of dranguli, but all of these are intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
Goma was destroyed in 2002 in the Nyiragongo lava flows, which clogged most of the city streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is fairly safe, any visits outside Goma should be well researched to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
This city is also the base from which the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano begins, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle-style taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a shorter ride.
Because of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
Threatened by desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stations during the filming of "The Wonder of the African World", on PBS.
This city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the state, as it has more of an Arab than African flavor.
Kruger National Park (NPK) is located northeast of South Africa and along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which contains a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the main attraction of South Africa's national parks (JANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily fees for conservation and park entry.
Consider also the purchase of a wild card, which allows entry into certain South African parks or all of the national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a glittering ribbon chart that becomes apparent with the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon coast on the opposite side.
Most of the urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This place was taken over by British colonists, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the backwaters of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps  they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3850 km2, of which one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 peacocks in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakarta/Bumnang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing taxis is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges del Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 273 feet (83 m), and the bridge is 1,291 feet (378 m) long and has two lanes that are 11 feet (3.5 m) wide.
The vertical opening under the bridge is 15 metres (50 ft) in size. Construction was completed in August 2011 but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully put into use in September 2017, when the completion of the customs posts on the Brazilian side is expected.
The Gurú were the most important indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in self-sustaining agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycura and the Payagüas, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly called the "Diva Province of the Indies", Paraguay was founded in the 16th century as a result of Spanish conquistadors' encounters with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and swords can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For all tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association (Asociación Argentina de Polo).
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands Pound (FRF) whose value is set equivalent to the value of one British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across the street from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
In remote islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British currency and United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the island, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Because Montevidéu is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; in the summer months, temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined give a feeling of being much colder than the thermometer says.
There are no distinct wet and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild is still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, keep at least 100 yards [100 yards] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 yards] from all other wildlife!
Despite their appearance, bison, North American and European moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep proper distance.
Additionally, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and has officially held the title of the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval skirmish in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with nearly two hundred American and German lives lost.
During the independence struggle in the organization of the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme chieftain Tupua Tamassés Lealófiyo III.
Since Auckland extends over two harbours, there are many beaches.
The North Shore (in the North Port area) beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe bathing areas, and most of them are also cold with trees buzzing.
Tamaki Drive beaches are in the Waitematā Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a wide range of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer Broj jedan is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines that are well tasted, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for the journey.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
To Australians, coffee is a foreign term: a white double espresso with milk; a short black is an espresso; a cappuccino comes highly poured with a shot (not foam); and tea is served without milk.
The fruit juices are expensive, but they are exceptional.
Numerous trips to the reef are organized throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of the above causes are rare on the reef.
Still, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Quarter-fin jellyfish appear near the beach and near the mouth of the river from October to April north of the town in 1770.
Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim as far away from you as possible.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through them.
Travel agents usually offer arrangements that include breakfast, provided transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of a flight and a hotel arrangement.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or can obtain other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (e.g. visa).
Any supplement or request should first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to secure a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may have stopped, there may be parts of the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during winter, check the location of the hut, since passing through the ice causes quite awful sounds for those most affected.
Cruise to St. Petersburg includes time spent in the city.
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money spent by visitors.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them in the building.
In some places alcoholic beverages are served on a house-charge, but drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning a drive over high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the signal is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow may fall in a very short time to cause you to get stuck.
Snowshoes, fog, or ice on the windows of vehicles can also limit visibility.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the experience for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to overland journeys in which you can see the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars slowly, so standard equipment allows for good eyesight.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you will be better able to observe them with your eyes open.
A walking safari (also called a "nature walk", "walking safari", or "walking tour") consists of a hike, lasting a couple of hours or a couple of days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the delay was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
The expected price of most event tickets will range from 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with the typical ticket price being around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer to rent ironing boards and ironing boards, even if you do not have them in your room.
If an ashtray is not available, or if you do not like to wear ashtray socks, then you may try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too warm (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, to freezing).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective than certain treatments.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying water from reputable companies in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar in their native regions.
Harmful pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, widespread poisoning, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force usually do not turn into pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save decent amounts of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, as it often passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and later sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict observance is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone network is much stronger here than along many other sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, much like those from its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cake is common, with apples baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called berliner, fancuchen, or kraffen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
But when used without additional qualifiers, the term usually denotes food originating in the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine contains a rich array of simply spiced dishes, among which are the predominant flavours preferred by the Javanese such as peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The reins are the supports for the rider's feet that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can pose a safety problem due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he may be pulled out if the horse continues to run.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow heel.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety barriers that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if pulled by the rider at the moment of falling.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks, breathtaking views are provided, and climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the unseen potentials of the mountainside.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending down a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as skiers' spooks, plan entire vacations spent skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski mountaineering: This activity is often called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to, but does not usually include, ski touring or alpine-style mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much tighter skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as being similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover a little more distance than by walking  but you will very rarely reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy bag on the paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to pass through visa and passport controls more than once.
In this respect, however, the Schengen Area functions much like a single state.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to pass through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas separately for each of the Schengen member states, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition by which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define products over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places such as North America relative to Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
Irvas farming is important to the life of the Lapons, and the culture of trade is also important to many who are engaged in other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were largely devoted to raising irvas, but lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and the irvas were mainly used for drawing and carrying loads.
Today, many Lapons are engaged in modern crafts, and tourism is a major source of income in Lapland, a region in the Lapland region.
Although common, especially outside the Roma community, the word Gypsy is often considered offensive because it arouses negative stereotypes and wrong conclusions about the Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel recommendations, it may affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to listen to the advice of the governments of other countries, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios than Europeans or Arabs.
The reports are just brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified in comparison with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or result in loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include lightning storms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of bad weather in the area where they are, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wants to travel to a country that might be called a war zone would have to undergo professional training beforehand.
If you type "hostile environment course" into an Internet search, you will likely get the address of a local company.
The course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, mostly with practical experience.
The course will usually last 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes training in the use of weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo sex-change surgery abroad should check that they are carrying valid documents for repatriation.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not identify a person as a gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to abide by these documents varies equally.
Security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Prerequisite transgender people should not expect to be let through scanners with untouched privacy and dignity.
The cut currents represent the backflow of waves that break away from the beach, often present on a reef or similar places.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper parts and there can be created fast currents to deep water.
Most deaths are due to fatigue while attempting to swim upstream, which may be unfeasible.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it is otherwise.
Try to aim somewhere where you will not be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you are spotted, you may wish to wait to be rescued.
Returning shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you returned home after living abroad, you adapted to a new culture and lost some of your customs from your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding with you, knowing that travelers in a new country must adjust.
People may not expect that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children to do here.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases there, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here the peninsula mountains merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of Ellsworth Mountain, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Vinson reaching 4,892 m (16,030 ft).
In remote areas where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a cell phone, since to make a call, you must be out in the open and have your satellite in clear view.
This service is often used for travel by ship, including yacht, as well as for expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year off is to travel and study.
This is especially popular with those finishing school, as it allows them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can improve the prospects for progressing to higher education in one's home country.
There is usually a tuition fee to enroll in some of these educational programs.
Finland is a great sailing destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You do not need a yacht in the archipelago and on the lakes.
While the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and then return and sleep on the ship for the night.
If you go to the coast only as part of boat trips, you do not need a special visa (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and aversions about other things that so many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help them to overcome fear based on the unknown or the inability to control events.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, cargo, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes larger companies have their own planes, but for some other routes or for smaller firms it was a problem.
If they sent the goods by air freight, it may have taken days on some routes to clear customs and customs clearance.
The only way to get through faster was to send the baggage as checked. Airline regulations will not allow them to send the baggage without passengers, where you enter the story.
An obvious way to fly first or business class is to set aside a hefty sum for the privilege (or, better yet, to get the company you work for to do it for you).
This is not cheap, however: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times as much as a standard economy ticket for business, and eleven times as much for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point even in asking for discounts for business seats and first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
This conflict resulted in the creation in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century bazaar, and old mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Estroy, and it has an unusual octagonal church.
In the church's gateway, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some tombs.
It is worth setting aside half an hour to walk through the intriguing village.
To the north and in close proximity is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to outsiders after a glorious tale of its wonders was recorded by Lord Byron.
The 403 Scout-turb bus travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a place known worldwide by the indications of the Virgin Mary.
Please note that you are visiting a place of mass graves, as well as a place of almost incalculable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their stay here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
We ask that you treat this place with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves.
Do not ruin the place by making markings or by cutting graffiti on objects.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, since it is established by law as the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular notifications in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are automatically announced in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, unkind, and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave nicely - like someone who is bien élevé (well-behaved).
The unkindness of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an extremely wide range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, differing soils, and varying levels of elevation.
This area is also home to an extremely large number of different species of animals and birds.
Rare animal species, including brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and great crested newt, as well as many more endemic species, can be found here
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knees, as well as cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have provided dresses for women who have arrived unprepared, but if you bring your own dress, especially one with bright colors, you will conjure a smile on the monk or nun's face at the entrance.
By the same rule, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can borrow these from the storefront, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and generally uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie, which stands for the word Vi, are always written with a capital initial, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said to facilitate reading, although writing is a bit complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or a preposition is used in the form of a pronoun.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The basic letters to pay attention to are c and d, since their pronunciation varies depending on the accompanying consonant.
Also, try to pronounce r and r differently: kar means dear, while karro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and generally regular grammar.
Thus, reading this grammar book would help you to learn much about Persian grammar and to understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you speak some Romance languages, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and exist as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they can usually be found in cities or on campuses, where they were more readily available than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebration was organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
The plants look best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the challenge of removing at least one sample.
If you are visiting a formal garden, you will also be thrown out by collecting "samples", and that without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and is very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything on arrival.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, whichever is less).
A couple of buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron itself, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
River routes in the interior can be a good basis for planning a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to interesting places on the Danube or taking a boat ride along the Irie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-Christians in Christendom and by non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition of spending the night of the resurrection without sleeping, in an open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this ritual of spring and fertility predates Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold a resurrection vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, while communities often go out with a celebration as soon as it is midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the mainland prevented mammals from traveling, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas during winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, since the sky will be dimmer and darker throughout the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, and you will be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is hierarchical and more formal than what Westerners may be used to.
The suits are business attire, and coworkers address each other by surname or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than individual accomplishments.
Often, workers must seek the approval of their superiors for every decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
