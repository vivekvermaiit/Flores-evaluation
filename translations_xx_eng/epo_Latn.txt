At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the shopping television channel QVC.
Furthermore, Ring resolved a lawsuit with the competing security company ADT Corporation.
Although one experimental vaccine appears capable of reducing the Ebola mortality rate, so far no treatment has clearly proven effective for curing the existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially appeared promising in the field, but formal studies indicate that it is less useful than desired in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a benchmark to compare three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes that the Olympic family certainly needs the development of a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of UOK that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, can be better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than by being deprived of certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how mistreatment of the scale, so bravely described by the survivors of Larry Nassar, could remain unnoticed for so long, and welcomes any necessary and adequate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal — to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible, so that athletes may pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot give, such as color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown with pale or carotenoid-colored lower edges.
The discovery also provides understanding about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but do have other features of feathers—branches and barbs—the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably a later evolutionary achievement than those other features.
Based on the structure of the feathers, it is assumed that they were not used for flight, but more likely for thermoregulation or display. The researchers speculated that the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile down, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur.

They found that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system turned out to be driven by nothing other than their brightness and their rotation.
The brightness and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a star, which relates to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is regarding magnetic inversions.

He added that "they should not, however, be asked to take on duties which exceed their stage of development, responsibility, or ability."
The Iraq Study Group presented its report at 12:00 GMT today.
It warns: No one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq now will stop sectarian fighting, growing violence, or a slide into chaos.
The Report begins with a call for an open debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.
The report heavily criticizes almost every aspect of the current policy of the executive regarding Iraq and urges an immediate change of direction.
The first among its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative must be undertaken by the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interferences and to reestablish diplomatic relations with its neighbors.
Current senator and former First Lady of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced her candidacy for the presidential post last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for the presidency at the Teatro Argentino, the same place where she began her campaign to be elected to the Senate in 2005, as a member of the delegation from the province of Buenos Aires.
The debate was caused by discord over the expenses for rescue and reconstruction following Hurricane Katrina, which some fiscal conservatives humorously nicknamed the "New Orleans Affair of Bush."
Liberal criticism of the reconstruction efforts focused on the awarding of reconstruction contracts to supposed outsiders from Washington.

The work done was mostly theoretical, however a program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team looked for the effect that the tidal forces would cause between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that the darkest matter around a galaxy surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo and consists of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the power plant.
Local authorities are warning residents near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners, and not to drink tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very much troublesome and alarming because it has a very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have been infected by the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two of them are healthcare workers from the hospital.
During one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of tuberculosis patients seems to be small; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their temperature behavior is not as stable as in the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it matches those that are deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a technologically simple experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place the pre-printed paper with the name of their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voters' list.
The French electoral law fairly strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes before the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those of orderly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each phase of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under careful supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting category, with a total run time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place finisher, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place winner, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant to Chief Inspector D K Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver received serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since remained in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court, accused of the murder of his son.
She is being detained awaiting official charges and trial, but any deposition by a witness may be influenced because her image has been widely publicized.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish law operates differently, and courts view the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists really seem to be approaching a dangerous line if they publish photos or other details about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, explained to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution is brought forward.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over boundaries that Palestine wants based on the borders before the Middle East war of the year 1967.
Other relevant issues, reportedly, will include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after signing an agreement, while the PA agrees to allow the presence for only five years.
Shooters in the pest control trial had to be carefully supervised by the foresters while the trial was being studied and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Australian Association of Sporting Shooters (NSW) Inc, they recruit qualified volunteers as part of a shooting program of the Association of Sporting Shooters.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the substitute Director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage at NPWS, the four chosen for the first shooting operation received detailed instructions on safety and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's first Prime Minister in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEO as part of measures to advance the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the failed organization of elections, some of which were postponed since 2011.
Around 60 instances of overheating non-functioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that 27 accidents related to the devices are known to it.
Last week, MEKI announced that Apple informed it about 34 new overheating incidents, which the company calls "minor."
The ministry reacted, calling the delay of the report by Apple "truly regrettable".
The earthquake shook Mariano at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The emergency management office of the Northern Marianas said that there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by seizing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been released, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an old woman who needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed the example of his father and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Working at the hospital, Liggins began exploring preterm birth during his free time.
His research showed that the administration of the hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetal lung in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes', flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Quite unique, like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as bizarre as I... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the opinion poll share this viewpoint, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the opinion poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there were doubts about his ability.
He could not use the medications needed to endure his pain because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery, using various devices and software, until the early days of February, and it was declared on Tuesday.
Comets could potentially be a source of water delivery for Earth, as well as of organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, age 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
He will supposedly try to be elected as president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to FAA claims, will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older terrestrial radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being operated, and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, nor are parking lots or park-and-ride options available at the location.
Fear of lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game will have to be played behind closed doors, without supporters of the team.
A study published Thursday in the magazine Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process likely took more time, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into a wide variety of forms. It can be rolled flat into thin shapes.
It can be drawn to obtain a thin wire, which can be folded and braided. It can be hammered or rolled flat into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was once used to embellish hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using beet juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, compress them into a ball shape.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel strange and form a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet almost in every house, connected to a complex system of channels.
Remains of drainage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and reflects it down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
A gigantic rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing enabled by the wheel is the provision of much easier and faster transportation.
Because of it, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat the much more numerous prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, specialization, which retains every cat, so they do not have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats; they live in groups called prides.
A group consists of one to three related adult males and many, up to thirty, females and offspring.
The females are usually closely related to each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides function quite similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, which surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to prey.
A very harmonious athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times more strongly than a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of hoarse, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find edible animals (prey) by smell, sniffing the tracks on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originates (as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need, in order to be a strong competitor, to have different features or adaptations compared to those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less similar to the other population.
Finally, over the course of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetables. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, therefore it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set in its palate, meaning that nothing that encountered it could escape.
Some are not sure, but it may have been that it had a bifurcated tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe it was even a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus would be without a chance against it.
Although we would recognize most of their food, the Romans indeed had their array of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting in chairs, rich men liked to have feasts together, where they would recline on their sides, eating their dishes.
Among the dishes of Ancient Rome, there could not be foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to tend to the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were constructed as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family took place in the fresh air.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and on his way further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is a writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days of its existence the large parchment document (its dimensions are 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So probably the note was added simply as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained unfree.
It was governed by the French of "Vichy". These were French people who reconciled with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this somehow defines the dimension of the society.
City-states are predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural trace, and sufficiently large dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government — with a congress as its sole component — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to collect taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it entrusted the execution of its decisions to state authorities, who were often uncooperative.
It also did not have the right to override tax laws and customs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before any change, and states were so indifferent towards the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The national football team of Italy, as well as the national football team of Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the composition/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, in a geographical sense, an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan started long ago in the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island, in passing.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, altering the indigenous methods of grain production and employing Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Until 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for taking still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film dimension at the close of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its ratio has been inherited from the sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 34 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (the APS format, for example) are equal to or very close to this proportion.
The much-maligned and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamism, maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, became the object of critical examination.
Over the span of more than a thousand years, the Christian religion connected European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-encompassing power touched everyone from king to citizen.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist specifically for that purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether that dogma was being obeyed.
Shortly after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved its effectiveness, it cut off crucial military and civilian supplies, although that blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements from the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent the entry of any ships into entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because such a tactic had a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited military use of submarines.
During the 1910s, the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutalities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid a return to such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of indicating different time periods; each era in China or each family that ruled was a distinct dynasty.
Also among all the dynasties, there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of such periods was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, furious battles took place among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed for the success of the most ambitious and successful.
The same is true for the soldiers, because instead of military ranks previously based on class, they were now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was profoundly interested in matters beyond this everyday life. He frequented a cave, which became known as "Hira'" on the mountain "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved through time, gives a clear image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Situated at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easily found, even if one knows that it exists. When one is in the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing else is visible except the cloudless, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world is visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramid structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), some small tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples, many were constructed to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "arch up" mark looks like a V and the "arch down" mark like a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
Up means that you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you have to start at the heel (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a more delicate sound, while the down-bow is stronger and firmer.
Do not hesitate to add your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed bowings are there for a musical reason, so usually they should be observed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were brought back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd, making noise and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd caused the king and queen to widely open the carriage windows.
At one point, a mob member waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military expenditures of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and the percentage of the bonds circulating in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the vast exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that helped in the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000—1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, and it was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that practically covers a wide range of ideas, from technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has "consequences" for societies that are essentially intrinsic and not socially conditioned.
One could, for example, say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being designed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and those, more harmonious with the society's location, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, so was Constantinople considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 BC.
In the twelfth century, its status declined mainly because the crusaders returned bringing silks and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine bazaars.
It was in that time that the title of Fashion Capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th—11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow means of communication, styles in the west could lag by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the significant achievements of the period was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food for the needs only of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seeds indigenous to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to enlarge the harvest.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still true in many developing states.
Subcultures unite people with similar viewpoints who feel overlooked by social norms and allow them to foster a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The determining characteristics for a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often signify their membership through recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, affectation, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, bad luck, or malicious mistreatment, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, such abandonment of a child was due to the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Children who have become wild might have experienced severe mistreatment or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some, it is said, lived independently in nature.
Raised only by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of physical constraints) almost entirely similar to those of the specific caregiving animal, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, like using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, both a teacher is a variant of scaffolding and the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffold is built into the software and must ask, suggest, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the learner if they were acting independently.
Children find themselves in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring, and educational, yet that still happens.
We regard the foster care system as a safety zone for such children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Guardianship must provide everything necessary that they lacked in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet add additional dimensions to the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” as new motivational aspects when they explored public responses to websites.
The use of videorecording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to determine if a person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated that people who cannot understand speech due to brain trauma can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even supposes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of visible variation.
Segregation and recombination remix the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plants.
Additionally, failure to do so has serious consequences: decreased growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be proteins available from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality proteins that contain the essential amino acids.
Considering all the circumstances, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking during your usual sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to regain consciousness without fully waking up.
If you notice that you are resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be left on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Among other options based on biorhythms is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which will make you get out of bed to urinate.
The extent of inner peace a person has negatively correlates with the extent of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the road to that goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
Principally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. By visualizing various deities, one purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates the enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, a clash of systems, processes, and cultures caused a split between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last the next 40 years and would have real battles, with proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, the only hope remained to retreat and reorganize according to the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became outdated almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, breaking the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The work of a navy traditionally has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while also preventing your enemy from moving their people and goods.
Most notable among the recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the allies failed, Germany would likely be able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started to breed them because of easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds wandering on hills and other pastures, often tended by goatherds, who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
Railroads were being constructed in England since no later than the 16th century.
Although wagonways simply consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Sleepers appeared early enough to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it became clear that tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top.
That became a popular practice, but iron caused more rapid wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known transportation was by walking; humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright human).
Their ancestors, australopithecines, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus likely walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to relate more amicably to the environment, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can even be activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
That is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we want not only a temporary solution, then we must find the causes of the problems and we must deactivate them.
Of course, the world has been greatly changed by the scientific and technological achievements of humanity, and problems have become larger due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of humanity.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the congressional president John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent on the 6th of July to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on the 9th of July. A copy arrived in London on the 10th of August.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides, which are known to exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives now. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs, like a tyrannosaurus.
Almost all currently used computers are based on the processing of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, using computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough to preclude an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is informally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long-standing familiarity with lice, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Rabocims and lithocims are both nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or domicile of their host.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child does not best serve their interests or the interests of their child.
Such couples can choose to plan an adoption for their baby.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
It is, however, not alone; experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning, and observation also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's viewpoints on all fields of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As proficiency in Greek declined, the West became evidently separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms that do not simply respond to external periodic stimuli have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that maintain a period of repetitive, autonomous functioning even without external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of various effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the involved cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna wildlife.
Among the examples of on-site activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and there take photographs and learn about orangutans.
Every morning people leave small towns by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is somehow involved and contributing to a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states, which had been supporting human evolution for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears a similar level of complaints about water quality or about the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because one cannot predict the behavior of a driver with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform arrangement; thus, traffic flows strive to have some moderate uniformity and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, developing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to develop flight. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid predators and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places against predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seemed sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever succeeded in surpassing the pyramids of Giza in terms of the size and technical skill of their construction.
Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official relations.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about the basic chemical elements — like gold, silver, and copper — since ancient times, because these can be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he continued theorizing that they become new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that in the periodic table there are many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Certainly, there are also metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys, in the composition of which there are small quantities of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good tool for many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, due to the emergence of new ways of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The nuclear bomb operates on such a principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a slope. Splitting the nucleus then releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to decay with slight or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the hidden side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
Perhaps there are more seas on the near side, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to flow out onto the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates people to act or challenges them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized during maturation into adulthood.
These theories explore what it is about certain people that makes them desire the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. One end of the spectrum is the effort to remain "one of the friends."
This type of administrator finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, assess work performance, assign tasks, and demand accountability from people.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual, who feels that he or she must change everything the team previously did and appropriate it.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same high-quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may be misunderstood by their local managers.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of practically applying the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently used across the operating departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process when an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching cognition. It thus narrows the field of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior makes scientists continue the research.
It is a long-known fact that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The progress of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that were never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models, which help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has a strong nuance of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Among the examples are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
Those things became separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and warfare, and they are also incorporated into some home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any education. Quite often, a teacher would like to take their students to places not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art, while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is another great way to reflect on a journey and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital; each year a new version of the website appears, but the old versions remain accessible to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing among students. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because learners are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes learners become more understanding about the world around them." The need to nurture public interest inspires learners to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages learners to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable learners to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, learners can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also outline their own viewpoints on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada and it has an array of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and more things highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider essentially Canadian.
Vast areas further north are quite sparsely populated, some are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
The following comparison of populations surprises many: there are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens in total.
The Islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is incomparably the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is an independent continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or linked to France, and known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and it took strong root in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century, when the explorer Vasco da Gama from Portugal initiated the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their true marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should note that cultural differences can result in what one might perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with men's proposals and do not fear to be unyielding (regardless of whether cultural or not, a difference is not necessarily tolerable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them with the name Casa Branca, but nevertheless, they left after the earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the sultan of Morocco under the name Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish traders, who established trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
Regarding shopping, Casablanca is among the most uninteresting places throughout Morocco.
Around the old town center, it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather items, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the volcano Nyiragongo destroyed Goma, covering most of the city streets with its magma, especially in the city center.
Goma offers sufficient security, but one must be informed about each visit outside of it to know the state of the ongoing battles in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo in addition to the most affordable tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel through Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but it is a tourist attraction because of its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the Red List of World Heritage due to the threatening sands from the desert.
It was one of the most important stops during the special program Wonders of the African World by PBS made by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts greatly with the other cities in the country because it has a style more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe, and south to the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 separate ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It represents one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most symbolic among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entrance fees for the park.
It is also useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and it is the place that many tourists consider the most interesting.
The line of buildings that creates the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shining histogram, evident due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross over to the promenade located on the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on land that has been reclaimed from the sea on the northern shoreline.
This is the place that the British colonizers appropriated for themselves, and therefore, if one seeks evidence of the colonial past of the territory, here is a convenient place to start looking.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) along the coastline into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest, however, is not just a marshland of mangroves. In it are some of the last refuges of the impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water or swamps.
In 1966 Sundarbans became a reserve, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal royal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in its territory.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most leave between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Because inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are connected by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are fast and comfortable means of transportation for traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters wide, and it has two corridors 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical below the bridge is 15 meters distant. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational again in September 2017, when it is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will have been completed.
The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group living in that area, which is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was a settlement of other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "The Great Province of Indians," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began an era of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is very well known because its polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the Polish fields near Las Cañitas.
Here one can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Inquire at the Argentine Polo Association about news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West shop in Stanley.
Everywhere on the islands, British pounds are generally accepted, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outer islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but you can use British and American money; ask in advance to know which payment method is accepted.
Since it is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, exchange the money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures seldom drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the rainfall is almost the same throughout the whole year.
Although many of the park's animals have become accustomed to the presence of humans, the animals are still wild and they should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities request that people stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they seem, bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept themselves at an adequate distance. Because these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, keep their space.
Furthermore, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, and therefore avoid bringing or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and it became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbor was the scene of the infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the efforts for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the killing of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the Northhaven district) are on the Pacific and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where one can safely swim, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches where shops line abundantly along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many drinkable wines from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may perhaps be imported better.
It is completely safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easily available if one has concerns.
To Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. Espresso is a "short black," cappuccino is topped with abundant cream (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the standards of Belgium. Juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the whole year, there are many excursions to the reef, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signals, and pay careful attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770. They can sometimes appear outside of that time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. The majority of sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away from them.
Marine crocodiles do not actively live in the sea. Their main habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep upon arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but you may be able to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through such agents.
Travel agents generally arrange plans that include breakfast, transportation arrangements for airport access and departure, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for the intended place (for example, a visa).
All changes or requests, however, must first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of attendees decide to camp on-site, and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you'll need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that music on the main stages may have stopped, but there might be parts of the festival where it will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals provide special campsites for families with small children.
If you navigate the northern Baltic in winter, pay attention to the cabin's location, because going through ice causes quite a terrible noise in the most affected ones.
Cruise ships to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers from cruise ships are visa-free (check the conditions).
Casinos normally strive for guests to spend the maximum of their time and money. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special foods, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to retain them inside.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but drunkenness impairs mental ability, and every good gambler is aware of how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who drives a vehicle in high latitudes or across mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice, or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is minimal and therefore one cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, the amount of snow capable of blocking you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow or wind, by condensation, or by ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
A safari is perhaps the most attractive thing for tourists in Africa and the most outstanding for many visitors.
The word "safari" is popularly used to mean overland travel to observe the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and ordinary tools provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes appear shy, so binoculars will help you see them better.
Walking safari (also known as "bush walk," "walking safari," or "hiking") consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be in other locations throughout Japan.
Having hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics.
If you booked the flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you are probably in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that the tickets for the majority of events will cost from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, and that typical tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if one does not want to wear ironed socks, they might try using a dryer, if it is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause burns in it).
There are different means to purify water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others, several minutes are necessary.
Filters have different efficiencies and, if you care about that, then consider buying the water in a sealed bottle from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unknown in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transport infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing a person by force are generally not counted as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the option to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, sometimes passing through isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be very careful: there are plenty of steep slopes, narrow corridors, and tight curves.
Signal speed limits are notably lower than those of previous and subsequent sections – often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and they must be strictly obeyed, even more so than otherwise.
It is remarkable that cell service is still much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very delicious, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbor in the south, Austria.
There are many fruit pastries that contain either apples throughout the year or cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes usually go especially well with a cup of intense coffee.
If you want some small but rich cakes, try those that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is typically added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 eligible islands, Indonesian cuisine is a megaterm covering a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without additional qualifying words, the term generally refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now easily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of spiced foods, with flavors preferred by the Javanese, namely peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Hanging from both sides of the saddle, stirrups serve as supports for the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can present safety problems because the rider's feet could potentially get caught in them.
If, while riding, one falls off a horse with a foot caught in the stirrup, one could be dragged by the possibly fleeing horse. To minimize this risk as much as possible, various safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, the majority of riders wear riding boots with a heel and a sole that is smooth and fairly narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars such that a falling rider can pull them backward to detach the stirrup leather from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley: the most important place for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer astonishing panoramas. Climbers from every part of the world tirelessly create new routes from the endless possibilities of the walls.
Downhill winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one glides downward on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are known as "ski fanatics" and who plan entire vacations based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Downhill skiing has been counted as a sport since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called field skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It relates to alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, but it usually does not imply them, as these latter occur on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as if it were similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover distances somewhat greater than during walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy backpack on maintained trails.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel through several countries one needs to repeatedly fulfill visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen Area, however, operates in this respect as if it were a single country.
Provided that one remains within this area, one can generally cross borders without the need to go through passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa to each Schengen country, which saves you time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what goods are considered antiques. Some tax agencies classify as antiques items that are more than 100 years old.
Because the definition varies locally, in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
One could consider handicrafts as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the culture surrounding this trade is also significant for many other craftsmen.
Even in tradition, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but they lived from fishing, hunting, or something similar, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi work in modern jobs. Tourism offers significant income to Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially by non-Romani people, it is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and erroneous ideas about the Romani people.
If a travel warning is declared against the country to be visited, it may affect your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
It is also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, even though they are directed towards their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face situations different from those affecting Europeans or Arabs.
A warning is just a brief summary of the political situation of some country.
The presented views are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it consists of various types that depend on the location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Storms, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are manifestations and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather are blizzards, snowstorms, winter storms, and sandstorms.
It is highly advisable for travelers to pay attention to any type of severe weather risk that affects their area, as this may impact any travel plans.
Anyone intending to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An online search for a hostile environment course will most likely show the address of a local company.
The course will generally cover in much more detail all the matters presented here, usually with practical experience.
One course will usually last 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about survival in the wilderness, but there are few such works about war zones.
Travelers who plan gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return.
The willingness to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or updated documents consistent with the desired name varies from government to government.
Whether foreign governments tend to accept such documents also varies greatly.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period following September 11, 2001.
Unoperated transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity remaining intact.
Surf is a backward flow of waves breaking at a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Due to the underwater diverse formations, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper sections, where a rapid flow to the depth can occur.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of people trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as one swims out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills or whether you've been noticed, maybe you prefer to wait until someone rescues you.
The return shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have particular difficulty readapting to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your native culture.
When people traveled abroad for the first time, they likely had patience and understanding because they realized that travelers need to accommodate themselves to the new country.
People may not foresee that patience and understanding are also needed with travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting children's attractions in the region.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Here you will generally hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The narration of sound and light is just like a novel.
The sphinx is set in the background and it is the storyteller of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries and they have the majority of bases, sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, on which the settlement Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, whose flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a striking natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
United with the plateau here, the mountain range of the peninsula then reappears forming the Ellsworth mountain chain, which is 360 kilometers long and is bisected by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or mountain chain Sentinel has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak Vinson is 4892 m high.
In very remote places without access to a mobile network, a satellite phone may be the only means of communication.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone because one needs to be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including those for pleasure, and also by expeditions, which have needs for remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider could further inform you about the connection to this service.
For those who plan a sabbatical year, it is increasingly popular to travel and study.
This is especially popular among those who finish secondary education because it gives them a gap year before going to university, without risking their education.
In many cases, if you join a gap year course abroad, it can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education when you return to your home country.
Normally, there will be a registration fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great travel destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and on the lakes, one does not necessarily need a yacht.
Despite the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes being actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland: one in every seven or eight Finns owns a boat.
Such popularity is only seen in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand. But otherwise, it is a rather unique statistic (for example, in the Netherlands one in every forty people has a boat).
The majority of the various Baltic cruise ships also include a stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can fully use a few days to visit the historic city, returning at night to the ship to sleep there.
If one disembarks only through the cruise excursions, a separate visa is not necessary (since 2009).
The brochures of some cruise ships include Berlin, in Germany. As can be seen above on the map, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience regardless of age and background, especially if one has never flown or if one has gone through a traumatic experience.
It is not a shameful affair: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes in other respects, which many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on not knowing or controlling things.
Courier companies receive good money for the quick delivery of items. Often time is very important for business documents, goods, or replacement parts for urgent repair.
In some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem in other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent things by freight plane, on some routes several days could pass in the completion of unloading and customs.
The only way to accomplish that faster was to send things as registered packages. According to airline regulations, one cannot send a package without a related passenger, and here is where you seize the opportunity.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to spend a very thick stack of money for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you instead).
However, this is not cheap: according to a rough estimation, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy class fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth the effort to look for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know well that there exists a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is recognized by no UN member state.
Economic ties were resumed between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once having been the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center, situated by a vast gulf and surrounded by mountains.
Among the wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers, traditional roofs made of red tiles, 18th-century bazaars, and old mosques and churches appear scattered, but the atmosphere of the city is more that of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and it has an unusual octagonal church.
On some tombs in the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It is worth spending half an hour on a walk through the intriguing village.
To the north and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron praised its grand merits.
The bus route 403 from Scotturb regularly travels to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (shrine), which is the site of the world-famous apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass graveyard and also a place with almost incalculable significance for an important part of the world's inhabitants.
Many men and women who survived their ordeal here still remain, and there are even more people who had loved ones who were killed or worked to death there, whether they were Jews or not.
Please behave in the place with as much dignity, solemnity, and respect as it fully deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place with marks or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. More or less half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
But nevertheless, most of the posters are only in Catalan because the law declared it the first official language.
In any case, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
In the metro, regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris have acquired a reputation for being egocentric, unfriendly, and arrogant people.
This is often just an inaccurate stereotype, but the best way to maintain smooth relationships with Parisians is to behave as if one were "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will greatly facilitate the journey.
The abrupt manners of Parisians will quickly evaporate if one shows basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly consisting of beeches, spruces, and firs, and it presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of vegetarian communities is remarkably high due to the range of microclimates, diverse terrains, and different altitudes.
The region is also home to extremely diverse animals and bird species.
There one can find rare fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats, and wood grouse, in addition to many more common species.
During a visit to the monasteries, women must wear knee-length skirts and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do provide linens to women who arrive unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own linens, especially if they are brightly colored.
Similarly, men must wear knee-length pants.
You can also borrow that from the storage at the entrance, but they do not wash those clothes after each use, and therefore you might not feel comfortable if you use these skirts. There is one size for all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like those of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and it uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available addition, like cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun, in addition to the word Sie meaning you, always starts with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing becomes somewhat more complicated because it is necessary to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in the nominalized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in the Italian language because most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main noteworthy letters are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Additionally, one must certainly pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means chariot.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively easy and regular in most cases.
Therefore, reading this grammatical introduction would help you learn a lot of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if one speaks a Romance language, it will make learning Portuguese easier.
But nevertheless, people who speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it is not worth learning it separately.
Generally, pre-modern observatories are outdated today and remain as museums or educational institutions.
Because at that time light pollution was not the problem that it is today, they are generally located in cities or at universities, places more easily accessible than those where the ones built in modern times are.
The most modern telescopes for research are enormous installations in remote locations under favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, also known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other aristocrats around the imperial court.
Because plants look best in a natural environment, do not give in to the temptation to remove specimens, not even "just one."
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also cause your expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to explore. Upon arrival, you can buy almost anything there.
But still, since you will be in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
Additionally, there are a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the patriarchs from the Bible: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme on which to base vacations.
This would make it possible, for example, to visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or to go on a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or by boat along the Erie Canal.
They additionally specify routes of known roads for hiking and cycling.
Christmas is among the most important holidays of Christianity. It celebrates the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers living in Christian countries or elsewhere around the world have adopted many of the traditions of this festival.
Traditionally, people spend the Easter night awake in an outdoor place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
On the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil and the congregations begin celebrating exactly at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived at the archipelago came either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance between the islands and the continent, mammals could not make such a journey, and therefore the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since their arrival, people have introduced many mammals to the Galapagos, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, that is, the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance to see the aurora borealis because the sky will be almost always dark.
You will also be able to enjoy the stars, because these regions are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are the normal work attire and coworkers address each other by family names or job titles.
Workplace harmony is most important, just like an emphasis on group effort instead of praise for individual achievements.
Workers usually have to obtain their superiors' approval for all decisions made and they must obey instructions without question.
