While it seems that there is one experimental vaccine capable of reducing Ebola deaths, so far, no suitable drugs have been proven for treating existing infections.
One cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promise in this field, but official studies indicated that the benefit derived from this cocktail was less than the benefits sought in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, the drug ZMapp was used as a control standard, meaning that the scientists set it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
The United States Gymnastics supports the message of the U.S. Olympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.

It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a common theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally fail to offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown from above and pale or carotenoid-colored on its underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed shaft, called a "rachis," but they have other feather features such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flying but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers propose that although this tail belonged to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows mature feathers, not a chick's backside.
The researchers pointed out that although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows adult bird feathers, not chick feathers.

And the work accomplished was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations noted about the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for might be caused by fundamental tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way galaxy attracts the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around it in a halo-like form, composed of small particles in large numbers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper indicating their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the envelope is placed in the ballot box, and they sign the voter's list.
The French electoral law regulates the procedures with an unwelcomed strictness.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of voting, and that only envelopes of duly registered and authorized voters, who are properly delegated, are added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under intensive supervision following specific procedures.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the Cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over the Business Minister position that Davey will vacate.
Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
Among the losses were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Figuela sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider required reconstructive surgery for his face.
"Schneider" suffers from constant pain, blindness in one eye, the loss of a part of his skull, and a face reconstructed from titanium. All this happened when the "Oka" weapon failed while it was aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony via a video link from an American Air Force base in his homeland.
After the Wednesday event, Carbonedo competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first race was the slalom, where she got a "Did Not Finish" result in her first round. A total of 36 out of 116 competitors received the same result in this race.
Her other race - the Giant Slalom - saw her earn tenth place in the women's sitting category with a total running time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Austrian Claudia Lösch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place finisher, Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers on the disabled team failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom race failed to secure a ranking in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen computer and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanja, Rambro Kanjar, Ghaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Director Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Despite the presence of three people inside the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
But the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT car.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness may be questionable because her picture has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts considered the publication of photos to be potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "it seems to me that journalists are certainly heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or anything similar concerning suspects."
The Crown Office, generally responsible for the allegations, informed journalists that there would be no further comments until at least after the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
Other topics that are said to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered an important issue for both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the continuation of the military presence in the valley for a period of ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to continue this presence for only five years.
The guards had to closely supervise the released individuals in the supplementary pest control experiment, as the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the "National Parks and Wildlife Service" and the "Sporting Shooters Association of Australia," qualified volunteers were selected under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick Ovlin, Acting Director of the Parks and Heritage Conservation Organization under the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new provisional electoral council made up of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the interim electoral council as part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, erupted due to the failure to hold the elections that have been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of excessive temperature malfunctions in iPod devices have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported an additional 34 incidents of overheating, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's call to postpone the report by saying it is "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office stated that no damages have been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no indications of a possible tsunami wave.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six people has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, in addition to the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Leighlin followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and then began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
"Legends" began investigating preterm birth during his free time, while working at the hospital.
His research demonstrated that administering one of the hormones accelerates the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
"Xinhua" reported that government investigators retrieved the flight recorders, also known as the "black box," on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A strong, unique woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was eccentric like me... and maybe even more so than me... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed in the pre-2010 federal election poll, the percentage of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed agree with this viewpoint and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding the polar opposites in the poll, 29% of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought that Australia should never be a republic.
The physical fitness of the Olympic gold medalist became questionable due to his complaints, as he was scheduled to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain since its use is prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different devices and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth, along with organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed since the comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term early this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
He is likely to run for presidency in 2016.
Nexgen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses technology connected to satellites, unlike the old technology that uses ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft with higher precision and provide pilots with more specific information.
There are no additional transport services, and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley, in addition to the lack of parking spaces and park-and-ride facilities on the ground.
Fears of a transportation shortage raised the possibility that the match might be forced to take place behind closed doors, without the presence of team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although it was believed that this process takes much longer - due to the interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, the migrant cactus finch, and the sharp-beaked ground finch.
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a fine wire, can be wrapped and removed. It can be polished or rolled into sheets.
They can be made extremely thin and affixed to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn images in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called the pH level of the chemical, and you can create an indicator for this level using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance to be tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then compress them with clean, wet hands until they form into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a drainage mechanism in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the homes of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would attend together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
It requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the shape of the world in astonishing ways; however, providing an easier and faster means of transportation remains the most important contribution it has made for us.
The train, the car, and many other means of transportation have brought to us.
Below them in rank, there are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, a specific role for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
A lion pride consists of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closer to each other; they become a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, animals similar to the lion (but not other big cats) exhibit similar behaviors and are extremely deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with a force five times that of a human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion; it is more akin to shouting angry words.
Pygmy tigers love to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals hunted by the pygmy tiger are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that sand cats track and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell; they sense where they were on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision and move with extreme stealth. Pygmy leopard animals hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in previously.
Given that this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the newly established group will need different characteristics or means of adaptation in order to become a stronger competitor compared to the strength it required previously.
There has been absolutely no change in the indigenous people; they still need the same ways of adaptation as we have known them.
Over time, as the new inhabitants begin to adapt to their new environment, their resemblance to other populations gradually decreases.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look different to the extent that we cannot call them the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans release (i.e., exhalation).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other Mosasauruses.
Its two long jaws were studded with more than 70 blade-like teeth, in addition to another set in the roof of its mouth, which means there was no escape for anything in its path.
We do not know for certain, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he was probably a carnivore.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not match it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of odd or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
There was another contrast in that while the poor and women ate their meals seated on benches, the wealthy men liked to hold banquets together where they would recline on their sides while having their meals.
It was not possible for ancient Roman meals to include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods during festivals and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard leading to a secure sanctuary that only the priests can enter.
Sometimes unique towers were built in the shape of pyramids called ziggurats to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not have much importance.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were merely open counters overlooking the street. Stone was used in the construction of houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive.
Greenland was inhabited by few humans. It is said in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on charges of murder, and when he traveled westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there previously.
There were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history in the countries of "Denmark," "Sweden," "Norway," and "Iceland," despite each country being "Scandinavian."
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a map to treasure.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed with the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of this part of the text is not specifically known, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
France was governed by "Vichy." These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France, and they were on their way toward Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The origin of the word "civilization" is from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil," and it is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," which also defines it in terms of social mass.
Self-governing cities are akin to the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a remaining cultural imprint, and the fair dissemination of knowledge.
Minor cultures often fade away without leaving any actual historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — with Congress constituting the only element of it — under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were mostly uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Additionally, it does not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs imposed between states.
The articles required unanimous approval by all states before they could be amended, and the states ridiculed the central government to the extent that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to - from a geographic perspective - as an "archipelago."
Taiwan began its pathway back in the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as lha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan and began altering indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the Qing dynasty armies (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan in favor of Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static image format in the world is 35 millimeters, which is the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by image sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm model is actually somewhat confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this image (when divided by 12 to obtain the ratio to the simplest integer) will be 3:2.
Many popular formats (such as the Advanced Photo System format, for example) equal or approximate this aspect ratio.
The triangulation rule, which is often misused and mocked, forms a straightforward guiding principle that creates dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in a clear picture.
It is noted that the most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity linked the European countries together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive power I possessed affected everyone, from the king to the general public.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial assets exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question how well it fulfilled the requirements of the doctrine.
Britain quickly initiated a naval blockade of Germany after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective; it cut off crucial military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law, which has been codified and coordinated in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sectors of the oceans, a measure that threatens even neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with Edison’s company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method for illustrating different time periods; each era or dynasty in power was different in kind.
Additionally, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each ruling dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, a fierce war arose among many nobles in the pursuit of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died during the fighting for the sake of sitting on the highest seats in the grand palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from despotism to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just to the ruler.
As after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the army, as instead of the army's ranks being based on class, they are now dependent on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to spark their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcend this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that came to be known as "Hira," atop the "Mountain of Light," for meditation.
The cave itself, which has remained through the ages, offers a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it at all, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, you are in complete isolation.
And nothing can be seen except for the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. Only very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in the Giza Governorate is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era, the Great Pyramid is considered one of the massive pyramids built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's valley of the dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was constructed to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "down bow" symbol looks like a staple or a square without its bottom side.
The top mark indicates that you should start from the end and push the bow, while the bottom mark means you should start from the other end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to draw your own marks in pencil, but remember that the printed curved marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people who were shouting and cheering against the king and queen.
A group of fans managed to force the king and queen to open the windows of their car wide open.
At some point, a member of the gang waved the head of one of the slain royal guards at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people incurred the expenses of the United States' imperialist war in its invasion of the Philippines.
These individuals were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Naturally, the excessive profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the primary gains of American imperialism.
We must understand the motivating context behind the establishment of the organization in order to comprehend the Knights Templar.
The era in which those events occurred was known as the High Middle Ages, which is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which all together end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological necessity to the strict feeling that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two general ideas common in most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology, in turn, has "effects" on inherently rather than societally linked communities.
For example, one might say that the engine of the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the creation of a road network spanning the country is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new ways are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective ownership of cars also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which results in the development of new healthcare technologies to treat damaged bodies.
Romance had a significant element of cultural determinism derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography emerged. These individuals, being in harmony with the location of society, were considered better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is renowned as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in the year 400 AD and continued until the year 1100 AD.
Its condition declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusades returned bearing with them gifts such as silk and spices, which were of higher value than what Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, Paris was given the title of the fashion capital instead of Constantinople.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, Byzantine culture in the East had a strong influence on clothing.
Nevertheless, due to the slowness of communication channels, trends in the West may be delayed by approximately 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is the type of agriculture conducted to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
The subsistence farming system uses preserved indigenous seeds in the eco-region alongside crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields. It is a simple system and is often organic.
Historically, most farmers worked in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures reconcile like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define the uniqueness of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes clothing, mannerism, and jargon.
Among the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is relying on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, were socially unconnected by adults during their upbringing.
Some wayward children were confined by individuals (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability, and these children are referred to as "feral" or wild.
The feral children may have been subjected to abuse during childhood or severe traumas before being abandoned or fleeing.
And others are alleged to have been raised by animals; while it is said that some lived in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble those of the particular caregiving animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather an auxiliary means that provides support to individuals who are undergoing a new educational experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and on-site. In other words, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as is the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is internally supported in the program and aims to encourage questioning, motivation, and explanation of procedures that may be difficult for the student to manage independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not based on nurturing, care, and education, but they do.
We recognize that the foster care system constitutes a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessities that they lacked in the homes they previously left.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to usage and methods of gratification.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions of the face, which are facial movements lasting only a few fractions of a second.
It is particularly claimed that one can discover whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper that the president's speech indicates that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are capable of evaluating honesty accurately.
In fact, it suggests the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior might be shared with some animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown the existence of two groups of genetic variations: a latent group and another that is genetically expressive.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, while selection removes them from the pool of expressive differences.
The processes of segregation and recombination work to make the variation random back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
The failure to do so will lead to dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Plant resources were the most accessible for obtaining proteins from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates to digest unless they are cooked like we do.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of proteins and contain all essential amino acids.
Taking all things into consideration, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your natural sleep period and returning to sleep after a short period (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, based on biological systems, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more positivity is granted by the life force. Every person has the innate ability to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on the path to this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has expanded through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everyone.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations, with "Kundalini Yoga."
The Tibetan meditation center is the deity yoga. Through visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment awareness is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. However, by the end of the war, the clash of systems, policies, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two states.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies have now become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
This war was supposed to last for the next forty years, with the fighting taking place on the ground by proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga for peace, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditions have it that the role of naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time intercepting the ability of your enemy to transport his people and goods.
One of the more notable modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans attempted to transport personnel and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to assist Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion, primarily using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often tended by goat herders who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the widely known shepherd. These grazing methods are still in use today.
Carriage roads were established in England at a time dating back to the 16th century.
Despite the fact that old railway cars consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and carry larger loads compared to roads that were considered more than rugged at that time.
Railroad tracks were relatively invented early to fix the pathways, but it later turned out that placing an iron bar on top of the track makes it more effective.
This became a customary practice, but the iron led to further corrosion of the wooden wheels of the carts.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, coinciding with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means the upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright consistently.
Bipedal species were found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't only want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems, and we must eliminate them.
It is clearly evident that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to population growth and the luxurious lifestyle of humans.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few buildings away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on the eighth of July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his forces in New York on July 9th. A copy of it arrived in London on August 10th.
The twenty-five Dunlap broadsides represent the oldest surviving copies of the United States Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like dinosaurs.
All computers used today virtually rely on processing encoded information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, if we use the conventional computer language.
Internal poisoning symptoms may not appear immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms like vomiting appear, as they are quite common.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to the poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its official sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both "assassin bugs" and "bed bugs" are characterized by a long incubation period and adapt to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as males.
Two spouses may decide that it is not in their interest or in the interest of their child to raise an infant.
These couples might choose to set up an adoption plan for their children.
As part of the adoption process, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Nevertheless, experimentation and the test trial is not the only method that can be used to refute one or more potential hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, particularly, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
While knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of intrinsic cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The documentation of periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, has been made for most living organisms, including those specific to bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-oscillators that will continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label either the phage's nucleic acid using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wildlife and plant life.
Examples of activities that can be done at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting the orangutans, photographing them, and learning information about them in Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to their workplaces, and along the way, they meet others who are working in the place they have just left.
In this bustling traffic movement, everyone somehow supports the transportation system that is centered around private cars and connects through it.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-dependent economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
It is rare to hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic movement is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic movement is difficult because a driver's behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic enjoys reasonable consistency, which can be mathematically approximated.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships between the three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings backward along the length of their bodies.
And this provides them with a larger selection of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems logical, because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to 6 miles at times.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the ancient Egyptian kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in terms of size and artistic excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were astonished by the monuments of their ancestors, which had lasted for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses the Italian language for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most state employees, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all these elements can be found in nature in their original form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. There are, of course, metals like silver and gold as well.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe was created from matter. All substances were created from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can occupy the space of the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without the need to use matches.
One cannot help but wonder what the keyboard might become when something newer than it arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it gathers energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. The core splits again, and part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is thinner beneath Maria and thicker beneath the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that manifest themselves when they reach adulthood.
These theories examine what makes some people want the things they do and the elements in their surrounding environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers; one is the attempt to remain "like the others."
This type of manager faces difficulty in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, determining responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the opposite end, the individual transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels they must change everything the team was doing and claim ownership over it.
In the end, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
They often have greater autonomy than members of traditional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team," as described by (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p.109), is considered a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member submits their reports to the management team, "the invisible team." The "invisible team" sets the standards for each member.
Why might an organization want to establish an educational organization when it is a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the purposes of applying organizational learning concepts.
By efficiently utilizing all available resources across the functional departments within the organization, creativity and ingenuity can be achieved.
As a result, the synergy within the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the development of new innovative procedures that meet the client's needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity method as a way used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Data related to neuroscience provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach in the investigation of knowledge. This, in turn, works to narrow the research area and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see brain structures and processes and conduct research on them in an unprecedented way.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence strongly alludes to science fiction, it constitutes an extremely important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnostics and inquiries, and in addition, recognizing handwriting, voice, and facial features.
Such things have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. It has also been used to build several software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are a significant part of any class. Often, the teacher may like to take her students to places that cannot be accessed by bus.
The technology provides a solution through virtual field visits. Students can view artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Additionally, sharing a virtual field trip is a great way to relive a specific trip and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with imperfect grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "force students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to materials on the Internet, students can identify their positions in the context of others' writings as well as determine their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, the charming bilingual capital of Canada, features a collection of art galleries and museums that highlight both Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is located in the far south, and to the north lies the house of beautiful, untapped nature in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
The large areas in the north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited.
In comparing population statistics that astonish many: the number of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Indeed, the island of Madagascar is the largest ever, and it is an independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most small islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the fifteenth century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
From the north, the African coast borders the region, and the Atlantic Ocean borders it from the south and west.
Women: Regardless of actual marital status, women travelers should state that they are married.
It is worthwhile to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences might lead to what they consider as harassment and that it is customary to be monitored, and held by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not make it acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa" after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca," only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Baida, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is considered one of the less exciting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, shisha, and all kinds of inexpensive items, but all of this is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside "Goma" should be explored to understand the ongoing combat situation in North Kivu province, while "Goma" is reasonably safe.
The city also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and offers some of the most affordable gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can ride a Boda Boda (which is a motorcycle taxi) to get around in the city of Goma, and the usual local price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Besides its relatively difficult accessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for distant, exotic lands.
Today, the city of Timbuktu is considered a poor city, despite its reputation that makes it a tourist attraction, in addition to having an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
One of the main stations for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS series about the wonders of the special African world.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country's cities, as it has a character that is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, stretching along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River marking its southern boundary.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a distinct wildlife.
It is considered one of the attractive areas in South Africa and is also regarded as a major park among South Africa's national parks (South African National Parks).
There is a daily fee to maintain and enter the park, similar to all national parks in South Africa.
It may be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, as it allows you access to a selected group of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name, and it is the place many tourists consider their destination.
The lined-up buildings that outline the skyline of Hong Kong are likened to a glittering chart appearing over the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite it.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of mangrove forests in the world, stretching for 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the remote coastal areas of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just swamps of mangrove trees; they contain some of the last remnants of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges River plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, approximately one-third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-regional station (across the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those headed to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because the buses within the areas are often full, it is better to buy the tickets in advance a few days before.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and strong.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It extends over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, and two tracks each with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to begin operating at full capacity in September 2017, at the same time when the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The "Guarani" were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now known as Eastern Paraguay. The Guarani lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was formerly known as "the Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of confrontation between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The largest competitions of the year are held in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
In addition, smaller championships and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and places to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to that of the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island located in Stanley, on the opposite side of the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley's credit cards, and often the United States dollar as well.
In remote islands, there is a possibility that credit cards may not be accepted, although British currency and American currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners to find out the accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so money should be exchanged before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer occurs there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is situated in the subtropical regions; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year, as there are no specific "rainy" or "dry" seasons.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they do not keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and extremely dangerous, and that is why you should not approach them.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of infamous naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German people drowned.
During the struggle organized by the Mao movement for independence, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the death of the high commander, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As a result of Auckland being located between two harbors, there are many beaches, with the most popular located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by botucou trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good array of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The basic popular beer is known as "Number One"; it is not a complex drink, but rather a fun and refreshing drink. The other local beer is called "Manta."
French wines come in many varieties, but New Zealand and Australian wines may achieve wider popularity.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. The small black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino often has cream piled on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, although they are expensive.
Many trips to the coral reefs are conducted throughout the year, and injuries to the coral reefs rarely occur for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. It can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away when they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles do not usually live in the ocean; their primary habitat is located in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking reassures the traveler that he will have a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his intended destination.
Although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
It is customary for travel agents to offer packages that include breakfast, and transportation arrangements to and from the airport, or even bundled packages that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or purchase other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Nevertheless, any changes or requests should be directed through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp on-site, considering it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get closer to the events, you must arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there are sections of the festival that may continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals include special camping areas for families with young children.
In case you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea area in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as passing over the ice causes extremely loud noise for the most affected people.
St. Petersburg cruises include spending some time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to increase the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it may be difficult to find exits.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment shows to maintain the guests' good mood and keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but intoxication impairs sound judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of remaining conscious.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snowfall, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were driving on smooth asphalt.
And during snowstorms, an amount of snow may fall that is enough to stop you for a very short time.
Snowfall, icy winds, condensation, or the presence of ice on car windows may cause limited visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Perhaps safari trips are the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important activity for many visitors.
The term safari is usually used to refer to travel across countries to observe the amazing wildlife in Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely, and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, leopards, and tigers sometimes feel shy, and you can see them better using binoculars.
Walking safari (also called "bush walk" or "hiking" or "trekking") consists of walking for long distances, either for a few hours or several days.

Travelers are likely to encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause nuisance, or trigger allergic reactions in the worst cases, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually described as pests.

The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont contains the toughest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it regularly passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not accustomed to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections—usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is more important than otherwise.
Strange, even though the mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other areas on the road. For example, the forests of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and diverse, resembling those of its southern neighbor, Austria.

Indonesian food represents a collective term that encompasses a large variety of regional cuisines spread throughout Indonesia, given that there are 17,000 islands in Indonesia to differentiate between them.
However, if used without additional terms, the term tends to mean that the food originates from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago's islands, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The dominant flavors preferred by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but their foot remains stuck in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wear horseback riding boots with heels and very tight, soft soles.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, are equipped with safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle when pulled backward as the rider dismounts.

Backpacking skiing: This activity is also called skiing in uninhabited areas, or ski trips, or snow hiking.
It is associated with alpine skiing tours or mountaineering, but it usually does not involve ice skiing tours or mountaineering, as they are practiced on steep terrain and require sturdier skis and long boots.
Think of the ice skating track as a trail similar to hiking.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking, but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across several countries means you have to go through visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
Nevertheless, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross the border without the need to go through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for entry visas for each of the Schengen member countries individually, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are over a hundred years old, but there is no comprehensive definition of what we consider antiques among manufactured items.
There are geographical differences in the definition, as the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be recognized as artifacts even though they are newer than the similar goods that were mass-produced in the distant past.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many other professionals.

The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies widely.
Inspections at security checkpoints have become much more intrusive on privacy in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity before surgery.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that cut across the shore, often at coral reefs or something similar.
Due to the underwater terrain, the returning flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a rapid current may form into the deep waters there.
Most deaths result from exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back will be no less easy than usual.
Try targeting a place where the current doesn't control you again or, depending on your skills and whether someone noticed your presence, waiting for rescue may be another option.
The shock of returning to the homeland occurs faster than cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.

The mountains of the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, which stretch for 360 km and are divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, where its peak is equivalent to 4,892 meters, Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, with the absence of cellular phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not considered a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used via shipping, including leisure boats, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
It is necessary to have a local phone service provider capable of providing more information about ways to contact this service.
Traveling and learning are increasingly popular options for those planning a gap year.
The matter is particularly popular among those who have finished the school education stage, as it allows them to spend a year before joining the university without risking their education.
Often, enrolling in a year-long training course abroad can enhance your chances of being admitted to higher education in your home country upon your return.

Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This corresponds to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is completely unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic premium cruises feature an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Good amounts are paid to shipping companies to deliver items quickly. Time is usually of great importance when it comes to business documents, goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
The largest companies own their own aircraft for some routes, but there was an issue for other routes and smaller companies.
In case they send the items by air freight, it may take several days on some routes for unloading and customs.
Sending parcels as checked baggage was the only way to receive them quickly, but airline regulations do not allow sending luggage without a passenger, so it's your turn at this stage.
The obvious way to be able to travel in first class or business class is to allocate a large sum of money to obtain this privilege (or it is better for you to have your company do it on your behalf).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there is no point in searching for discounts for business class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a specific main group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the advantage of reaching a destination quickly and in comfort, and they are charged accordingly.
