This not only confirms the widely known theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides detailed information that is usually lacking in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists revealed that the topside of this dinosaur's feathers was dark brown, while the underside was white or yellowish.
Such findings also provide insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft known as the rachis, but have other characteristic features, such as barbs and smaller branch-like structures, and researchers have speculated that these other features may have later evolved to develop into the rachis.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flying, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers examined samples from the tail of a young dinosaur and stated that they were feathers of an adult dinosaur, not the down of an infant.
This is the tail of a young dinosaur, but the researchers say that the sample reveals it is the feather of an adult individual rather than the down of a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor said that 19 of the injured were police officers.
The police have stated that they are suspecting the Daesh (ISIL) militant group, which claims responsibility for the attack.
They discovered that they operate solely based on the principles of luminescence and rotation, just like other stars.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the lesser the stellar activity in terms of magnetic reversals.

Although it relies mostly on theory, the program is designed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for may have been caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts its gravitational force on the Earth to cause tides, the Milky Way also exerts its force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way it affects ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is situated around it like a halo and is composed of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered XDR-TB (extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He mentioned in the interview that the new variant has 'a very high fatality rate, making it extremely difficult to handle and frightening.'
Dr. Moll thought that some patients might have been infected with the disease in the hospital, and at least two of them were believed to be healthy hospital workers.
Over the course of a year, there is a possibility that one infected person could infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience. Voters are isolated in booths and place a pre-printed piece of paper representing their candidate in an envelope.
After the staff verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the register of voters.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is nothing inside except for the legally counted envelopes of authorized voters, ensuring that no other envelopes are present at the start of voting.
The candidate can send a representative to observe the entire election process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision according to specific procedures.

Her first race was the downhill race, and she did not finish in the first run. Out of 116 athletes, 36 had the same result in that race.
In another race of hers in the giant slalom, she finished 10th with a total time of 4 minutes and 41 seconds, which was 2 minutes and 11.60 seconds slower than the first-place finisher, Austria's Claudia Loesch, and 1 minute and 9.2 seconds slower than Hungary's Gyongi Dani, who finished 9th.
Four skiers seated in the women's section did not reach the finish line, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom event were eliminated from the race.
Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
"D K Arya, the Deputy Inspector General, said they have arrested five people for raping a Swiss woman and have also recovered the victim’s mobile phone and portable computer."
The suspects' names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendant appeared in court with his face covered.
There were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed, and paramedics rescued the driver from a red Audi TT vehicle.
At first, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then relocated to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been charged in Edinburgh Court with the murder of her son.
She is being detained while awaiting indictment and trial, but due to her widely known reputation, the witness testimony may be biased.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law applies differently and the court considered the publication of the photograph as a potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says, 'If journalists release photos of suspects, they are walking a tightrope.'
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the overall prosecution, suggested to reporters that there would be no further comments at least until before the prosecution.
According to the leaked information, the document is likely related to the border disputes that Palestine desires, based on the pre-1967 Middle Eastern War borders.
According to reports, other topics include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded that the current stationed forces remain in the area for 10 years once the agreement was reached, and the PA agreed to have the forces leave after 5 years.
Because they monitored the trials and evaluated their effectiveness, the hunters involved in the additional pest control trials had to be closely supervised by the forest management officers.
Recruited qualified volunteers through the partnership between NPWS and the 'Australian Sports Shooter Association' following the hunting program of the 'Sports Shooter Association'.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have all received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday for the installation of the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Matelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to prepare for new elections.
A commission was set up in response to Martelly's handling of the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The triggering of some violent resistance movements was because several elections had not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating have been reported, with a total of 6 fires occurring and 4 people sustaining minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they were aware of 27 incidents related to this equipment.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) announced that an additional 34 cases of overheating incidents, which Apple described as "not serious," were reported.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry retorted to Apple's report release delay by saying it was "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency stated that no national damage has been reported.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, taking Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M-16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and it has been confirmed that at least six people have died.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, just like the Filipino photographers.
Later, when the elderly lady needed to go to the bathroom, the photographers took her place. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a path in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Donghan Riggins, who works at a hospital, began researching preterm labor in his free time.
His research showed that the rate of fetal lung maturation accelerated when hormones were administered.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, known as "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Other fellow wrestling athletes also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was also my first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Just as special as she was. She was a strong woman.'"
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Ahead of the 2010 federal election, a survey conducted on 1,400 people showed that the proportion opposing Australia's transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued that Australia should become a republic once Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
In the poll, 34 percent expressed the opinion that they wished Elizabeth II would be the last monarch of Australia.
According to a survey, 29 percent of respondents think that Australia should quickly become a republic, while 31 percent of respondents believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and participate in the Commonwealth Games relay, but there was concern about a possible decline in strength due to illness.
The drugs needed to overcome the pain were banned substances in the competition, so I couldn't take them.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri State University, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials that make up proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because a comet collided with Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his term earlier this year and signed a same-sex marriage legalization bill last month.
He referred to the rumor as "political chatter and foolishness."
He is speculated to run for president in the 2016 election.
According to the FAA's claims, NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike the previous use of ground-based radar technology, this employs satellite-based technology, allowing air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with very high accuracy and provide more precise information to pilots.
Additional transportation services will not be provided at Wembley, nor will ground trains stop, and ground parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available.
Due to concerns about insufficient public transportation, it has become more likely that the game will be held privately without spectators.
A study published in the Science magazine last Thursday announced that a new species of bird has formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Despite researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reporting a new species that evolved in just two generations, it is believed that this process took much longer due to breeding between the native bird of the region, the Darwin finches, medium ground finches, and the migrant cactus finches and large cactus finches from outside.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be cut with a thin line, bent, or twisted. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
"Gold can be made very thin and can be applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was also used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called 'illuminated manuscripts.'"
This is called the pH of a chemical substance, and an indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in a tested chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has been stripped of an electron. (Since a hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron)
After stirring the two dry powders together, squeeze them into a ball with clean hands dampened with water.
The moisture from the hands reacts with the outer layer to provide an interesting texture and form a sort of skin.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had flush toilets connected to elaborate sewer systems in almost every house.
Remains of sewage facilities have been discovered in houses of Santorini and Minoan cities in Crete, Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths that men and women used together.
If you are talking to someone thousands of kilometers (miles) away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive signals and reflect them back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
To install artificial satellites or telescopes in space, a super-large rocket over 100 feet is required.
The wheel has transformed the world in remarkable ways. The biggest change is that it has provided us with more convenient and faster means of transportation.
It brought trains, cars, and various modes of transportation.
Below that, there are medium-sized felines that hunt medium-sized animals such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Lastly, there are many smaller cats (including released pet cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of targeting a niche, a special role each cat holds that prevents competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social members of the cat family, living in groups.
A group consists of 1 to 3 adult males of the same species and up to 30 females and their young.
Females typically come from large families with many sisters and daughters, so they have close relationships with each other.
A pride of lions behaves in a way that is remarkably similar to a pack of wolves or dogs (but different from other large feline animals), which can be extremely deadly to their prey.
Tigers are like versatile athletes, as they can climb to high places, swim, and leap long distances (though not exceptionally well), and they have the strength to pull five times more than a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four feline animals are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is different from the mighty roar of a lion, but it is similar to a sentence made up of growling and shouting words.
Ocelots enjoy eating small animals. When possible, they mainly hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds that are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and find animals (prey) to eat, by sniffing where they have been.
An ocelot has bright nocturnal vision, allowing it to see well in the dark, and it can move very cautiously. An ocelot hunts by ambushing its prey while blending into its surroundings.
When a small group of organisms (a small number of individuals) becomes isolated from the main population they spread out from (moving across a mountain range or river, or relocating to a new island where movement is not easy), they often realize that they are in an environment different from where they were before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors than before, so in order for the new population to have strong competitiveness, it requires different characteristics or adaptation methods than before.
Although the original population hasn't changed at all, the same kind of adaptation as before is still necessary.
As time passed and new people began to adapt to the new environment, they gradually started to appear different from others.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups would look so different that they would no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which refers to the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and is a crucial part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food through photosynthesis using the sun, and they also provide shade.
We build houses with wood and make clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetables. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Since Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, it had nothing to fear except other Mosasauruses.
The elongated jaw was filled with over 70 very sharp teeth, and these teeth were additionally on the roof of the mouth. This means that anyone passing in front of it would not be able to escape.
It is not certain, but its tongue might have been forked. It preyed on turtles, large fish, and other Mosasaurs, and it might have even eaten human flesh.
This animal also attacked everything that came into the water, to the extent that even gigantic dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus could not withstand it.
Their food is generally familiar to us, but among the ingredients for Roman banquets were unusual and strange ones, such as boar, peacock, snails, and rodents like dormice.
Another difference is that poor people and women sat in chairs to eat food, whereas wealthy men preferred to recline leisurely on their sides while sharing a banquet together.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they could not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians constructed a main temple for all the gods they believed in, considering it a "house of the gods."
People would have brought offerings to the gods, and the priests would have tried to meet the gods' demands through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only the clergy were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, often called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The very top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not that important.
The life of a Hebrew family was mostly conducted outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard, the shops were just street vendors who had set up stalls, and the stones were used to build houses.
Because there were no large forests in Canaan, wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. The Norwegian saga says that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. And when he sailed further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discoveries, the Eskimo tribe was already residing there at that time.
Each country was part of 'Scandinavia,' but there were many differences in the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even if something is written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
The back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence has the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" written on it. These words are written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows who recorded it, but this large parchment document (75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was stored rolled up initially.
Therefore, it is highly likely that it was simply labeled as such.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was under the control of 'Vichy' France. These were the French who chose to make peace with Germany in 1940, collaborating with the invaders rather than fighting against them."
On August 15, 1944, the Allied forces invaded southern France, and this invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning their advance toward Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a very large group of people, that is, a society, where people work and live cooperatively.
The word "civilization" is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning 'citizen-like', civis, meaning 'citizen', and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it defines the scale of a society.
City-states can be considered pioneers of the nation. Civilization culture signifies the transmission of knowledge across generations, the remnants of cultural footprints, and the fair distribution of culture.
Many minority cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not regarded as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first formed a central government under the Articles of Confederation, which was not very powerful and had Congress as its only component.
Because Congress did not have the authority to levy taxes and there was no national executive or judiciary, they often had to rely on uncooperative state authorities to enforce laws.
Additionally, the legislature had no authority to nullify state tax laws and tariffs.
These provisions could only be amended with unanimous consent from all states, and most of the state representatives, disregarding the central government, did not attend the meeting.
The Italian national football team is ranked as the second most successful team globally alongside the German national football team, and they won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, baseball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing, among others.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and sometimes Italian athletes participate in international competitions or the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest island being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the clusters/groups of islands that Japan possesses, from a geographical standpoint, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan began being called Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island, by passing European sailors in the 15th century.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern region of Taiwan, bringing about changes in grain production methods and beginning to produce rice and sugar through plantation agriculture by employing Chinese workers.
In 1683, the army of the Qing Dynasty (1644~1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as the territory of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894~1895) in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, allowing Japan to govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can better understand their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common still image photo format in the world is 35 mm, which was the film size mainly used towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced to this day. However, the more important point is that its aspect ratio has been inherited as the image sensor format of digital cameras.
It's a bit confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is called 3:2.
Several common formats (e.g., APS format) have this aspect ratio or are very similar.
The Rule of Thirds, often overused and frequently ridiculed, is a simple guideline that maintains order in an image while creating dynamism.
This rule specifies that the most effective position to place the main subject is at the points where lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church had become wealthy and powerful and was thoroughly investigated.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European countries as a religion regardless of differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affects everyone from kings to commoners.
According to one of the main doctrines of Christianity, wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the financial funds of the church exist primarily for such reasons.
The core power of the Church remained in Rome for over a thousand years. This concentration of power and wealth raised questions about whether this doctrine was justified.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although these blockades violated international law generally accepted by several international agreements over the past two centuries, this strategy has proven effective in cutting off important military and civilian supplies.
The UK mined the high seas to prevent any vessels from entering various maritime zones as a whole, posing a risk even to neutral ships.
Because there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response in unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing tendencies among most citizens and countries were pacifism and isolationism.
Through the First World War, countries that experienced the horrors and atrocities of a past life prayed that they would never face such situations again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States to get a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with a letter of recommendation addressed to Thomas Edison written by Charles Batchelor, his former manager, a poetry book, and his entire wealth of 4 cents.
In ancient China, there were unique methods to denote different eras, and each period or ruling family in China was distinguished as a dynasty.
Additionally, there were unstable periods of division into various regions between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which corresponds to the 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During this period, fierce wars broke out among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people fighting and dying to sit on the highest throne in Xi'an.
The use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, and the emergence of the idea that nationalism and nationhood are owned by many people rather than a single ruler, have had significant influences on social and political aspects.
In addition, after the revolution, careers were opened to all male applicants, paving the way for the most ambitious and success-oriented individuals to succeed.
Because ranks based on current capability indicators are used instead of military ranks according to social class, the same method is applied to the military.
Moreover, the French Revolution inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start revolutions on their own.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He often used the cave known as 'Hira' on Mount 'Noor (light)' for meditation.
The cave weathered by the passage of time clearly reveals Muhammad's religious inclinations.
This cave, located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if there are people who know about its existence, finding it is not easy. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
All that can be seen is the clear and beautiful sky surrounding the mountain. From inside this cave, the outside world cannot be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
Built in the 3rd century BC by the Egyptians, 'the Great Pyramid' is one of many enormous pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), multiple small tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to commemorate Khufu's wife and family.
The "ascending circumflex" symbol looks like a V-shape, and the "descending circumflex" symbol looks like a staple or a square without a bottom side.
Raising the bow refers to drawing the bow from the end of the string, while lowering the bow means starting from the bow grip (the part where the bow is held) and drawing the bow.
While upward bowing usually produces a softer sound, downward bowing creates a stronger and more confident sound.
You may make your own marks with a pencil, but the bow marks that are drawn are there for musical purposes and should usually be followed.
The terrified King Louis XVI of France, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), along with the king's sister, Princess Élisabeth, were forcibly transferred from Versailles to Paris by a group of female workers on October 6, 1789.
The king and queen returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by crowds shouting and threatening them.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a member of the mob shook the head of the murdered royal guard captain in front of the terrified queen at the Palace of Versailles.
The cost of the war of American imperialism used for the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a significant portion of their expenses, and bonds in the name of the Philippine government attracted interest through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute a fundamental interest of American imperialism.
To understand the Templar Order, one must know the motive that led to the creation of the order.
The era when the incident occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, corresponding to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) in European history.
The High Middle Ages, which precede the Late Middle Ages and connect with the Early Middle Ages, are conventionally considered to end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of substantial thoughts, from technology orientation or technological obligation to the precise meaning that human destiny is driven by the fundamental logic related to expressions in scientific laws and technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two concepts. One is that the development of technology itself shows more influence than culture or politics, and the other is that technology is not socially controlled but rather exerts an inherent "influence" on society.
For example, someone might argue that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable with only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Additionally, when many people own vehicles, the rate of road accidents increases, which in turn leads to the development of new technologies in the medical services field to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism possessed many elements of cultural determinism influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
From the perspective of Romanticism, geography has shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography have developed, achieving social harmony, which was ultimately better than arbitrarily creating and imposing laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern era, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital during feudal Europe.
The reputation as the origin of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, the status of Constantinople declined mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk or spices that were more valuable than the goods sold in the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the fashion capital changed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the early days, dresses were greatly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because the exchange of information was slow, Western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, one of the biggest developments at the time was that people started fastening their clothes with buttons.
Subsistence agriculture is farming carried out to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple yet organic system that uses indigenous seeds of the ecological region through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and it is still prevalent in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together similar people who feel alienated from social norms, allowing them to foster their own identity.
A subculture can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that clearly distinguish a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, and geographical elements, and it may be a combination of these elements.
Members of subcultures often express their sense of belonging through a unique and symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and specific slang.
One of the most common ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is by using cases of a few unfortunate children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse while growing up, were not socialized by adults.
These children are called 'feral children.' Some feral children are also confined, often by their parents. In some cases, this kind of child abandonment occurs because the parents cannot accept the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
A feral child may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some children are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When completely raised by animals rather than humans, a feral child exhibits behaviors almost entirely akin to those of animals requiring special care, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, and scaffolding takes it one step further.
Scaffolding can be considered more of an aid than a learning method. It provides assistance to those learning something new, such as using the latest computer programs or starting a new project.
A scaffold can be both virtual and real, and in other words, a teacher is a form of a scaffold but could also be the little paperclip person from Microsoft Office.
The virtual structure is embedded in the software and is intended to question, raise, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
The reasons for a child entering foster care range widely, from neglect and abuse to even abduction.
Every child should grow up in a nurturing, protective, and educational environment, but that is not the situation.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system will provide a safe home, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical benefits.
Foster care must be able to provide all the essential elements that were not met in the existing home.
The internet encompasses both elements of collective communication and interpersonal communication.
A distinct characteristic of the internet leads to an additional dimension in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been presented as important motives for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) investigated audience responses to websites and identified 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationship' as new motivational aspects.
By using video recording, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by accurately interpreting subtle facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech," noted that despite being unable to understand the speech due to brain damage, people accurately perceived the sincerity contained within it.
He even suggested that animals like pets also possess this ability to analyze human behavior.
According to research from the 20th century, there are two groups of genetic variations that are either hidden or revealed.
Mutations create genes of new species, and selection removes the expressed genes from the pool.
Separation and recombination shuffle the variations between the two gene pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for primates, which have digestive systems similar to humans, to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, its failure leads to serious consequences such as impaired growth function, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources are the proteins from leaves or legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods like ants, termites, and eggs are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality protein containing essential amino acids.
Considering all the circumstances, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to regain consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you turn off the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place the clock in a far corner of the room so that you have to get out of bed yourself to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include consuming large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, which is well-known as a diuretic) before bed to force urination.
The amount of composure a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of anxiety inherent in their body and soul.
The less you stress, the more positive energy will emerge in life. Everyone has the ability to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle that stands in the way of this goal is our inner anxiety and negative tendencies.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has expanded upon the concept of love from Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is theoretically very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Practicing Kundalini Yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Visualizing various deities helps to cleanse energy channels, activate chakras, and create an enlightened consciousness.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, changes, and cultures led to the decline of several nations.
As the two years since the end of the war passed, former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
The Cold War was to last for the next 40 years and become actual battles fought by proxy forces on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other regions.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead to regroup.
However, these plans became almost overnight obsolete when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded Eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties (both bilateral and multilateral), and entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, where they were established.
Transporting goods using ships is the most efficient way to move many people and large quantities of goods across the sea.
The mission of the navy is traditionally to ensure that the nation can transport people and goods efficiently, while at the same time holding the mission to disrupt the transport of people and goods by adversaries.
One of the most notable recent cases was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move manpower and resources across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which primarily used U-boats, tried to block this operation.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany could have conquered England just like the rest of Europe.
Goat herding appears to have begun around ten thousand years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Livestock goats are generally found in herds on hills or grazing areas, and are mostly cared for by goat herders, who are usually children or adolescents and are more commonly known as shepherds. This method of livestock farming is still used today.
Carriageways were constructed in England in the early 16th century.
The carriageway was made merely of parallel wooden planks, but nevertheless, it allowed horses to travel at faster speeds and pull more loads compared to the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to fix the tracks. However, it gradually became evident that it was more efficient for the tracks to rest on steel sleepers.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the carriage to wear out more.
As time passed, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. And finally, in 1767, a railway made entirely of iron was introduced.
The earliest mode of transportation known to humanity was walking, and with the appearance of Homo erectus two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright like they do.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs about 7 million years ago, but well-documented evidence of bipedalism is found in the fossils of Australopithecus, which appeared 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago.
We can start living a more eco-friendly life and participate in environmental movements. Also, we can become activists to somewhat reduce the suffering we will face in the future.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, to avoid merely a temporary fix, the root of the problem must be identified and deactivated.
It is quite evident that the world has changed significantly due to the advancement of human science and technology, and the problems have worsened due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, John Hancock, the President of Congress, and Charles Thomson, the Secretary, signed a handwritten document and sent it a few blocks away to the John Dunlap printing house.
Between 150 and 200 copies of a print, now known as the 'Dunlap Broadside,' were made that night.
The first public reading of this document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8th in the front yard of the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist, this document is the oldest surviving copy. The handwritten original no longer exists.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and continues to exist to this day. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider birds as dinosaurs because birds have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many things that make birds look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
Most computers used today operate by manipulating information through binary coding.
A binary number can only have one of two values (i.e., 0 or 1), and these numbers are referred to in computer terminology as binary numbers or bits.
Internal poisoning symptoms may not appear immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are too common to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The most certain sign of poisoning may be if you see a container of medicine or toxic household chemicals left open.
Please check the table for specific first aid guidelines for a particular poison.
The term "bug" is a formal term used by entomologists to refer to this type of insect.
This term is derived from bedbugs, insects that have long been known to be very suitable for parasitizing people.
Both the oriental chinch bug and bedbug are chronic insects that adapt to the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults, has approximately 400,000 cases reported across the United States.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
A study has found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not the best for each other or for the benefit of the child.
These couples may choose to adopt a baby.
In the adoption process, biological parents relinquish parental rights so that another couple can take in and raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This approach guides most scientific research.
However, an experiment is about eliminating one or more hypotheses, asking questions, making observations, and leading to scientific research.
Natural historians and philosophers focused particularly on classical texts and the Latin Bible.
In science, including psychology, Aristotle's views on all matter were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior critically depend on the presence of productivity and endogenous cycles through biological clocks.
In most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, cyclical rhythms are recorded that are not merely responses to external cyclical signals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that can continue its cycle on its own even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading studies that proposed DNA as the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant bacteria with their own DNA.
They conducted two experiments: one to identify the DNA within the phage when there was radioactive phosphorus, and the other to identify the protein of the phage when there was radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, and mutations elsewhere may lead to cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature is attracting people interested in exploring nature for the purpose of appreciating landscapes that include plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and research on parks and ecosystems.
Borneo’s orangutans, in terms of travel, photography, and learning, are one example.
Every morning, people leave their small rural village by car to go to work, passing by others heading to the workplace they just left.
This dynamic shuttle transport connects and supports everyone in some way with a transportation system based on personal vehicles.
Scientific data now shows that this huge carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, there are hardly any complaints at a similar level about water quality issues or bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system cause such dissatisfaction, and why does it fail to meet expectations every day? Are all the transportation engineers incompetent, or is there something more fundamental at play?
The term "traffic flow" refers to the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within fairly consistent ranges. Therefore, traffic flow has a reasonable degree of consistency and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established among the three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals that could fly in the air. The ability to fly helped insects evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of smaller places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus argued that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some believed he was right in claiming that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth, but many also did not believe him.
Doesn't it seem true at first glance because the Earth feels as if it isn't moving?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the largest by volume. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching a width of 6 miles.
20% of the water flowing from the Earth's rivers into the sea comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. This basin is formed by the confluence of thousands of small rivers.
Pyramid construction continued until the last moments of the ancient kingdom, but neither the size nor the technical excellence could ever surpass that of the Giza Pyramids.
The ancient New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monumental structures of their ancestors, which by their time were well over 1,000 years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the one with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
Furthermore, unlike Latin, which is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language spoken by most people working in the region.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they can all be found in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle theorized that all substances are composed by mixing one or more of four elements. The four elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, this resembled the four states of matter—solid, liquid, gas, and plasma (in that order)—but Aristotle also developed the theory that they transform into new pure substances to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, metals like silver and gold also exist.
There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metals like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so several trillion atoms could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil appeared and remained a good tool for many people.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing have emerged, pencils have been used less frequently and have been pushed to a less important position.
Nowadays, people have no need to write messages on computer screens and keep a pencil sharpener nearby.
People are simply wondering about what will happen to the keyboard if something new emerges.
The nuclear fission bomb is based on the principle that a lot of energy is required to combine nuclei that have many protons and neutrons.
It is like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. When the nucleus is split again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split on their own with very little external influence or even without any external conditions.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called "the crust."
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
The crust is thinner beneath the sea and thicker under the plateau.
Because the crust is thinner, there may be more maria on the nearer side. It is a condition where it is easier for lava to rise above the surface.
Content theory focuses on what motivates people to perform certain behaviors or leads them to act.
These theories suggest that people have certain internalized desires or needs by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories examine specific people who want to do what they do and what about their environment makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally, two behaviors can appear as a manager begins to lead former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum, they try to remain 'one of the employees.'"
This type of manager makes decisions that are not welcomed by people, disciplines, evaluates work, assigns responsibilities, and finds it difficult to hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, there are unaware individuals who think they need to change everything the team has been doing and make it their own way.
Ultimately, the success or failure of the team is the responsibility of the leader.
Such behavior causes confusion between the active leader and members.
A virtual team maintains the same standards of excellence as a traditional team, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for real members.
They often have more autonomy than existing team members because they can meet with teams according to changing time zones that the local management team does not understand.
The existence of a true "transparent team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"The "invisible team" is a management team that each member reports to. This team sets standards for each member."
Why do organizations go through a lengthy process to establish learning groups? One of the goals of implementing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
If all available resources are used efficiently in the organization's work departments, creativity and originality can be demonstrated.
As a result, the process of the organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organization to become innovative, leadership must create not only an innovative culture but also shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes an approach called Continuum as a way to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides the necessary physical evidence when a theoretical approach is taken to the study of cognitive abilities. This narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
With the advent of new technology, it has become possible to observe and investigate brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides a lot of information and data for creating simulation models that help us understand mental processes.
AI powerfully evokes science fiction, but constitutes a very important field in computer science, dealing with computer behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research includes the study of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior by machines.
For example, it includes functions such as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition, as well as control, planning, scheduling, customer diagnosis, and answering questions.
These have become a separate discipline focused on providing solutions to problems that occur in real life.
AI systems are frequently used in current economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as seen in various home computer and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. Generally, teachers want to take their students to places that do not require a bus trip.
Technology assists with virtual field trips. Students can view museum exhibits, explore aquariums, and appreciate beautiful artworks while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual field trips are a great way to reflect on field trips and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about the state capital trip. Each year, the website is remodeled, and the previous version is retained in the form of a scrapbook on an online server.
Blogs also help improve students' writing. Students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of readers generally changes that.
Since most students are the most critical audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
"Additionally, blogs make students smart and interesting through the necessity of attracting the audience's attention by 'encouraging students to pay more attention to their surroundings' (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that fosters cooperation and encourages students to expand their learning beyond traditional school life.
"Appropriate use of blogs actively responds to internet resources, enhancing students' analytical and critical thinking, allowing them to define their stance from others' writings and establish their own perspective on specific topics (Oravec, 2020)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, and the various art galleries and museums in Ottawa highlight Canada's past and present.
In the southernmost part, there is Niagara Falls, and in the northern part, there is a hometown of untouched natural beauty such as Muskoka.
All of these things are what outsiders consider the true Canada, which makes Ontario stand out.
The vast northern region is sparsely populated, and some areas are almost uninhabited wastelands.
A surprising population comparison for many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than the entire population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest and most unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent nations or associated with France, and are known for luxurious beach resorts.
Islam was also spread through the Arabs, bringing significant changes in the Comoros and Mayotte regions.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route connecting Europe to India.
The north is bordered by the Sahel, and the south and west are bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Female: We recommend that all women travelers answer that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring helps too (it's best to avoid rings that look expensive).
Women should be aware that due to cultural differences, actions such as grabbing an arm, which might result in being considered harassment, are not uncommon.
Do not be afraid to firmly reject men and stand your ground (whether it's a cultural difference or not, harassment cannot be overlooked!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
After the Portuguese destroyed this place, they rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco reconstructed the city known as Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish traders who established a trading post there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least exciting shopping destinations in Morocco.
In the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various other items, but they are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located near Rwanda, on the eastern side of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava that erupted from the Nyiragongo volcano, burying most of the roads in towns, including those in the city center.
Though Goma is relatively safe, those visiting Goma from outside should conduct research to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu region.
Additionally, this city also serves as the base camp for the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking and the Nyiragongo volcano climb in Africa.
You can get around Goma using Boda-Boda (motorbike taxis). The standard (local) fare is 500 Congolese Francs for short-distance rides.
By combining the meaning of relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor village, but because of its reputation, it has become a tourist attraction and also has an airport.
Due to the impact of desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
This was one of the most significant exploration sites in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special 'Wonders of Africa.'
This city is in stark contrast to other cities in Mali because it has more Arab influences than African ones.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, with Mozambique to the east and forming along the border with Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park encompasses an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct zones, each supporting different wildlife.
This place is one of the landmarks of South Africa and is the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, the park has a daily conservation fee and entrance fee.
It might be beneficial to purchase a wild card that grants access to either a specific park in South Africa or all the national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the place that gave the name Hong Kong to the territory and is a focal point for many tourists.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline is often compared to a sparkling bar graph because of the way they are vividly reflected on the surface of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most spectacular views of Hong Kong, leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong's outlying area development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This place was owned by British colonial developers, so if you're looking for evidence of past colonial territories, it's good to start here.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast across Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A portion of this forest that falls within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not just a mere mangrove swamp. Part of the last remains of the great jungle that once covered the Ganges Plain is found here.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², about one-third of which is covered by water and marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer in this area.
Buses operate all day at the intercity bus terminal across the river, but buses heading specifically to Dongbu and Jakarta/Bumtang depart only between 06:30 and 07:30.
Intercity buses are often fully booked, so it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
In most areas, comfortable and sturdy small Japanese-made Coaster buses are in operation.
Shared taxis are a means to travel quickly and comfortably to nearby areas such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. This bridge connects the Oyapock River with the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two main towers is 83 meters, the length of the bridge is 378 meters, and there are two lanes each with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters, the construction was completed in August 2011, and the closure of the bridge is until March 2017.
This bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoint is completed.
The Guarani people are the most important indigenous tribe, residing in the current eastern Paraguay, and they were a semi-nomadic hunting tribe that also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
The emergence of Paraguay, known as "The Giant of the Indies," in the 16th century is the result of encounters between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely maintained its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having the world's best polo teams and players.
The largest tournament match of the year is held in December at the La Canitas Polo Stadium.
During other times of the year, it is also possible to watch smaller tournaments and matches here.
For news about tournament matches and to find out where to purchase tickets for polo matches, please check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is set at par with one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the island's only bank located at Stanley, directly across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the island, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars can also generally be used as alternatives.
In the designated library area, British and American currencies can be used, but credit cards cannot be. Please check with the owner in advance to determine what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency off the island, so make sure to exchange it before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing winter, and the opposite is also true.
Montevideo is a subtropical region. In the summer, the temperature usually exceeds 30°C.
Winter can get unbelievably chilly. Although it's rare for temperatures to drop below freezing, the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the actual temperature.
The "rainy season" and "dry season" do not particularly exist separately. The precipitation level is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife retains its wild nature and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how easy they may seem to handle, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can be aggressive.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured due to failing to maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so please keep a safe distance.
Additionally, since smells can attract bears or other wildlife, you should keep the camp clean by not carrying or cooking fragrant foods.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was a famous naval standoff location in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor.
All ships except for one British cruiser were sunk. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the period of struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the village resulted in the death of the top chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland stretches across two harbors, it has many beaches. The most popular ones are within three areas.
The North Shore beach (North Harbour area) faces the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It is almost entirely a sandy beach where it is safe to swim, and most beaches have plenty of shaded areas created by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in the Waitemata Harbour in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers, in the Auckland city center.
These beaches are usually uncrowded family beaches, with a variety of shops lined up along the coast. It is a safe place for swimming.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not complex in flavor but is a pleasantly refreshing beer. Another local beer is 'Manta'.
While there are many French wines you should try, wines from New Zealand and Australia also easily come overseas.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you have concerns, bottled water is easily available.
The concept of 'flat white' coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. A short black is 'espresso', a cappuccino is piled high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate follows Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but very delicious.
Although many people travel to this coral reef area throughout the year, injuries from these kinds of causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should listen to the advice of the officials, follow all the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and river mouths from October to April. During this period, they are sometimes found outside.
Sharks do indeed exist, but it is very rare for them to attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the sea and mainly inhabit the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides travelers with peace of mind knowing they have somewhere to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have special offers for certain hotels, but it is also possible to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites, through them.
Travel agency staff usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport pickup/transportation, and sometimes flights and hotels.
Additionally, if additional time is needed to make a decision or to obtain other documents (e.g., visa) for the destination, holds can be placed on reservations for the customer.
However, if you have any modifications or requests, please do not contact the hotel directly, but proceed with them through the travel agency first.
At several festivals, many people attending music festivals decide to camp on-site, and most attendees consider camping a must-experience activity.
If you want to stay close to the fun and excitement, you need to get in early to secure a campsite near the music.
Although the performance on the main stage may end, don't forget that music can still be played in various places throughout the festival until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, it is advisable to check the location of your room, as crossing the ice creates quite a terrible noise.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (please check the terms and conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of efforts to maximize the time and money guests spend. Usually, there are no windows and clocks, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They always have special food, drinks, and entertainment available so that visitors can stay longer and maintain a good atmosphere.
In some places, alcohol is provided for free. However, since alcohol can cloud judgment, all good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
When planning to drive over high altitudes or mountain roads, you should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On roads covered with ice and snow, friction is reduced so you cannot drive properly as if you were on bare asphalt.
When a blizzard blows, a lot of snow can fall in an instant, leaving you stranded.
Additionally, visibility may be limited due to falling and scattered snow, raindrops, or frost on vehicle windows.
In contrast, there are many countries where icy roads or snow-covered roads are common, and the roads are not blocked for most of the year.
A safari is perhaps the most magnificent tourist attraction in Africa and will be a highlight for many visitors.
The widely known expression "safari" refers specifically to an overland journey to see the magnificent African wildlife of the savanna.
Some animals like elephants or giraffes tend to approach cars closely and can be well observed using standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be shy, so they can be observed better with the use of binoculars.
Hiking safari (also known as "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of hikes that can last for several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in various regions across Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964, will become the only city in Asia to have held the Summer Olympics twice.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, a somewhat complicated situation could arise.
The refund policies vary, but as of the end of March, the refund policies due to the coronavirus have mostly not been extended until the Olympic period in July 2020.
Most event ticket prices range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with the average ticket price being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent, even if they are not provided in the guest rooms.
You may not have an iron, or you may not like wearing ironed socks. In this case, if you have a hair dryer, there is a way to use it.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as it may shrink or scorch).
There are other methods of purifying water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient. In other areas, it is necessary to boil the water for several minutes.
Water filters vary in their effectiveness. If there are concerns about water quality, it is recommended to purchase and drink bottled water from reputable brands.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not common in their own region.
Pests can cause food to rot and induce inflammation, or in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infectious diseases.
Epidemics themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping provides an opportunity to purchase products exempt from taxes and consumption tax in specific areas.
Travelers from countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially when buying alcohol or tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont, located in an isolated mountainous terrain, is known as one of the most difficult sections to drive on the Buffalo Pittsburgh Highway.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you should be cautious of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limit is noticeably lower than the prior and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and adhering to the speed limit within this section is much more important than in other sections.
Interestingly, cell phone service is much stronger here than at many other points along this route, such as Wise in Pennsylvania.

When it comes to Indonesian cuisine, it is a comprehensive term that encompasses the various regional dishes from the entire country, which consists of 17,000 islands.
However, if used more broadly without restriction, this term tends to refer to the food of the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
The widely available Javanese cuisine throughout the islands is characterized by a variety of simple seasonal dishes, and the main flavors favored by the Javanese include peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
A stirrup is a support for a rider's foot that hangs down on either side of the saddle.
This device provides much more stability to the rider, but there may be safety issues because the feet can get caught.
If a person riding a horse falls off and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, there is a risk of being dragged away if the horse runs off. To minimize this danger, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots that have heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly British saddles, have a safety bar from which the stirrup leather can detach from the saddle if a rider falls and pulls backward.
Cochamó Valley - Known as the Yosemite Valley of South America, it is Chile's premier climbing area with a variety of large granite walls and rock mountains.

Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
A ski trip is a way of traveling enjoyed by enthusiasts called "ski bums." These people plan their vacation schedule as a time to ski continuously at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to as early as 5000 BC.
As a sport, downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was established by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This activity is related to alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, but usually does not include them. In the latter case, it takes place on steep terrain and requires much stronger skis and boots.
Think of a ski course as a similar hiking course.
Under good conditions, you can go slightly farther than walking. However, without a well-maintained track and without a heavy backpack, you won't achieve the speed equivalent to cross-country skiing.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Typically, traveling to multiple countries means having to go through visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
However, in this regard, the Schengen zone (an area with free border movement) functions somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without going through the passport control again.
Similarly, holding a Schengen visa eliminates the need to apply for visas individually for each Schengen member country, thereby reducing time, cost, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of an antique. In some tax regions, items that are more than 100 years old are classified as antiques.
Compared to Europe, North America shows a geographical distinction where the age considered as antique is shorter.
Although handcrafted products may not be as old as mass-produced similar products, they can be defined as antiques.
Reindeer husbandry is one of the important livelihoods for the Sami people, and such culture holds significant meaning for many others involved in trade as well.
Traditionally, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but most raised reindeer as draught animals while living off activities like fishing or hunting.
Nowadays, many Sami people are engaged in modern trade. The tourism industry is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sami people.

Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are hardly any publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have the valid documents when returning home.
Whether a passport is issued without specifying gender (X) or whether documents are updated according to the desired name and gender varies by government.
The willingness to accept such documents from foreign governments also varies greatly.
Since September 11, 2001, security checkpoint inspections have also become much more annoying.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery should not expect that their privacy and dignity will remain intact when passing through a scanner.
Rip currents are ocean currents that often return from waves breaking against reefs or similar objects on the beach.
Due to the systematic classification within the water, reduced water concentrates in certain depths, allowing the formation of rapid currents to deep water in these areas.
In most cases, [swimmers] become exhausted and perish while trying to swim against currents that are largely impossible to overcome.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back as usual isn't that difficult.
It might be wise to aim for a place where you won't get caught up in the currents again, or depending on your swimming ability or whether you've been spotted by others, it may be best to wait for rescue.
The re-entry shock can occur more quickly than culture shock as there is no honeymoon phase, it can last longer, and be more intense.
Travelers who have experienced little difficulty adapting to new cultures often have an especially hard time readjusting to their native culture.
When living abroad and returning to one's home country, people often show signs of having adapted to another country's culture while simultaneously losing some habits of their own culture.
When you first went abroad, most people would have treated you with patience and understanding because they know that travelers have to adapt to a new country.
People may not think that patience and understanding are necessary for travelers on their way back home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the things that most captures the interest of children in this area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and also see them in the tranquility before the show begins.

Scenes were projected onto the pyramids, and lights were lit on other pyramids.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries, and in 2020, with activities from 16 countries, they have the most bases.
This archipelago is located about 120 km north of the Antarctic Peninsula, with the largest settlement being Villa Las Estrellas on King George Island.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, which are formed by still active volcanoes and offer a stunning natural harbor with a water-filled caldera.
Ellsworth Land is located to the south of the peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on this peninsula form a 360 km band of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are bisected by the Minnesota Glacier, after connecting to the plateau and re-emerging.
In the northern region or the Sentinel Range, there is the Vinson Massif, the highest mountain in Antarctica, with a height of 4,892 meters.
In remote areas outside the range of mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only alternative.
Satellite phones usually cannot replace mobile phones because they need to be used in places outdoors where there is a direct line of transmission and reception to the satellite.
This service is frequently used in places that require maritime transport, including recreational vessels, and remote data and voice services.
You may be able to receive more information regarding access to this service from your local telecommunications provider.
More and more people are using their gap year for travel and study.
This is especially popular among graduates, as it does not impose a heavy academic burden and allows them to take a year off during their studies.
In most cases, enrolling in an overseas gap-year course can actually increase the likelihood of pursuing higher education in one's home country.
Generally, there is a tuition fee for enrolling in such educational programs.
"Finland is a great destination for enjoying boating. The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos."
It is not always necessary to have a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and large lakes are big enough to be suitable for any yacht, riding a slightly smaller boat or even a kayak provides a unique experience.
In Finland, boating is such a national pastime that there is one boat for every 7 to 8 people.
This can be seen as a similar case in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but outside of these countries, it can be considered quite unusual (in New Zealand, it is one in every 40 people).
Certainly, most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit historic cities all day for around two days and return to the cruise ship at night to sleep.
If you go to the coast on a cruise trip, a separate visa is not required (since 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures, but as you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Taking a flight can be a frightening experience for everyone, regardless of age or gender. It can be especially shocking for those who have never flown before or are afraid of flying.
This is nothing to be ashamed of, and it is no different from personal fears and aversions that most people have about other things.
For some people, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear based on the unknown or the lack of control.
Courier companies receive substantial compensation for quickly delivering items. In cases such as business documents, products for urgent repairs, or spare parts, time is often of the essence.
Large corporations use their own aircraft on certain routes, but there are issues if it is a different route or for small businesses.
If it was sent by air cargo, it might take a few days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to expedite the process was to send it as checked baggage. According to airline regulations, baggage cannot be sent without a passenger on board.
The surefire way to fly first class or business class is to pay a hefty wad of cash to enjoy the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it).
So it's not cheap. Rough estimates suggest you might have to pay up to four times the business class fare or even up to eleven times the first-class fare!
Generally, it is meaningless to seek seat discounts, whether in business class or first class, for direct flights from region A to region B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core passenger segment that is willing to pay a significant amount of money for fares set according to the privilege of getting to places quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.

All the animals that first arrived on the island did so by swimming, flying, or floating in the water.
Mammals, unlike the giant tortoises which are the primary grazers of the Galapagos, could not travel due to the great distance from the continent.
Many mammals, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs, arrived on the islands after humans reached the Galápagos.
If you visit the polar regions during the winter, you will experience the polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon.
