In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this also provides us with details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, known as a rachis, but have other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis probably developed later in evolutionary history compared to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but for temperature regulation and display. The researchers' position is that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen suggests that it is the feathers of an adult individual, not a juvenile.
The researchers stated that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult individual rather than chick down.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which relates to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of its magnetic reversal.

The work done is mostly of a theoretical nature, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was searching for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
By the same principle by which the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, the majority of the dark matter around the galaxy is situated around the galaxy in the form of a halo, and it is composed of numerous tiny particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is clear why this is so, considering these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the US Geological and Astrological Survey team and from Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally very simple in terms of technology: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place a printed ballot with the selected candidate marked in an envelope.
When the officials verify the voter's identity, he/she places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voters' list.
The electoral law of France very strictly codifies the protocol.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added other than those from duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In her second race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's seated category, with a combined race time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the sitting category did not finish their races, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not make it onto the race ranking list.
Police in Madhya Pradesh have found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped a Swiss woman and have retrieved her mobile and laptop."
The accused were named Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Inspector Chanda Sekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when it was hit by a car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
In the beginning, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja has since been charged in the sheriff court in Edinburgh with the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised given that her picture has been published in many media outlets.
This is common practice in other places in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted: "Journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish pictures of suspects or anything else."
The Scottish public prosecution, which generally has jurisdiction over criminal prosecution, told reporters that there will be no further comments at least until the indictment is raised.
According to leaked information, the document will pertain to the discussion about borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-Six-Day War borders of 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian authorities agree to that presence for only five years.
The shooters involved in the supplementary pest control action were supposed to be under strict supervision by rangers, as the action was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Thanks to the partnership between NPWS and a corporation named the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers have been engaged within the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters' Association.
According to Mike O'Flynn, acting director for park protection and heritage at the NPWS agency, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
The new electoral commission (CEP) of nine members was sworn in yesterday under Martelly.
It is Martel's fifth election commission in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the CEO as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martel's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests are caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPod devices have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four individuals.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the given devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "insignificant."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Marijana at 07:19 in the morning local time (09:19 in the evening on Friday GMT zone).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady since she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot down with a firearm.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to build a career in the field of medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that in the case of hormone application, the fetal maturation of the baby's lungs would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes," which contain flight records, on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two months. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as weird as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
In the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 and 200 meters freestyle in three relays at the "Commonwealth Games," but due to his complaints, there are doubts about his fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed for pain relief because they are banned at the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several individuals confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water that reached Earth along with organic material that can form proteins and enable life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets have collided with Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
Regarding the rumors, he said that they are "political chatter and nonsense."
It is being said publicly that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to earlier technologies based on ground-based radars, so that air traffic controllers can determine a more precise position of the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport placed on the overground trains will stop at Wembley, and parking and "park and ride" facilities are not available above ground.
The fear of lack of transportation has increased the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reports the creation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to the mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be processed into thin wire, which can be twisted or braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (considering that hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix those two dry powders together and then, with clean damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of the sewer system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in the same company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then sends it back down almost at the same moment.
The rocket sent a satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
Sending a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has enabled much easier and faster transportation.
That brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized game, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that prey on far more numerous small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a special role that each cat fulfills, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social among cats and live in large groups known as prides.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but more like a sentence full of growling, exclaimed words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and if they can, birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists think that ocelots track and seek animals to eat (prey) by scent, by smelling the spot on the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with the help of night vision, and they also move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment, and then they pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river or relocate to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than was previously required.
The original population hasn't changed at all, so they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it resembles the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide us with shade.
We make houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was a top predator of its time, and they feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set of teeth on the hard palate, meaning that nothing in his path could escape.
We cannot say for certain, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he might have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a huge dinosaur like T-Rex would not be his match.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some of their own strange or unusual things for feasting, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor men and women would eat their food sitting on chairs, the wealthy liked to organize banquets where they would recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to appease the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in front of the temple and an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
In the past, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The largest part of everyday life for a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the stores were merely open stalls facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that somewhere at the beginning of its creation this great document on parchment (its dimensions are 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Well, it is most likely that the label was added purely as a marking.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south still wasn't free.
It was led by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who, in 1940, reconciled with the Germans and joined forces with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated the south of France and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in cooperation, i.e., society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word civilis, which means civic, and is connected with the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which somehow also defines the size of a community.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, so they are often not recognized as true civilizations.
During the war for independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative in enforcing all its legal documents.
He also had no right to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
Unanimous approval from all states was necessary before the members could be amended, and the states took the central administration so lightly that their representatives were often absent from the sessions.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, was the second most successful team in the world and they were the winners of the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (of which the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical representations.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of this island as "Ilha Formosa," or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 - 1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, by which Japan gained sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photo format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
It is considered that the aspect ratio of this format is 3:2 (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest whole number ratio).
Many common formats (such as the APS family formats) are equal or nearly approximate to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and frequently mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while simultaneously maintaining a sense of order in the picture.
It states that the most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, oversight began to be exercised over the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful.
For thousands of years, the Christian religion has connected European states, despite differences in language and customs.
With her inexhaustible power, she influenced everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary funds of the church exist precisely for that reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
It has been shown that the strategy is effective, as it interrupted the flow of key military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire parts of the ocean, thereby posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the responses to this tactic were limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and war atrocities during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
To accept a job at the New York company Edison, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of portraying different time periods; each period of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous period of all was the epoch of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce warfare occurred between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the throne in the vast palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Following the revolution, occupations were also open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that were beyond his ordinary life. He would often go to contemplate in a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived various times, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is hard to find, even if someone knows it exists. After entering the cave, complete isolation occurs.
Nothing more can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the interior of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of the numerous large pyramidal structures that pay tribute to the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis at Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up arch" mark looks like a V, and the "down arch mark" resembles a paperclip or a square missing its bottom side.
"Up" means you should start at the top and push the bow, while "down" means to start from the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Raising the bow usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering the bow produces a stronger and more assertive one.
Feel free to write down your marks with a pencil, but remember that printed symbols of the staff are present for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two small children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to retreat to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women from the market.
They traveled back to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who were shouting and hurling threats directed at the king and queen.
The crowd ordered the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the mob was waving the head of a royal guardsman killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the citizens of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the costs and interest on securities that circulated on Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the enormous profit derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people represented the fundamental gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, and it is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The peak of the Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which officially ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development follows a path that is beyond cultural and political influences, and that in return, technology has its "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Nevertheless, the national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The mass ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher frequency of road accidents, which results in the development of new medical techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography would emerge, and they were, in accordance with the place in society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until around the year 1100.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned, bearing gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was precisely during this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th - 11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow channels of communication, styles in the West might lag behind by some 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of that era, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce enough food solely for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds, native to a given ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class affiliation, location, and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, which include fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to look back at some sad cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "brutal" or feral. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this type of child abandonment occurs because parents refuse to accept the child's severe intellectual and physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse in childhood or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are claimed to have been raised by animals; for others, it is said that they lived alone in the wilderness.
When fully raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to the behavior of the animals that took care of them, such as their fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, learning through the "scaffolding" system takes it a step further.
Metacognitive scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support mechanism that aids individuals as they go through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is actually a type of support, but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual supports are an integral part of the software and are meant to review, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to carry out on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it still happens.
We consider the foster care system a protective zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, continuous education, and reliable healthcare.
The family accommodation for children should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions regarding the uses and access to satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important purposes of using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eijmei and Mekord (1998), in their research on audience reactions to websites, identified "personal involvement" and "maintained connections" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that if you accurately interpret micro-expressions, you can detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks noted in his work "The President's Speech" that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even believes that such abilities in understanding human behavior might also be present in animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unhidden.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination influence the constant mixing of variations between the two gene pools in every generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive tract similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid needs from the plant sources available to it.
Even if this is not done, it can lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources most easily accessible were the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting them if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal-derived food (ants, termites, eggs) not only is easily digestible but also provides a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
When all is considered, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly afterward (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished with a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you reset the clock during sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only things standing in the way of this goal are our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they are expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of comprehensive love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened using yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures caused these two countries to fall into discord.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was planned to last 40 years, and the struggle would be real, through conflicts of smaller countries representing the interests of larger military powers, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, as well as in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.

Transoceanic shipping is by far the most efficient way to move a large number of people and a large quantity of goods across the ocean.
The traditional role of a navy has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to transport people and goods while simultaneously preventing the enemy from transporting their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and weapons across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, was attempting to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats are mainly kept in herds that roam the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goatherds who are usually children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Tracks for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling wagons to achieve higher speeds and haul greater loads than on the somewhat uneven roads of the time.
Railway sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron bar on top.
This has become an established practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the carts.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In the year 1767, rails made of solid iron were used for the first time.
The first known form of transportation was walking. Humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as is commonly thought.
The refinement of bipedalism is found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and extinguish them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancement of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
John Nixon was the first to publicly read this document, on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th and was read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
25 Dunlap's papers that are still known to exist are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original, which was handwritten, has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Practically all computers in use today are based on handling information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
It does not have to be immediately obvious that it is a case of internal poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open package of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both assassin bugs and common bugs are species that remain with their parents for a long time, adapted to living in the nest or the host's home.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have symptoms of MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples may choose to plan to adopt a baby.
During adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can be the child's parents.
The main task of science is to understand the way the world functions using the scientific method. This method actually governs the majority of scientific research.
However, experimenting is not the only thing, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observing also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly those of the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's conceptions of all scientific questions were respected, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many notable rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that are not merely responses to the periodic alternation of external influences have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a free-running period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the phage DNA with the help of radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with the help of radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of genetic material that is affected, and whether the cells affected are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the plant and animal wildlife.
Field activities include, for example: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural areas by car to go to their workplaces, passing by those whose workplace is exactly in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation process, everyone is somehow connected and supports the transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this high-carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and utilizes transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and why do they make mistakes every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid predators and to find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This provides them with a greater choice of different small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many also believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This sounds reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth by volume. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its occasional width of six miles.
A full twenty percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old by that time.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also an everyday language used by the majority of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people were familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native form and can be relatively easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, had a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of just one or a few of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This more resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although it was also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are actually mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that consist of a small amount of non-metals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
That is why the pen was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and used less frequently.
People now write messages on a computer screen, without ever having been near a typewriter.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will turn into when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's roughly like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The re-splitting of the nucleus then releases a certain amount of energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to disintegrate with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Thinner under the lunar sea, thicker under the hills.
Perhaps there are more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what motivates people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized while maturing into adults.
These theories study what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and which things from their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two forms of behavior can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
In the end, it is the leader who is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can meet according to time zones for which local management would not have understanding.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
"The 'Invisible Team' is a management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through a lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently utilized in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can come to the fore.
As a result, the process of organizing where people work together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. Consequently, this narrows the field of research, making it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports the claims of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and material for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI strongly connotes science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnostics and client inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence (AI) system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and for military purposes, given that it is embedded in several home computers and software applications for video games.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Often the teacher would like to take her students to places where travel by bus is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their class.
Virtual sharing of experiences from the trip is also a great way to reflect on the excursion and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School from North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. Each year, the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online so they can serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more resourceful regarding the world around them." The need to spark the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to online materials, students can define their own views in the context of others' texts, as well as present their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, and it boasts a wide range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven of the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this further highlights Ontario as something that foreigners fundamentally regard as Canadian.
Large areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or affiliated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely adopted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, since the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route from Europe to India via the Cape.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended to all female travelers to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be determined in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was also used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and even the Marinids as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Badi'a, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but all of this is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
Goma was destroyed in 2002 by the lava of Mount Nyiragongo, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the city center.
Although Goma is fairly safe, any visits outside of Goma should be thoroughly examined to understand the state of ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province.
This city is also a base from which to start the ascent of Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation places it among tourist attractions, and there is also an airport in it.
Due to the threat of desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
That was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stops while filming "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
This city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic than an African vibe.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to diverse wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the main attraction of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
Consideration should also be given to purchasing a wildcard, which allows entry into certain South African parks or into all national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong, and it is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The cluster of buildings making up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a dazzling bar chart, made evident by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To see Hong Kong in the best way, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of the urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
British colonizers took this place as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/ Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As intercity buses are often full, it is advised to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the district is served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Taxi sharing is a quick and comfortable way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge is 378 meters long with two lanes, each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned for the bridge to be fully opened for use in September 2017, when the completion of the customs checkpoints on the Brazilian side is expected.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in sustainable agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, which survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India," was established in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous native groups.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
You can also see smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
For all news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association (Asociacion Argentina de Polo).
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland pound (FRF), whose value is set equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West shop.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley by credit cards, while US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are probably not going to be accepted, although British currency and United States currency might be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; temperatures over 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity together create a feeling that it is much colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park management, keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, North American and European moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not maintain the appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has slightly fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has officially held the title of the capital of Samoa since 1959.
Luka was the site of a notorious naval conflict in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships, except for one British cruiser, were sunk. Almost two hundred American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Given that Auckland spans two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas:
The Northern Beaches (in the area of Northern Harbour) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most of them have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are in the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a rich array of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer "Number One" is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that are good to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
For Australians, "flat white espresso with milk" is an unfamiliar concept. A short black is an "espresso," a cappuccino comes generously topped with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but exceptional.
Throughout the year, numerous trips to the reef are organized, and injuries caused by any of the aforementioned reasons on the reef are rare.
However, heed the authorities' advice, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear close to beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of this timeframe.
There are sharks, however, they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away from you as far as possible.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance makes a traveler feel at ease knowing they will have a place to sleep upon reaching their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you might be able to book other forms of accommodation through them, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel arrangements.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or they can obtain other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (e.g. a visa).
Any amendment or request should first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have stopped, there might be parts of the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during winter, check the location of the cabin, considering that passing through the ice causes rather dreadful sounds for those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money visitors spend. There are generally no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to ensure they stay at the venue.
At some places, alcoholic beverages are served on the house. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or below-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is poor and you cannot drive as if you are on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, as well as fogging or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic generally proceeds without interruptions throughout the year.
A safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the experience for many visitors.
In popular use, the term safari refers to land journeys where you can see stunning African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to slowly approach cars, so standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "nature walk," "walking safari," or "walking tour") consists of hiking, which lasts a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, as it was the host of the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
The expected price of most event tickets will range from 2,500 to 130,000 Japanese yen, with the price of typical tickets being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps wet clothes dry. Numerous hotels provide the option to rent an iron and ironing board, even if they are not available in your room.
If an iron is not available to you, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if it is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric become too warm (which can lead to shrinking or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are several ways to purify water, with some yielding better results against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, then you should consider purchasing water from reputable companies in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or in worse cases trigger allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person are usually not classified as pests by force.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempted from taxes and excises at certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and subsequent sections — usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and strictly adhering to them is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, the mobile network is much stronger here than along many other parts of the road, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds reserve.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rather rich and diverse, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is common, with apples baked year-round, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the regions of interior northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Considering it encompasses 17,000 islands from which to choose, Indonesian food is a general term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
But, if used without additional specifications, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a range of simply seasoned dishes, among which the predominant flavors preferred by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can pose a safety issue due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, several preventive measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if pulled by the rider at the moment of falling.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks, breathtaking views unfold. Hikers from all corners of the world constantly establish new routes among the endless potentials of the mountain slopes.
Snow mountain sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending down snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," plan entire vacations spent skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed at least since the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Hiking with skiing: This activity is often referred to as rural skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to, but usually does not include ski touring or alpine style mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover a slightly longer distance than by walking – but you will very rarely reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean you have to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
In that regard, the Schengen Area, however, functions similarly to a single state.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for visas for each of the Schengen member states, which saves time, money, and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define products over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be shorter in places such as North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is important for the life of the Lapps, and the culture within trade is also important for many who are engaged in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami were heavily dedicated to reindeer herding; they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mostly for pulling and carrying loads.
Today, many Laplanders engage in modern crafts. Tourism is a significant source of income in Lapland, a region located in the Lapland area.
Although common, especially outside the Roma community, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive as it evokes negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to travel advisories, it may affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also wish to hear the advice of the governments of other countries in addition to your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios than Europeans or Arabs.
Reports are just brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or lead to loss of human lives.
Bad weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are different types that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of severe weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, flooding, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks posed by bad weather in the area they are in, as it can affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wishes to travel to a country that could be called a war zone would first need to undergo professional training.
If you type "hostile environment course" into an internet search, you will likely find the address of a local company.
The course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, mainly with practical experience.
The course will typically last from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines that deal with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications that focus on war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return.
The readiness of the government to issue passports that do not specify the person's gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies equally.
Checks at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backward flow of waves separating from the beach, often present at a reef or similar places.
Due to the underwater topology, the rip current is concentrated in a few deeper sections and can create a fast flow to deep water there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion when attempting to swim upstream, which can be unfeasible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is not harder than it usually is.
Try to aim somewhere you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you may want to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock occurs sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your habits from your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding towards you, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that those returning home also require patience and understanding.
The sound and light show in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things here for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
On the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, many nations lay claims and have the most bases there, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains chain, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Vinson reaching 4,892 m.
In remote places, without mobile phone signal coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone because to make a call, you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used when traveling by ship, including yachts, as well as for expeditions that need remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among those who are finishing school, as it allows them to take a gap year before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, attending a course abroad during a gap year can enhance prospects for advancing towards obtaining higher education in the home country.
There is generally a tuition fee for enrolling in one of these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in its lakes and along coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, you do not need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This corresponds to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise very unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, that number is from one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of whole days and return to sleep on the ship during the night.
If you go ashore only as part of ship excursions, you do not need a special visa (as of 2009).
In some cruise brochures, Berlin in Germany is highlighted. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes regarding other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help them overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on the inability to have control over events.
Courier companies are well paid for the quick delivery of items. Often, time is crucial when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for some other routes or for smaller firms, it was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it is possible that it took days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send the luggage as checked. Airline regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to set aside a thick wad of cash for that privilege (or, even better, persuade the company you work for to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than a regular economy ticket for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in even asking for discounts on business class and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered due to ethnic conflict.
This conflict in 1994 resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, it is the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as a very well-connected transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass walls, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvik offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some tombs.
It is worth setting aside half an hour for a walk through the intriguing village.
To the north and in the immediate vicinity lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron recorded a brilliant story about its wonders.
The bus line 403 regularly travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.

Please keep in mind that you are visiting a site of mass graves, as well as a place of almost incalculable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived staying here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or exploited to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
We ask you to treat this place with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or carving graffiti into objects.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and in fact, everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signage is only in Catalan, considering it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used a lot in public transportation and in other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are automatically announced in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, unfriendly, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave nicely - like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make your navigating much easier.
The rudeness of Parisians quickly vanishes if you show a bit of basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and contains a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptionally wide range of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, varying soils, and diverse altitudes.
This area is also home to an exceptionally large number of diverse species of animals and birds.
Rare animal species can be found here, including the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcats, and the capercaillie, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide skirts for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own skirt, especially one with bright colors, you will bring a smile to the face of the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same rule, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
And you can borrow this from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each wearing, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, it's a universal size!
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and overall uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially during summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie", which means "You", are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between some verbs and the object.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to determine whether a verb or adverb is used in the form of a pronoun.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced the way they are written.
The key letters to pay attention to are c and g, given that their pronunciation varies depending on the accompanying consonant.
Also, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means carriage.
Persian language has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that if you speak a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and exist as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution during their heyday was not the problem it is today, they can usually be found in cities or on campuses, where they were more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first celebrations on the occasion of cherry blossom were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove "at least one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "samples" will also get you kicked out, and without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit, and it is very easy to get around; you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But considering that it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rare).
A couple of buses also go north to Hebron, where the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives is located.
Make sure that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron itself, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
River routes inland can be a good basis for planning a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to interesting places on the Danube or boating along the Iria Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night without sleeping, in an open location to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this ritual of spring and fertility originated before the advent of Christians.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, while communities often start celebrating as soon as midnight strikes to commemorate the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to travel, which makes the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, considering the sky will be dark more or less throughout the entire day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchically structured and formal compared to what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are worn in business attire, and colleagues refer to each other by surname or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to seek approval from their superiors for every decision made, and they are also expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
