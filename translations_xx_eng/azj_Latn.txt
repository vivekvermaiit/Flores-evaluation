As an already widely accepted theory, this not only proves that feathers existed in some dinosaurs, but also provides details that fossils cannot provide, such as information on color and three-dimensional graphics.
Scientists said that the underside of this animal's fur is pale or cream-colored, while the upper side appears chestnut-brown.
This finding also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Due to the absence of a well-developed central shaft in the dinosaur's feathers, but the presence of other characteristics such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the central shaft is a result of later evolutionary development of such other characteristics.
From the shape of the feathers, it could be inferred that they were intended not for flying, but more for regulating body temperature or appearance. During the research, it was assumed that although the feathers belonged to the tail of a young dinosaur, they resembled an adult feather rather than a juvenile one.
Despite it being the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers reported that the feathers were like those of an adult creature.

They discovered that the same basic principles that apply to other stars also exist in the Sun, and thus it was determined that the movement of all stars is related to their brightness and rotation and does not originate from anything else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number related to the plasma flow of the star.
The activity in terms of the inversion of the star's magnetic field depends on the Rossby number. The smaller the Rossby number, the less the activity will be.

A type of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) extremely resistant to drugs was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new form of the disease was "extremely concerning and dangerous due to its very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital and at least two of them are medical staff in the hospital.
An infected person can infect 10-15 people they are in close contact with within a year.
However, the percentage of people who contract the drug-resistant type of tuberculosis among the group of people infected with tuberculosis remains low, meaning that out of a total of 330,000 infected individuals in South Africa at any given time, 6,000 have this type.

All entrances to the caves known as "Seven Sisters" have a diameter of at least 100-250 meters (between 328-820 feet).
Infrared imagery suggests that they resemble caves due to the temperature change between day and night.
During the day, they are colder than the surrounding surface, and at night, they are warmer.
According to Glen Cushing from the Astrology Staff of the U.S. Geological Services Bureau and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona, "their thermal activities are not as stable as those in large caves that often support fairly consistent temperatures on the planet Earth, but this is related to those deep holes being in the ground."
The voting process in France was typically a low-tech experience; people participating in the election would enter a booth, mark the candidate they voted for on a ballot paper with the candidates' names pre-printed, and then place the ballot in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope containing the ballot paper into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
In France, the election process is fully regulated by election laws.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that both voters and observers can see that the box is empty at the start of voting, and that no envelopes other than the legally counted ballots have been added.
Candidates may appoint their representatives to observe each stage of the procedure. All collected votes are counted in the evening by volunteers in compliance with certain procedures and under observation.

After eating contaminated feed, both cyanuric acid and melamine were detected in urine samples taken from domestic animals that had died.
According to what the university researchers have said, both components react with each other to form crystals that can cause the kidneys to lose their function.
According to researchers' observations, crystals have also formed in cat urine with added melamine and cyanuric acid.
Observations using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that the composite components of these crystals matched those found in the urine of injured animals.
I'm not sure if you understand this, but many goods imported from Central America are brought into this country without paying customs duties.
Nevertheless, eighty percent of our products are taxed based on the tariffs in Central American countries.
This did not make sense to me, it is absolutely not correct.
The only thing I said to them was: "treat us the way we treat you".

Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
The hospital he was later transferred to, Addenbrooke's, was in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused of murdering his son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Until charges are filed and the trial begins, he will remain in custody. However, any witness testimony may not hold legal force because his pictures have been widely published in the media.
Although this is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, Scottish courts tend to view the publication of images as a potentially harmful step due to the distinct nature of Scottish justice.
"Journalists are treading dangerous waters when they release photos of the suspects and other information about them," said Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee.
The Royal District responsible for all court investigations stated to journalists that they would not provide any comments until the verdict is known at least.
According to the circulated news, that document will refer to the border dispute. In this dispute, Palestine wants the borders to be based specifically on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Among the other issues covered, there was also the future status of Jerusalem, considered sacred by both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands that its military forces remain in the valley continuously for ten years from the moment the agreement is signed. The Palestinian National Authority, however, agrees to allow these forces to be stationed there for only five years.
Due to the trial being tested and its impact being evaluated, shooters participating in the additional inspection test for pest control will be closely monitored by foresters.
Volunteers with adequate proficiency were recruited under the shooting program of the Sports Shooters Association in partnership with NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service) and the Australian Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.

Yesterday, the swearing-in ceremony of Martelli took place before the new nine-member Temporary Election Council (TEC).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in the last four years.
Last month, the commission of the presidential administration recommended the resignation of the previous Central Election Commission (Interim Election Commission) as part of a set of measures to prepare the country for the upcoming elections.
The anti-regime protesters, who started and spread widely in October, were met with a response from the Martelli commission.
Violent protests sometimes flared up because the organization of some elections, which were supposed to be held after 2011, was refused.

Later, the place of the elderly woman who needed the toilet was taken by photographers. Mendoza was neutralized by being shot with a weapon.
Liqqins, who continued his father's path, started working in the field of healthcare.
After completing her midwifery education, she worked at the Auckland State Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the Liquins hospital, he began to learn about premature births in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone is applied, the process of fetal lung development would accelerate.
Xinhua reported that state investigators were able to recover two "black boxes" that record the flight data on Wednesday.
Other wrestler colleagues also commemorated Luna.
"Luna was the first Queen of Ekstrim. She was my first manager. She died on the night when there were two moons. Her death was as unique as she was. She was a strong woman," added Tommi Drimer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was unusual like me... almost more than me... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
In the 2010 federal elections, among 1400 participants in the pre-election survey, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Minister Julia Gillard, who was acting as Prime Minister, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia will become a republic during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
According to the poll, the number of people who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen constituted 34 percent.
Based on the final results of the survey, 29% of participants believe that Australia will become a republic, while 31% believe that it will never achieve this.

The largest known number to date was discovered on January 25 by Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at Central Missouri University.
This discovery, confirmed by several people using different devices and software until the beginning of February, was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are likely sources of water and organic matter that can support life and create proteins on Earth.
Scientists are trying to understand how the Earth was formed because planets, especially comets, collided with the Earth a long time ago.
At the beginning of this year, 53-year-old Cuomo, who started performing the duties of governorship, passed a bill last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He called all these rumors "political blabbering and stupidity."
There are rumors that he will run as a candidate in the 2016 presidential elections.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system will allow planes to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions.
For this purpose, instead of the old, ground-based radar technology, satellite-based technology is used, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of the aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional vehicles are allowed to be parked, overground trains will continue on their way without stopping at Wembley, there are no car stops, parks, or transit facilities along the way.
The fear of lack of transportation increased the likelihood of the match being played in a closed area without team fans.
The journal "Science" published a new study on Thursday about the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at the United States' Princeton University reported that new species can become established in just two generations, but it is thought that this process would take longer than the formation of a selectively bred endemic "Darwin's ground finch," from "Geospiza" to migratory cactus finches and the "Geospiza sparrows."
Gold can be molded into any shape. It can be rolled into a small form.
It can be bent and twisted into a thin wire. It can be hammered and folded into sheets.
It can be delicately crafted and applied onto other metals, and it can even be made so fine that it can be used to decorate the hand-drawn illustrations of books sometimes referred to as "illuminated manuscripts."
These chemical substances are called pH. It is possible to make an indicator using black cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidic or alkaline content of the chemical substance.
The pH level in the composition of the analyzed chemicals is determined by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) they contain.
Protons that have been separated from their electrons are considered hydrogen ions, because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron.
After mixing the two dry powders together, slightly wet your hands and form a ball from this mixture.
The moisture on your hands will affect the outer layers, which can create a tickling sensation on your hand and can form a type of crust.
Siphon toilets connected to a complex sewerage system are characteristic of almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.
In Greece, remnants of the sewage system were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Iran, and China had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes a part of public baths where men and women went together, in a mixed manner.
You can call someone thousands of miles away through a satellite.
The satellite sent into space reflects it back immediately after receiving the signal.
The satellite was launched into space with a rocket. Because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and images, scientists use a telescope in space.
A satellite or telescope can only be placed in space with a large rocket that is 100 feet long.
The greatest achievement gifted to us by the wheel, which significantly changed the world, is easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to this invention, we gained the train, the automobile, and also many other types of transportation.
Beneath them are larger-sized cats that feed on medium-sized animals like rabbits, antelopes, and gazelles.
Lastly, small cats (including cozy house cats) have many prey such as bugs, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their achievements is based on the niche concept of phrases like "Every cat with a special job is unrivaled."
Lions are the most social felines, living in groups called prides.
Prides consist of up to thirty female lions and cubs, as well as 1-3 adult male lions.
Female lions are usually very close to each other as a large family consisting of daughters and sisters.
Lion prides act in a manner surprisingly similar to wolf or dog packs, which are deadly hunters for their prey, rather than resembling other big cats in their behavior.
The tiger has the abilities to climb (at a moderate level), swim, jump long distances, and carry loads 5 times more than a strong person, like an athlete with good flexibility.
Tigers (from the genus Panthera) are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars. The only cats that can roar are these four creatures.
The tiger's roar does not resemble the loud roar made by a sweet voice; it is more heard as words that sound hoarse and tinkling.
Ocelots feed on small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals hunted by ocelots are smaller than it is.
According to scientists, ocelots find and track their prey (animals) by smelling the location they are in.
Ocelots can see very well in the dark due to their night vision and also blend into their surroundings to hunt their prey at the first opportunity by moving stealthily.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the population to which they belong, they find themselves in a different environment from that in which they previously lived (for example, if they are taken to the other side of a mountain or river, or to a new island, they cannot easily return).
This new environment has various resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will require various traits and adaptations to become a stronger competitor compared to its previous form.
The initial form of the population has actually not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
As the newly settled population gradually begins to adapt to the environment, they resemble others less.
As a result, after thousands and even millions of years, the two species may not be able to be classified as the same genus because they will appear more different than today.
We call this process the speciation process, meaning that it involves the formation of new species. This process is an inevitable result of the evolutionary process and a very important component.
Plants produce the oxygen necessary for humans to breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that is exhaled.
Plants grow by undergoing photosynthesis through sunlight. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our house and make our clothes, and most of the food we eat consists of plants. Animals could not live without plants.
Because the Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, it was not afraid of other creatures except for its relatives, the mosasaurs.
In its long jaws, there were more than 70 sharp teeth and an additional set on the upper palate, which meant that nothing could escape alive from its grip.
Undoubtedly, although we do not have precise information, we think it has a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it can even be assumed to be a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that got into the water, even a giant dinosaur like Trex couldn't match it.
Even though we recognize most of their ingredients, the Romans have different feast foods such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of dormouse called "sÃ¼leysin."
Another difference was that while the poor and a woman sat on chairs to eat, wealthy people organized feasts together and ate their meals while resting, lying on their sides.
In the following centuries, dishes coming from America or Asia to Europe were not included in ancient Roman cuisine.
This meant that they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey meat.
The people of Babylon used to build a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of that god.
While the priests tried to meet the demands of the gods with ceremonies and festivals, people would also bring sacrifices to their gods.
Each temple features a cloister and a sanctuary that only monks can enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-like towers, called ziggurats, were constructed as part of temples.
The topmost part of the tower was intended only for worshiping God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house did not hold much importance.
Living in the open air was often a way of life for Hebrew families.
The women were preparing the food in their yards, and the shops consisted only of open stalls facing the street. Stones were used to construct houses.
There were no vast forest areas in Kenan's land, so wood products were extremely expensive.
In Greenland, the population is sparsely distributed. It is stated in Norse sagas that Erik the Red, having killed a man, is exiled from Iceland, heads west, discovers Greenland, and names it as such.
But the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time, regardless of its discovery.
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are "Scandinavian" countries, but there are many differences among their peoples, monarchs, customs, and history.
If you think there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, you have watched the movie "National Treasure."
However, this is not true. What is written on the back of the document is not a map leading to treasure.
The words "The original of the Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" are written upside down at the bottom on the back of the Declaration of Independence document.
Although it is not known who wrote this document, consisting of a large sheet of parchment folded for safekeeping (measuring 24Â½ inches long and 29Â¾ inches wide), it is known that it was written early in his life.
So, the notation is likely just added as a label.
Although the northern part of France was freed from enemy occupation thanks to the Normandy landings and ongoing battles, the southern part was still deprived of freedom.
The French, who were called "Vichy," were governed by them. In 1940, this French people who signed a peace treaty with the Germans cooperated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the name of the invasion plan was "Operation Dragoon."
The Americans and Free French forces liberated the south of France in just two weeks and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a unified culture in which a large group of people living and working together shares a society.
The word "Civilization" in Latin is derived from the word "civilis," which means "civil," and also from the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen," and from the word "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and additionally it defines the scale of society in a certain form.
The predecessors of nations were city-states. Civilization accepts cultural transmission, the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation, the preservation of cultural traces, and their fair distribution.
Smaller cultures typically cannot be recognized as civilizations because they disappear without leaving behind historical evidence unique to them.
In accordance with the Articles of Confederation, the thirteen states united and established a weak central government, of which the only component was the Congress, while the Revolutionary War was still ongoing.
The congress, which did not have the authority to impose taxes, relied on state agencies that were not very useful in the implementation of all laws because there was no national executive or judiciary.
Moreover, he does not have the authority to invalidate international tax legislation and tariffs.
Anonymous consent must be obtained from all states before changes to the articles are applied, but the states were so indifferent to the central government that the representatives representing them often skipped meetings.
The Italy national football team, together with the Germany national team, is the second most successful team in the world and became the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing are among the popular sports.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions of the country. The Italians also participate in international competitions and the Olympic games.
The Japanese have approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) and this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan, due to its cluster and group of islands and geographical location, is also called an "archipelago."
In the 15th century, after European sailors recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island," Taiwan entered the period when it was known by those names.
In 1624, the Dutch "East India" Company, by revolutionizing local grain production practices, as well as hiring Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar cane plantations, established a base in southwestern Taiwan.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), which had seized the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat it experienced in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which confirmed that it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which retained it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consisted of three main monuments called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Restoration work was applied to many of the buildings around the complex with the aim of giving tourists an impression of how their originals actually looked.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored and reconstruction work is still ongoing.
For example, we can say that the most common photography format in the world is still the one on 35 mm film, which was considered the most used film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced currently, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is applied in digital camera image sensor formats.
Although the 35 mm format might sound a bit confusing, it actually means 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
For this reason, it is reported that the ratio between the parties in that format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest form) is 3:2.
Many widespread formats (formats belonging to the APS family can be cited as examples) equal this width-to-height ratio or are approximately close to it.
The rule of thirds, which is most exploited and often mocked, is a simple rule that creates dynamism by maintaining a certain sequential stage of a picture.
It is noted there that the most effective place for the main object is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
The strengthening and enrichment of the Catholic Church coming under the control of the state occurs in this period of European history.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European countries despite the differences in religion, language, and traditions.
His all-encompassing power influenced everyone, from the king to his people.
One of the fundamental principles of Christianity was that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial funds contributed to the church were to be used solely for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for millennia, and the concentration of power and financial resources in such a place raised questions among people about the implementation of this principle.
Shortly after England commenced military operations, it blockaded Germany by sea.
Although this blockade violated the generally accepted norms of international law governed by several international agreements of the past two centuries, the strategy demonstrated its impact by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.
To prevent any ship from entering all parts of the ocean, Britain did not hesitate to even endanger ordinary ships and mined international waters.
Because the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany was expecting an analog reaction to its own unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the main attitude of many citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities experienced during the First World War, nations never wish to face such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offered to him at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States of America, he had only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China represented different time zones in its own unique form. Each phase of China, or each family in power, was a unique dynasty.
Additionally, among the principalities, the fragmented provinces had different periods. The most well-known of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years with conflicts between the Han and Jin principalities.
During these times, ruthless battles occurred among the nobles who fought for the throne.
This was the Three Kingdoms period, one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people perished fighting for the highest throne situated in the magnificent palace in Xi'an.
The use of the metric system among many existing social and political influences includes the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the beliefs that the country belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, professions were open to all male candidates who were most ambitious and ready to succeed.
The same can be said for the army, because the army ranking was determined by caliber, not by class.
The French Revolution had also inspired the working class subjected to repression in other countries to start a revolution.
Muhammad also showed deep interest in non-worldly matters. He would frequently visit the cave called "Hira" on the mountain of Nur to think.
A remarkably clear impression related to the spiritual allure of the Prophet Muhammad is formed in the cave itself, which has withstood the test of time.
This cave, completely isolated from the rest of the world, is located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, although its existence is known, it is difficult to find. Entering the cave means being completely isolated.
When looking up, nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky and the mountains surrounding it. It is very difficult to feel the world from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is just one of the seven wonders that have survived to the present day.
The Great Pyramid, constructed in the 3rd century BC by the Egyptians, is one of the many large pyramids built to immortalize the memory of the deceased Pharaoh.
As Europe emerged from the Middle Ages, the combination of Chants of the Roman Catholic community (later called Gregorian chants) and Liturgy rites resulted in the development of a type of music that was later spread across all of Europe through the papacy and monasteries for both men and women to sing.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while the smaller pyramids around it and most of the tombs and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper curve" symbol resembles the letter V, while the "lower curve" symbol resembles a clamp or an incomplete square.
When you say "upper," you should draw the bow from top to bottom, and when you say "lower," you should draw the bow towards you starting from the side (where you hold the bow) of the violin.
The upper string usually produces softer sounds, while the lower string produces stronger and more decisive sounds.
Do not hesitate to mark your own signs with a pen, but the printed bow signs imply any detail in the music, so they should be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Lady Elizabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by the crowd created by market women on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage among a group of people who looked at the king and queen, shouting their hatred and threatening them.
Due to the large crowd of people, the King and Queen had to fully open the car windows.
At this moment, a person from the crowd waved the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of the battles incurred during the occupation of the Philippines by American imperialism were extracted from the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large portion of costs and fluctuating bond interests through branches of a Wall Street bank on behalf of the Philippine government.
Undoubtedly, a significant profit that constituted the main gain of American imperialism was derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people.
Understanding the context that motivates the order of creation is required to comprehend the Templars.
The 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, during which the events took place, are known as the Early Middle Ages in European history (AD 1000-1300).
After the early Middle Ages, the later Middle Ages come, which last for 1500 years.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice various ideas, from the attempt, or necessity, of technological development, to the definite mindset that human destiny is directed by the fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations related to technological determinism are based on two general ideas: the notion that technological development advances on a path larger than cultural or political influence on its own, and the idea that technology exhibits a unique "influence" on society, not conditioned by social contexts.
For example, we can say that motor vehicles play a leading role in the development of roads.
Despite all this, a nationwide transport network is not economically viable for only a small number of vehicles, therefore new production methods are being developed that can reduce the costs of car ownership.
The majority of the population owning cars, along with the increase in road accidents, also leads to the invention of new technologies in the healthcare sector to treat those physically injured in accidents.
Romanticism, taken from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, possesses a great element of cultural determinism.
Associated with romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and as time progressed, customs and cultures emerged according to that geography, which, in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily determined laws.
Considering that Paris is the fashion center of the modern world, Constantinople was also regarded as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
It began to be recognized as the center of luxury around the 400th year of our era and maintained this status until the 1100th year of our era.
Among the factors, such as the Crusaders returning with items more valuable than the goods in the Byzantine markets, like silk and spices, it began to gradually lose its status in the twelfth century.
It was precisely at this time that the title of "Fashion Capital" of Constantinople was transferred to Paris.
During the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century, the Gothic style reached its peak.
Initially, Eastern Byzantine culture influenced the clothing.
However, due to weak communication channels, Western styles were 25-30 years behind.
Western Europe began to improve its lifestyle towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest innovations of the era was the beginning of the use of buttons to fasten people's clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Family farming is a type of farming related to the production of enough products to meet the food needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Family farming involves a system where agriculture is made easier and more organic through rotational cropping, using seed products adapted to the eco-region or relatively simpler techniques to increase yield.
Historically, many farming families were engaged in peasant farming and this is still the case in most developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel overlooked according to societal standards and lead them to create a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, place, and/or the sex of the members are factors that differentiate subcultures.
The aspects that separately classify a subculture can be evaluated as language, aesthetics, religious, political, gender, geographical factors, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture typically demonstrate their membership through the characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, actions, and argot.
Referring to a few tragic life stories of children who have grown up neglected, unhappy, or exploited and have not been introduced to social life by adults during their upbringing is one of the most common methods used to express the importance of socialization.
Such children are called "wild" or feral. Some of those wild children are imprisoned at home by people (usually their parents), and in some cases, their parents abandon them because they reject the child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
Before runaway children are abandoned or flee from someone, they may have been subjected to child abuse or trauma.
It is claimed that other children are raised by animals, and some live spontaneously in the wild.
A completely feral child raised by animals will display fear or indifference towards humans, almost imitating the behavior of the animal that raised them (within physical limitations).
Although the learning process is aimed at making project-based teaching easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method takes it to completely new levels.
A temporary device is more a tool for students using new learning methods, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project, rather than a teaching method.
Temporary constructs are both virtual and real, meaning a teacher is a temporary construct, but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual temporary modules are integrated into the software and are designed to ask questions related to procedures that a student may find challenging, receive quick responses, and explain the procedures.
Due to various reasons such as neglect, ruthless treatment, and even violence, children are placed with guardian families.
No child should grow up in an environment where there is no one to feed, care for, and provide training and education, yet they do.
We consider the Guardianship Care System as a safety zone for those children.
Providing a safe home, caring guardian, stable education, and reliable healthcare is essential in the foster family system.
All the needs that are lacking in the house from which the children have come out must be met by the guardian family.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The various features of the internet lead to additional values in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are offered as significant types of motivation for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eymi and MakKord, who investigated the public's attitude towards websites, identified "individual participation" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational factors in 1998.
The use of video recordings led to significant findings in the revelation of facial movements that last for a few milliseconds, called micro-expressions.
It was claimed that whether someone was lying or not could be understood, especially by interpreting micro-expressions appropriately.
In the article titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks discusses how, despite not understanding the speech due to brain injury, people can still correctly assess the speaker's sincerity.
He claimed that even some animals, such as domestic dogs, possess this ability to interpret human behavior.
Twentieth-century research showed that genetic diversity has two bases: latent and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic diversity, while selection picks it out from among the expressed variants.
Separation and recombination mix variations back and forth between two groups from each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a system similar to a human digestive system in the savanna to meet its amino acid needs from the plants there.
Even the inability to do this can lead to serious consequences such as growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily obtainable plant resources may be proteins derived from leaves and legumes, but they are foods that can be difficult to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, animal feeds (ants, termites, eggs) not only are easily digestible, but they also provide the body with a high amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids it needs.
Considering everything, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" like the chimpanzees on the savanna today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of waking up suddenly while asleep and falling back asleep again within a short period of time (10-60 min.).
This can be easily implemented by using an alarm clock with a relatively weaker sound, just to bring back your consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you turn off the alarm clock and fall back asleep when it rings, placing it somewhere away from your bed would force you to get up from your bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices involve consuming excessive amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, or a known diuretic) before bed and include the method of frequent urination.
The level of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the level of tension in that person's body and soul.
In a place where there is little tension, the zest for life is much greater. The desire to attain complete comfort and satisfaction is inherent in every person.
Everyone can be enlightened. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and pessimism.
The Buddhist belief of the Tibetans is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has become more comprehensive with the path of love in Mahayana and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love, which make up Tibetan Buddhism, are in principle very simple.
Kundalini energy (thought clarification) is awakened through Kundalini Yoga, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization as yoga movements.
Divine Yoga stands at the center of Tibetan meditation. Various celestial beings are depicted for the purification of energy channels and activation of chakras, awakening the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany, which caused the USSR and the USA to act together in the Second World War, was a common enemy. With the end of the war, system, process, and cultural clashes led to the separation of countries from one another.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
The Cold War continued for the next 40 years, with actual power "armies" in all battle zones from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
After the defense of Poland was breached on September 17, 1939, retreating and reorganizing under the shadow of Romania was the only hope remaining.
However, these plans became invalid overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union, by invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, namely the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, entered Belarus and Ukraine and established fronts there.
The most efficient way to transport a large number of people and goods across the oceans was to use cargo ships.
Traditionally, the task of navies has been not only to protect your country's ability to transport its own people and goods but also to interfere with the enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
The North Atlantic operation of World War II is one of the most notable examples of this in recent times. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy primarily used U-boats to try to prevent this action.
Germany could only conquer England like the rest of Europe if the allies were defeated in this struggle.
It appears that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
In ancient cultures, tribes began to keep them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats that join herds usually roaming in hills or other grazing areas are tended by goatherds who resemble shepherds more closely, but are usually children and adolescents. Such herding methods are still used today.
Carriageways were constructed in England in the early 16th century.
Although railway tracks consisted only of parallel wooden sleepers, horses were allowed to pull them along with their heavy loads to increase speed on the more difficult paths.
Sleepers were provided quickly enough to hold the sections of the railway track in place. Still, over time, it was thought that these tracks would be more favorable if there was iron on top of those rails.
It started being used as a widely spread application, but wagon wheels with iron undercarriages wore out wooden wheels more quickly.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by steel wheels, and for the first time, in 1767, fully steel rails were introduced to the market.
Humans began to walk two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man), and thus the first means of transportation as we know it became walking on foot.
The habit of walking upright did not exist in Australopithecus ancestors.
Signs of bipedalism were discovered in Australopithecus remains from 4.2-3.9 million years ago; however, it should be considered that Sahelanthropus could also walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can take the first step by showing a more friendly attitude towards nature, join movements related to environmental protection, and even become activists to prevent potential damage to nature to some extent in the future.
In most cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. But if we do not want to solve the problems just temporarily, we must identify their root and neutralize them.
It is clear that the achievements in the field of science and technology in humanity have turned the world into a different place, and the large number of people and their interest in extravagant lifestyles have caused problems to increase further.
After being adopted by the Congress on July 4, the manuscript of the law signed by the Speaker of the Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap located several buildings away.
In one night, 150-200 copies of the document known as the "Dunlap broadsides" were produced.
The document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
George Washington read the copy sent to him on July 6 to his troops in New York City on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
As we know, the 25 posters preserved by Dunlap to this day are the oldest copies of the document that have reached us. There is no existing copy with the original handwriting.
In the modern world, most paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
The reason many people do not consider them as dinosaurs is because they have feathers and cannot fly.
However, birds still have many aspects that resemble dinosaurs.
These birds, which have scaly skin and clawed feet, can lay eggs and are able to walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurus rexes.
The manipulation of data encoded with binary numbers constitutes the operating principle of almost all computers used today.
A binary number has only one of two values, namely either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not manifest itself quickly. Since symptoms such as vomiting are very common, it is not always possible to make an accurate diagnosis.
The fact of the medicine container being left open or the presence of chemically toxic household substances is the best indicator of internal poisoning.
Read the brochure that contains emergency medical instructions against this specific poison.
Entomologists use the term insect in a general sense for insects belonging to this group.
This term has arisen because we have known bedbugs, which have the ability to live as parasites in the human organism, since ancient times.
Both blood-sucking insects and bedbugs are dangerous; they are capable of living in the nest or in the host organism's home.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States, indicating that it is observed as a major neurological disease primarily among young and middle-aged patients.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have determined that the likelihood of the spread of multiple sclerosis among women is twice as high compared to men.
A couple may think that raising a child is contrary to their own interests or the interests of their children.
These couples can make a plan to adopt a child.
In the adoption process, the biological parents of the child relinquish their parental rights so that another family can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to investigate the way the world works using scientific methods. In fact, this method leads to many scientific studies.
However, in fact, this is not just an experiment, an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more probable hypotheses, asking questions and making observations are also part of scientific research.
Scientists of nature and philosophy were studying classical texts, especially the Holy Book written in Latin.
Including psychology, Aristotle's ideas were used in all scientific matters.
As the mastery of the Greek language declined, the West gradually began to sever from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Mainly, rhythms that depend on the presence of endogenous periods and their emergence through biological clocks are more commonly encountered in physiology and behavior.
Regular rhythms that are not formed solely by reaction to external periodic signals are developed for most living concepts such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and also animals.
Oscillators that can maintain their free-running period and self-regulate without external influence are called biological clocks.
DNA being a genetic material was one of the main ideas put forward based on the Hersey and Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They labeled the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus and the proteins of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur to conduct two experiments.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the infected piece of genetic material, and whether or not the infected cell is a germ cell, mutations can have effects in different forms.
Mutations that can be passed on to children only when in the germ cell can cause cell death or cancer when elsewhere.
Tourism trips organized in the lap of nature attract more attention from people who are interested in exploring natural sites to enjoy the scenery, including plants, animals, and wildlife.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and walking in parks, as well as learning about ecosystems, can be examples of activities on site.

Every morning, people get into cars and leave their small towns to go to work, while those with jobs along the way in the places these people came from pass them by heading in the opposite direction.
In this dynamic route scheme, everyone is linked to and supports a system based on individual vehicles in some form.
Science shows that the mass carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state that supported human evolution in the last two years.
Almost everyone who is a member of society complains about public transportation even though they use it.
In developed countries, you can rarely hear complaints of a similar nature, such as the quality of water or the collapse of a bridge.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they experience problems every day? Are the engineers of the vehicles incompetent? Or are more fundamental things happening?
Traffic is an analysis of the individual movements of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactive connections they create with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers generally demonstrate reasonably sensible behavior, therefore, traffic flows usually fit within a certain logical framework and can even be approximately represented mathematically.
To better describe traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This collaboration helps in the planning, design, and implementation of highways.
The ability to fly of the insects, considered the first animals to take to the air, enabled them to easily escape from predators, find food, and mate more efficiently.
Many insects have the ability to fold their wings over themselves.
These features provide them with a wide variety of small places where they can protect themselves from predators.
Currently, there are only two insects that cannot fold their wings over their backs, one of them is the dragonfly, and the other is the mayfly.
It was said by a man named Aristarchus thousands of years ago that the solar system moves around the Sun.
Although some thought he was right, the majority of people believed the opposite, i.e., including the Sun itself (and even other stars), that the Solar System revolved around the Earth.
Since the movement of the Earth planet is not felt, this idea seems logical, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the largest river on the planet Earth and the second longest river. Its volume of water is 8 times more than that of the second largest river by size.
The largest river in the world, the Amazon, is up to 6 miles wide in some places.
20 percent of the water flowing from the rivers of our planet into the oceans belongs to the Amazon.
The main Amazon River, which collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long.
Although the construction of the stone pyramid continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were unbeatable in terms of their size and technical perfection of their constructions.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were astonished by the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The Vatican has approximately 800 residents. It is considered the smallest, independent country in the world with the least number of inhabitants.
Italian is the legal and official language of communication in the Vatican.
Italian is the language used daily by most of the people working in the province, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
Roman Catholics are citizens of the Vatican.
In nature, people have had knowledge about the main chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, which were discovered in natural form and could be extracted relatively more easily with primitive tools, since ancient times.
According to Aristotle's theory, everything is composed of one or several of the four elements. These elements were air, water, fire, and earth.
It more closely resembles the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he assumed that those substances transformed into new substances to form what we want to see.
Alloys are mainly formed from the mixture of two or more metals. Let's not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table of chemical elements.
Chemical elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, metals like silver and gold also exist.
It is also possible to obtain alloys containing small amounts of non-metal elements such as carbon.
Matter, which consists of small particles called atoms, makes up everything in the universe.
The volume of atoms is so small that if trillions of them are combined, they would be as large as a single period at the end of this sentence.
Since the day it was invented, the pencil has become a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods were discovered, the use of the pen declined further.
People now write their messages on a computer screen, while pencil sharpeners are increasingly becoming a thing of the past.
In this case, it only remains for us to guess what the keyboard will be used for after a new invention.
The operating principle of a nuclear bomb is based on the energy required to fuse a nucleus with multiple protons and neutrons.
This is like driving a heavy-loaded cart uphill. With the splitting of the nucleus, some of the energy is released.
In some atoms, the tendency to split with very little or no impulse is very strong because they have an unstable nucleus.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side, and 100 km thick on the far side.
"Maria" appears thinner beneath the darker layers and thicker under the mountainous areas.
Because the crust is thinner on the side of the Moon that faces the Earth, there might be more lunar seas there. It was easier for basaltic lava to reach the surface.
The main goal of content theories is to determine what motivates people or what appeals to them.
These theories indicate that people hold certain needs or desires within themselves as they grow up and age.
These theories learn what motivates certain individuals to take action and what in their environment drives them to take or not take certain actions.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two popular theories from the motivation theories group.
In general, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two types of behavior can manifest. One end of this spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
Leaders like this struggle to make unpopular decisions, impose disciplinary penalties, assess work quality, give assignments, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of this spectral line, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who thinks that they should change everything a group has done and redo everything themselves.
Ultimately, the leader bears full responsibility for whether their team succeeds or not.
This style of behavior often leads to a difference of opinion between leaders and other members of the team.
In terms of the same quality standards, virtual teams are considered equal to traditional teams with very subtle differences.
Members of the virtual group are usually used as contact points for physical teams close to them.
The teams have more independence than a traditional team member because they can meet at different time zones that are unclear to the local management system.
One of the irreplaceable parts of a virtual team is the presence of the real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) factor.
"The management group that sets standards for team members in the 'Invisible Team,' where each member reports, is referred to as the 'Invisible Team.'"
Why would a company go to great lengths to earn the name of a learning company? Because the sole purpose of applying internal learning concepts in practice is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and skill can emerge.
Consequently, an organizational process that operates collaboratively to overcome an obstacle may play a leading role in new innovations that will meet customer needs.
To ensure that the enterprise is innovative, the management should establish a culture of innovation along with a knowledge-sharing and intra-organizational learning culture.
Angel (2006) explains that it is used as a method to help companies elevate their work to a higher level from a Holistic Environment approach.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of knowledge. For this reason, it reduces the scope of research and brings it into a more precise form.
The research of scientists confirms the connection between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known to everyone that various brain traumas, injuries, fractures, and tumors affect human movements and cause changes in some mental functions.
With the development of new technologies, it is possible to observe and study forms and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to form imitation templates that facilitate our understanding of the stages in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence carries a strong science-fiction connotation, it reveals a very important branch of computer science related to machine behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence.
The AI research is about the creation of technology for the automatic execution of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Testing, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition are included.
Such topics have brought forth various disciplines that discuss solving problems encountered in real life.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, which are installed in several home computers and software suitable for video games, are frequently used not only in the economy, medicine, engineering, and military fields.
Field trips make up a large part of any educational program. In many cases, teachers love to take their students on trips to places where travel by bus is not possible.
Thanks to the virtual travel solution offered by technology, students will be able to sit in class and look at museum exhibits, view aquariums, or marvel at wonderful art samples.
Sharing any school trip virtually is a great way to reflect on the trip and share our experiences in future lessons.
Since a new model of the website created by students of Bennett School in the state of North Carolina about their trip to the state capital is prepared every year, the old one is preserved and kept as an album.
Blogs are effective for improving students' writing skills. Although students typically start with poor grammatical and spelling knowledge in blog practice, having an audience changes this situation.
Usually, since students constitute the most critical audience, the author of the blog strives to further refine the writing in order to avoid criticism.
Moreover, writing a blog "encourages students to gather more information about the surrounding world." The desire to capture the reader's attention inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging enhances the spirit of collaboration among students and encourages them to expand their knowledge beyond what they learn at school.
Students can reinforce their analytical and critical skills by appropriately using blogs; they can frequently refer to internet materials and develop a position based on others' writings, as well as determine their perspectives on specific topics. (Oravec, 2002).
Many art galleries and museums located in Ottawa, Canada's bilingual and magnificent capital, showcase its past and present.
Ahead to the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north are Muskoka and other unexplored natural beauties.
All this and more allow foreigners to fully regard Ontario as the true Canada.
In the vast areas starting from the north, the population is sparsely settled, and some places have virtually never been touched by human foot.
The comparison of the population surprises many, as there are more African Americans settled in the USA than Canadian citizens.
In the part of the Indian Ocean that falls on the eastern coasts of Africa, there are East African islands.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is undoubtedly like the largest and a continent on its own.
Many of the relatively smaller islands are independent or dependent on France and are famous as luxurious coastal vacation destinations.
The Islamic religion brought by the Arabs to these lands spread as far as the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
With the discovery of the sea route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the expansion of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century.
The region is surrounded by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their actual marital status, all female travelers are advised to indicate that they are married.
Wearing a ring might also work (just make sure itâ€™s not too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural diversities can result in what they call aggression, and that it does not at all resemble actions like mugging, armed pursuit, etc.
Be assertive when rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground firmly (whether or not there are cultural differences, this is unacceptable!).
In the 10th century BC, the modern city of Casablanca, founded by Berber fishermen, was called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, and was used as a strategic port city.
The Portuguese left Casa Branca, which they had destroyed and restored, after the earthquake in 1755.
Spanish traders who established trading markets in the city called it Casablanca, and the Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar el-Beida.
Casablanca is one of the most appealing places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient city of Medina, it is very easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as textiles, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various types of decorative items, but all of these are intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located at the eastern end of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava flowing from the Nyiragongo volcano, affecting many streets of the city, mainly the city center.
Although Goma is extremely reliable, visits to places outside of Goma should be examined to understand the situation of the ongoing war in the North Kivu province.
The city is also considered a key place for climbing the Nyiragongo volcanic mountain, which is one of the cheapest ways to observe the Mountain Gorilla in Africa.
You can use a means of transport called boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around the hut. If you want to go a short distance, the normal (local) price of a taxi is ~500 Congolese Francs.
The word "Timbuktu" had also started to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands due to its relative unassailability.
Although Timbuktu has become a tourist attraction due to its popularity today and even has an airport, it is considered a poor city.
As a result of the desert sands posing a threat, in 1990 it was added to the World Heritage List as an endangered monument.
Henri Louis Gates' exclusive program on the PBS channel, related to the Wonders of the African World, was one of the most significant stops here.
This city, where the Arab spirit is felt more than the African, contrasts completely with the other cities of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-west of South Africa, extending along the eastern border with Mozambique and the northern border with Zimbabwe, and bordered to the south by the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 kmÂ² and it is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each encompassing a distinct wildlife.
In addition to being one of the most notable places in South Africa, this is also considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in South Africa, this park also requires a daily conservation and entrance fee.
In addition, purchasing a Wild Card that provides access to selected parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's National Parks can also be beneficial.
The island of Hong Kong has given its name to the area where it is located, and this area is the main center attracting the attention of tourists.
The arrangement of the buildings that create the silhouette of Hong Kong can be compared to a captivating, shimmering histogram emerging with the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon shore.
Much of the urbanization of Hong Kong Island falls on the densely reclaimed areas along the northern coast.
This is a place occupied by British colonists, so if you are looking for evidence related to the colonial history of the region, you can start here.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove region and extends 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans forest, included in the UNESCO World Heritage List and located in the territory of India, was named Sundarban National Park.
In these forests, which do not only consist of mangrove swamps, some of the last remaining trees of the mighty jungles that once surrounded the Indo-Gangetic plain are present.
The Sundarbans, approximately 1/3 of which consists of water and wetlands, covers an area of 3850 kmÂ².
Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. It is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
From the intercity bus station located by the riverside, buses depart throughout the day, but many of them, especially those heading east and the Chakar/Bumthang bus, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Intercity buses are usually crowded, so it is recommended to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
In most regions, comfortable and reliable small Japanese long-distance buses operate.
Taking a shared taxi to close places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200) is both fast and comfortable.
The bridge over the Oyapok River is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapok River to connect the towns in Brazil's Oyapok region with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The bridge, with a length of 378 meters and two road lanes with a width of 3.50 meters, is located between two towers with a height of 83 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge measures 15 meters. Although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The inauguration of the bridge is planned for September 2017, which is the time when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to complete their work.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group, currently living as semi-nomadic hunter tribes in eastern Paraguay, engaged in family-farming activities.
Other local tribal groups, such as Quaycuru and Payaqua, who settled in the Chaco region, were engaged in hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, once known as the "Great Province of India," emerged in the 16th century as a result of the confrontation between Spanish invaders and representatives of the local people.
The Spanish colonial period lasted for 3 centuries.
Paraguay managed to preserve its national characteristics and identity after the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537.
One of the factors that makes Argentina famous is the world's best polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be encountered here.
If you want to find out where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo games, check AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), and its value is equal to that of the British pound (GBP).
Currency can only be exchanged on the islands at the bank located in front of the "FIC West" store in Stanley.
In general, throughout the islands, along with the British pound sterling, Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
It is likely that credit cards will not be accepted on remote islands, but British and US currencies may be accepted. Confirm with the entrepreneurs in advance which payment systems are used in the country you are going to.
Since it is almost impossible to exchange the currency used in the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, exchange the money before leaving the islands.
When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is spring in Montevideo, located south of the equator, and conversely, when it is spring there, it is winter here.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical climate zone and during the summer months, the air temperature usually exceeds +30Â°C.
Although the temperature drops below the freezing point, if the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows, this or similar situations indicate that the winter cold is deceptive.
Since the amount of rainfall throughout the year remains approximately the same, there are no specific "rainy" and "dry" season concepts here.
The majority of animals in the zoo are accustomed to seeing people, but nature is still wild, so it is not allowed to approach them to feed or disturb them.
According to the park management's warning, you must stand at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
Although bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals may seem very docile, they can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors who do not maintain a certain distance are injured. Considering that these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, it is essential to keep a distance from them.
Furthermore, keep in mind that bears and other wildlife animals have a well-developed sense of smell, so do not carry or cook foods that emit odors, and also keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Founded in the 1850s, Apia has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was a place made famous by its maritime commotion, where in 1889, 7 ships from Germany, the United States of America, and England refused to depart from there.
All ships sank, leaving only one English cruiser remaining. Close to 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence, the peaceful assembly organized in the city by the Mau movement resulted in the killing of high-ranking leader III Tupua Tamasese Lealofi.
Auckland is located between two harbors, so there are many beaches here. The most famous ones are in these three areas.
The beaches of the Pacific Ocean's "North Shore" extend along the coast from Devonport in the south to "Long Bay" in the north, encompassing the "North Harbour" port.
Almost all sandy beaches are considered safe for swimming, and pohutukawa trees provide shaded areas on most beaches.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located near the Waitemata Harbor, in the prestigious coastal suburbs of Mission Bay and the St. Heliers part of Central Auckland.
There are many shops along the shores of these beaches where families also head. It is safe to swim here.
The local beer with a simple composition, pleasant taste, and refreshing quality is called "Number One." The other one is called "Manta."
Although there are many French wines that you may know, here you can find more wines from New Zealand and Australia.
Drinking local tap water is not at all dangerous, but if you are hesitant, it is also easy to obtain bottled water.
The concept of "flat white" is unfamiliar to Australians. An "espresso" is a strong black coffee shot, a cappuccino is a drink with cream piled on top (not frothy), and tea is served without milk.
You can find hot chocolate that meets the true Belgian standards. Although the fruit juices taste great, the price is expensive.
There are underwater trips available all year round, and injuries arising from these causes are rarely encountered in underwater cliffs.
In any case, follow all the rules and pay attention to signs that provide safety warnings, and take advice from the authorities.
Box jellyfish appear in the north of the 1770 district near beaches and river basins from October to April. It is also possible to encounter them outside this period.
