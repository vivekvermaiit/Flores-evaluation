This not only confirms that some dinosaurs also had feathers (a theory that was already well-known), but it also provides information that is generally not obtained from the study of fossils, such as color and 3D shape.
Scientists say that the color of the animals' wings was chestnut brown on top and below it appeared faded or carotene-colored.
This investigation also revealed how the development of wings occurred in birds.
The rachis, a developed shaft, is not visible in the wings of the dinosaurs, but other features of having wings – barbs and barbules – were present. Researchers suggest that the development of the rachis also evolved in a later stage just like other organs.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their purpose was not for flight but for regulating body temperature or merely for display. Researchers say that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample suggests that these are the feathers of an adult dinosaur, not a young one.
Researchers believe that although it has the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen's feathers resemble those of a large dinosaur rather than the drooping feathers of a chicken.

Traditionally, France is slightly behind in terms of voting technology: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and select a paper from which the photos of the candidates are already printed, then place the paper of their chosen candidate into an envelope.

Candidates can send their representatives to observe every stage of the process. Volunteers of the alliance count the votes, which is done under strict supervision and follows a specific method.

The pets that died after eating contaminated pet food had both cyanuric acid and melamine in their urine samples.
Researchers at the university said that the two compounds combine to form crystals that obstruct the functioning of the kidneys.
The researchers found crystals formed in the cat's urine due to the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid.
When compared using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the structure of this crystal was similar to that found in the urine of affected domestic animals.
I don't know whether you are aware of it or not, but most goods from Central America have come to this country duty-free.
Even then, 80 percent of our products were being subjected to tariffs in Central American countries. We will cure you. Our behavior is friendly.
This is not right; this is absolutely not okay.
We just want to say that you should treat us the way we treat you.

Schneider testified via videolink from his country's USAF base.
After the event on Wednesday, Carpendo participated in two individual races in the championship.
Their first race was the slalom, which they couldn't complete in their first attempt. Out of 116 competitors, 36 had the same result in this race.
Their second race was the giant slalom, in which they ranked 10th in the women's sitting group and their total run time was 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes less than Austria's Claudia Loesch who achieved first place, and 1:09.02 minutes less than Hungary's Zsófia Dani who secured the ninth place.
Among the women's sitting group, four skiers did not finish their race, and in the giant slalom, out of a total of 117 skiers, 45 did not receive a rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered the woman's mobile and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhoot Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.

When the car hit the house, three people were inside, but no one was injured.
However, the driver had a lot of injuries on his head.
The road was blocked for some time until the emergency service people extracted the driver from the red Audi TT in which the car had collided on the road.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was taken to Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital.
Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then on charges of her child's murder.
She is in custody for accusations and investigation, but her photo has been published so widely that it could potentially compromise any evidence seen.
In the UK, this is a common occurrence for some time. However, the judicial system in Scotland operates differently, and in the eyes of its court, bias caused by the publication of photos might be possible.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University wrote, "If journalists publish photos of any suspect, it means that they are walking on a dangerous path."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the entire prosecution, pointed out to the journalists that no comments will be made as long as the prosecution is in progress.
According to the information received, the documents will discuss the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to what was said, the other topic that was included involves the issue of the sacred future Jerusalem state and the Jordan Valley for both countries.

Yesterday, nine members were sworn into a new provisional electoral council (CEP).
This is Martel's fifth CEP in four years.
To guide the country towards new elections, the presidential commission last month recommended removing the chairperson of the former CEP from their position.
This commission was Martelly's response to the dissent that spread against the government in October.
This occasionally violent protest had started due to no elections being held since 2011.
There have been nearly 60 cases where iPods overheated and were damaged, out of which six caught fire and four people were slightly burnt.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it has information about 27 accidents related to equipment.
METI announced last week that it reported 34 incidents of overheating to Apple, which the company describes as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "truly unfortunate."

In the capital of the Philippines, Manila, a former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus and held Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza started shooting at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been released and six people have died so far.
Before this, six hostages were released, including children, elderly, and a photographer from the Philippines.
A photographer took the place of a woman among the hostages because the woman needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was later shot.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and made his future in the field of medicine.
She received training as an obstetrician and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins was working in the hospital, he began researching premature labor in his spare time.
Their research found that if a certain hormone is administered, the rate of lung maturity in the embryo increases.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Along with them, the wrestling champions also paid their tributes to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Even in this, she's unique like them. She was a resilient woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was strange like me... probably even more than me... I am attached to her and I will miss her a lot... I hope she is in a better place."
Out of the 1,400 people who participated in the poll before the 2010 federal election, the number of those who were against Australia becoming a republic was 8 percent higher compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed while campaigning during the 2010 federal election that her belief is that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Out of the people included in the poll, 34 percent expressed their opinion that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At the peak of the poll, 29 percent of the people surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The person who won the gold medal in the Olympic Games was supposed to swim in the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but due to their complaint, there became a doubt about whether their health is alright or not.
The medicine that was needed to cure the chest pain was prohibited in the game, so he/she was unable to take it.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, has discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
At the beginning of February, many people used different hardware and software to check its correctness, and an announcement was made on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets brought organic matter along with water to Earth, which could form proteins and be conducive to life.
Scientists are hoping to understand how planets are formed and, in particular, they want to know how the Earth was formed after comets collided with it.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his reign at the start of this year and last month signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.

It is believed that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
FAA claims that NextGen is a system which will fly airplanes on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
This air traffic controller uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the old ground-radar-based technology, to guide aircraft with great precision and provide pilots with highly accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided in Wembley and the ground rail service will not stop. Along with this, there will be no car parking and park-and-ride facilities available.
The fear of a lack of transportation increases the hope that without supporters, the team will be forced to play behind closed doors.
A study published in the Science journal on Thursday reveals that a new species of bird is developing on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have described a new species that has developed in just two generations, but the process typically takes much longer due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold is useful in all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into smaller sizes.
It can be pulled like a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or shaped into a sheet by folding.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes it is used for decoration in handwritten books with drawings, known as "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called the pH of a substance. You can make an indicator from red cabbage juice to identify it.
The juice of cabbage changes its color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The level of pH in the tested solution is determined according to the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton from which an electron has been removed (because a hydrogen atom contains one proton and one electron).
Rotate two pieces of dried mixture together, then press them into a ball shape with a clean and wet hand.
The moisture on the hand will react with the outer layer, which will feel very strange and will form a kind of coating.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets which were connected to a very well-arranged drainage system that disposed of the waste water.
Evidence has been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and in the houses of Santorini, Greece, that there were arrangements for the disposal of sewage water.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths that were meant for both men and women.
When you talk to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives your call and sends it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
A very large rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing it did for us was that traveling from one place to another, or transporting goods from one place to another, became extremely easy and fast.
This train, cars, and many other kinds of transport means were given to us.
Below it, there is a medium-sized species of feline that predates on medium-sized prey like rabbits, deer, and antelope.
There are several such small cat-like species creatures (including domestic cats) that hunt various types of small insects, mice, lizards, and bird-like creatures.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, meaning a special task that every cat has which prevents it from competition with others.
In the cat family, the lion is the most social and it lives in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult male lions and together with them, up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
In a large family, having many sisters and daughters, the women are often closely connected with each other.
The pride of lions is quite like that of a pack of wolves or dogs. It's quite surprising that the behavior of wolves or dogs is like that of lions (but not like that of other big cats) and all of this makes them very dangerous for hunting in the same manner.
A physically fit tiger can climb trees (but not very well), can jump, can leap far, and can pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) which includes lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four big cats can roar.
Just like a roaring lion roars with an open throat, a tiger's roar isn't like that but it seems as if someone is shouting irritably.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can catch, they will capture monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are smaller than them.
Scientists believe that where the prey of the ocelot is on the ground, the ocelot smells it, tracks it, and hunts it down.
At night, they can see clearly even in the dark, and they can move stealthily as well. The ocelot blends into its surroundings to hunt and pounces to capture its prey.
When a small group of living things (small population) separates from the main group (like when it moves towards a mountain or river, or when it reaches a new island and returning to their group becomes difficult), it finds itself in an environment different from before.
In this new environment, there are different types of resources and different types of competitors, so the new population will have to adapt in a new way to shape themselves so that they can become stronger competitors compared to the previous needs.
The population that existed before does not change even a little, they still need to remain the way they were before.
With time, as the new population starts to adapt to its new environment, it gradually appears less and less like the other population.
Slowly, after thousands of years, or even millions of years, both populations will appear so different from each other that they will not be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an event that cannot be stopped and is a very essential part of the evolutionary process.
Trees and plants produce oxygen which humans breathe in, and they take in the carbon dioxide that we exhale.
Trees and plants make their food from the sunlight, which is called photosynthesis. They also provide us with shade.
We make our homes and clothes from trees. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants and trees, living beings cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of its time, which is why it feared no one, except for other Mosasauruses.
It had 70 sharp teeth like a razor in its long jaws, and the same number of teeth were on the upper side in its mouth. Meaning, once it got into the mouth, the prey's chances were absolutely gone.
We do not know for sure, but perhaps its tongue was bifid. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it was a cannibal too.
This creature wouldn't leave alone any creature that entered the water, even if it was a large dinosaur, and T. Rex doesn't stand a chance against it.
We might be familiar with many things consumed by Romans, but their feasts included some distinct and unique types of food, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent known as dormouse.
Another difference was that while on one hand, poor people and women would sit on chairs to eat, on the other hand, wealthy people, when organizing feasts, would eat reclining on their side.
The food of ancient Rome would not include all those things that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For instance, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The people of Babylon first built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of gods.
People were bringing sacrifices for God and the priest was fulfilling the needs of God through rituals and festivals.
Every temple had a courtyard and inside there was a holy place where only the priests could go.
Sometimes, over part of the temple, special pyramid-shaped towers were built. These towers were called ziggurats.
At the top of this tower, there was a sacred place for God.
Homes have no importance in the hot climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family spent most of their life in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; in the street, a table was set up like an open shop. Stones were being used for building the house.
There wasn't any large forest on Canon's land, so wood was very expensive there.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse saga, it is said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and when he went further west, he discovered Greenland, and it was named so.
But the Eskimo tribe had already been living there before he started searching.
Even though all the countries were 'Scandinavian', there were many differences in people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, then you might find that a treasure map was made behind the Declaration of Independence.
Anyway, this is not the truth. There's something written behind that document, but it is not a treasure map.
Behind the declaration of independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. This text was written upside down at the bottom of the document.
It is not exactly known who wrote this, but it is known that this large (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) leather document was folded to be preserved.
Thus, it can be assumed that this inscription was affixed merely like a label.
The northern part of France was liberated after the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, but the south had still not been freed.
This region was under the rule of the French "Vichy." They were the ones who, in 1940, had entered into a peace agreement with Germany and, instead of fighting the invaders, collaborated with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allied countries attacked the south of France. This was called "Operation Dragoon."
Within just two weeks, America and liberated France together freed Southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is called a culture that connects a large group of people who live together, work together, and create a society.
The word 'civilization' comes from the Latin language 'civilis', which means citizen. It is related to the Latin 'civis', which means citizen, and 'civitas', which means city or city-state. In a way, it also describes the structure of a society.
The development of countries happened from city-states. A culture associated with civilization means knowledge is passed from one generation to another, culture continues from one generation to another, and it spreads.
Minor cultures perish without leaving any historical evidence and are unable to establish their identity as a civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states came together to form a weak central government for the first time - in which Congress was the sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have any right to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on the state officials to enforce its rules, and those officials never cooperated.
It did not have any authority to override the tax laws and duties between the states.
Changes in the articles required the consensus of all the states and the central government took it so lightly that most of their representatives were absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was also the winner of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
In the northern regions, winter sports are the most popular, where Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world.
Being a group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The beginning of Taiwan happened in the 15th century when European sailors were passing through there and named it Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and began to introduce changes to the primitive methods of grain cultivation there. They started employing Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) military captured the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and in 1885 it was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, granting sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
In Machu Picchu, there are mainly three buildings, which are named Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and Room of the Three Windows.
Many buildings have been rebuilt on the perimeter of the complex, so that the onlookers can get an idea of how it looked when it was newly constructed.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was reconstructed and restored, and this work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for photographing stationary objects is 35 mm, which was the most predominantly used film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still made today, but it is certain that its aspect ratio is now found in the image sensors of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually misleading because its width is 36 mm and its height is 24 mm.
In this format, the aspect ratio (to get a whole number by dividing by twelve) is called 3:2 in this manner.
Generally, several formats (for example, APS family's formats) have aspect ratios like, or equal to, this.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and joked about, is a simple guideline for creating dimensions in an image without distorting its size.
According to this, the best place for the main subject is where lines that divide the picture into three horizontal and vertical sections meet (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very rich and powerful, began to have its property and activities scrutinized.
For thousands of years, despite differences in language and customs, the Christian religion united the states of Europe in a single bond.
This omnipresent force had an effect on everyone, whether they were kings or subjects.
A principle of the Christian religion is that money should be used to help people who are going through a crisis and to alleviate poverty. This is especially why money is collected by the church.
The central authority of the Church in Rome has existed for thousands of years. This congregation of power and money raises many questions about whether the principles upon which it was founded are being fulfilled or not.
Immediately after the start of the war, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although this kind of blockade has generally been considered a breach of international law agreements and understandings for the past two centuries, this strategy was successful in preventing the military and civilians from accessing essential supplies.
To prevent ships from entering the entire sea area, Britain mined the international waters, which also posed a threat to those ships that were not involved in the war.
Because there was very little response to this strategy, Germany was hoping for a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude of most citizens and countries was inclined towards pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, all the countries expressed a desire to avoid such situations again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to America to work at Edison Company located in New York City.
He reached America with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation that Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) had written to recommend him to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a completely unique way of observing different times. It portrayed each era of China, or each dynasty ruling, as a separate dynasty.
And there was such an unstable time between the two royal families when the state was divided. It was the era of the three most well-known states that lasted for 60 years between the Haan and Jin royal families.
In this period, there was a fierce struggle among many wealthy political people for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the period of the Three Kingdoms was the most violent time. During this period, thousands of people were killed to sit on the largest and highest throne of the Xian Palace.
Various types of social and political effects occurred, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from autocracy to republic, changes in nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just a single king.
Besides this, after the revolution, employment became available for all male applicants, which opened the path to success for those who aspired to progress and achieve success.
This was the situation in the army as well because ranking in the army began to be based on merit rather than on class basis.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working class people of other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad took a great interest in matters beyond this worldly life. For some contemplation and reflection, he often went to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light).
In the flow of time, from this preserved cave, a very vivid and detailed image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination is obtained.
The cave situated on the top of a mountain in the hills north of Mecca is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, even after knowing that there is a cave, it is not easy to find it. Once a person enters the cave, they become completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Nothing else could be seen apart from the clear, beautiful sky above and several mountains around. Once inside the cave, very little of the outside world could be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders which still stands today in the same manner.
The Great Pyramid built by the people of Egypt three centuries before Christ is one of the many pyramids made in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
In the Valley of the Kings of Egypt, located on the Giza plateau or "Giza Necropolis," there are several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest). There are also several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx here.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
"The 'Up bow' resembles the letter V, and the 'Down bow' resembles a staple, or like a square that looks as if its bottom part is missing."
Up means that you should start from above and push the bow, and down means you should start from the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Up bow often produces a soft sound, whereas down bow is strong and outspoken.
Do not hesitate to make your mark with a pencil, but remember that the marks it leaves are made for a reason, so take care of them.
On October 6, 1789, the crowd of women in the marketplace frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, and forcibly sent them from Versailles to Paris.
The vehicle in which they were returning to Paris was surrounded by a crowd on all sides, and this crowd was chanting threatening slogans against the king and queen.
The crowd was forcing the king and queen to keep the car window open.
Once, a man from the crowd started waving the severed head of a porcupine protector in front of the scared queen.
The expenses of the war by imperialistic America in the victory over the Philippines were borne by the people of the Philippines.
A large part of their expenses had to be given as taxes to the colonial rule of America and interest was charged on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
However, the American imperialism benefited the most from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, it is first necessary to understand why this order was established.
The era in which all these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, and it was a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The period before the High Middle Ages is called the Early Middle Ages and the period after is referred to as the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses various ideas that are used. From technological advancement or technological necessity to a serious mindset, where it is assumed that human life operates on a logic driven by scientific laws and that technology is integrated into every aspect of life.
People who understand technological determinism more often present two ideas: that technological development finds its own path beyond cultural or political influence, and also that technology in turn leaves its "impact" on the society that inherently adopts it, not on the society that is socially conditioned for it.
For example, someone could say that because of cars, it's necessary to develop the roads.
However, the extensive road network spread throughout the country is not economically necessary just for a few cars, which is why a new method of car manufacturing is developed to reduce the cost of buying and maintaining cars.
When a large number of people buy cars, it can lead to an increase in the number of accidents on the road. This highlights the need for the development of new technologies that can reduce the cost of repairing damaged cars.
There is an element of cultural determinism in naturalism that has been taken from writers like Goethe, Schiller, and Schleiermacher.
In the context of naturalism, geography molded people according to its own terms, and over time, customs and cultures linked with that geography were born. Because these new customs and cultures were developed according to the place in society, they were better than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the world today, similarly, in feudal Europe, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital.
This was considered the hub of luxury items, and its status remained from around the 4th century BC to approximately 1100 BC.
Its status began to decline around the twelfth century because the Crusaders returned the priceless gifts they had brought, such as silk clothes and spices. The reason behind this was that the price of these items was so high that selling them in the Byzantine market was not feasible.
This was the time when Paris began to take the place of Constantinople, which was called the capital of fashion.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, these clothes were greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, the means of communication at that time were slow, hence the styles of the West were 25 to 30 years behind when compared to the East.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. Among the major events of that time was the fact that due to the crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes tightly.
Subsistence farming is a type of farming in which the farmer grows crops only to support and sustain his family.
The usual farming is traditional and mostly organic farming, in which seeds of the crop grown in the same place are used. To get the maximum yield, crop rotation or any other simple method is utilized.
Historically, many farmers were involved in subsistence farming, and even now, such farming occurs in many progressive countries.
A subculture is a group of people with similar thinking who are ignored based on social standards. They get an identity from the subculture.
The members of a subculture can vary based on age, caste, class, location, and gender.
The characteristics on which a subculture can be distinguished are language, interests, religion, politics, gender, geography, or several other factors.
Members of a subculture express their membership in a unique way and as a signal. This signal can be in the form of fashion, style, or manner of speaking.
To understand the importance of socialization, the most common method used is to learn about such unfortunate children who, when growing up, were either mistreated by adults, neglected, or not socialized.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are kept in one place or restrained by people (often their parents); in some cases, due to inadequate intellectual and physical development, their parents abandon them.
The changed children either released them or had already fled, having endured a lot of oppression and trauma.
Some are said to have raised animals, while some are believed to have lived alone in the jungle.
When any feral child is completely raised by non-human (animal), then the behavior of those children is almost entirely (within physical limits) like those animals, especially like the animals that take care of them, such as being scared of humans or becoming indifferent to them.
Learning based on the project is easier and more fun, but scaffolding is one step ahead of even that.
Scaffolding is not just a method of learning, but it also helps those people who want to learn something new, like any computer program, or are starting a new project.
A scaffold can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher can be a scaffold, as well as a small paperclip man from Microsoft Office can also be a scaffold.
Virtual scaffold software is an internal component whose purpose is to ask questions, provide hints, and explain in ways that a student may have difficulty understanding on their own.
For several reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even forced circumstances, children are sent to care centers.
No child should grow up in an environment where there is no nourishment, care, and education, but children are growing up in such an environment.
We consider the care center a safe place for such children.
We should have a care center system that provides love for children, takes care of them, offers stable educational arrangements, and reliable health facilities.
A care center should provide all the necessary things that the children needed before they came here.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interactive communication.
Due to the very distinct characteristics of the internet, its usage and personal satisfaction show a separate perspective.
For example, “education” and “socialization” are considered very important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
When Amy and McCord (1998) examined audience reactions to websites, they found that "personal connection" and "attempts to advance relationships" are also a new kind of inspiration for the Internet.
Several important discoveries have been made in the field of analyzing small facial expressions (micro-expressions) and facial movements using video recording.
Especially, if someone correctly understands the small expressions (micro-expressions) that appear on the face, they can tell whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks mentioned in his paper, The President's Speech, that due to damage in the brain, people who cannot understand spoken words are still able to perceive the truth of a statement.
He went as far as to say that the ability to understand human behavior is also there in pet dogs.
A research conducted in the twentieth century revealed that genetic variation is of two types: hidden and apparent.
Mutation brings new genetic variations, and due to natural selection, this open variation is removed from the pool.
Variations between two groups occur back and forth in each generation through segregation and recombination.
In the savanna, primates with a digestive system similar to humans find it difficult to meet the amino acid requirements from the plants there.
The consequence of not meeting this need is serious: underdevelopment of the body, malnutrition, and premature death.
Protein can be obtained from the leaves and pods of the most easily available trees and plants, but like us, primates also cannot digest it by eating it raw.
However, it can be digested without any problem without animal food (ants, termites, eggs) and it also provides a substantial amount of proteins with essential amino acids.
After thinking over all this, there is no surprise in the fact that our ancestors also used to meet their "protein needs" in the same way as the chimps in the savanna do today.
Disruption in sleep, waking up in the middle of sleep, and then going back to sleep after some time (10-60 minutes) is a normal process.
This task can be easily done with the help of a low-noise alarm clock. The clock brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you have a habit of resetting the alarm clock's alarm in your sleep, then the clock can be kept in the other corner of the room. This way, to turn off the clock, you will have to get out of bed.
For another biorhythm method, one should drink a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which are considered diuretics) before sleeping, so that you have to get up for urination during sleep.
The amount of peace within a person is inversely proportional to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less the stress, the more positive thoughts there will be in life. Every person can keep themselves completely calm and satisfied.
Every person can attain nirvana. It is only because of internal stress and negative thinking that attaining nirvana becomes difficult.
Buddhism in Tibet is based on the teachings of Lord Buddha, which expanded through the path of love of the Mahayana sect and the Indian yogic scriptures.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. It includes the principles of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and love for everyone.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of knowledge) is awakened through yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and spiritual insight.
In Tibetan meditation, the divine yoga has primary importance. Through visualizing different deities, energy is purified, the chakras are awakened, and knowledge consciousness is activated.
In the Second World War, Germany was an enemy of both the USSR and America, which led to an alliance between them. After the war ended, differences in systems, processes, and cultures caused the countries to become divided.
Two years after the war ended, old friends had now become enemies and a cold war had begun.
It lasted for the next 40 years and this war was actually fought by various proxy armies across regions from Africa to Asia, in battlefields like Afghanistan, Cuba, and several other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was shattered, and only the hope of retreating and regrouping with the Romanian front remained.
However, in just one night this plan was rendered useless when, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and several other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Eastern Poland with 800,000 soldiers and entered the Belarus and Ukraine fronts.
The best way to transport goods and people from one place to another in the sea is by water ships.
The traditional task of the navy was to ensure that the country's people and goods are transported correctly from one place to another and to cause disruption to enemy nations in this task.
The best example of this in recent times was the WWII campaign of the North Atlantic. To help Britain, America was trying to transport people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that exact time, Germany was trying to stop the traffic using U-boats.
If the Allied Powers had lost, Germany would likely have conquered Britain because the rest of Europe was already with them.
It seems that goats were first domesticated on the Zagros Mountains of Iran almost 10,000 years ago.
The people of ancient culture and tribes started keeping them easily to obtain milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Goats that are raised often used to be kept in herds and roam in mountainous or grazing areas. They were mostly tended by young boys or slightly older boys, who are today called shepherds. This method of raising animals is still used today.
Wagonways were constructed in England in the 16th century.
Although there were only planks of wood fitted face to face in the cart, the horse was able to pull it faster on the uneven road and could carry more load.
The use of cross ties to keep the tracks in place had started quite early. However, gradually, it was realized that if there was an iron strip on the top, the track would remain much better.
This became a common issue, but the wooden wheels of the wagon wore out more due to the iron.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rail was started.
Walking was the first mode of transportation. Humans started walking upright on two legs around 2 million years ago with the beginning of Homo erectus (meaning a person who stands upright and walks on two legs).
Before them, Australopithecus could not walk upright in this manner.
Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago showed specialization for two legs, but Sahelanthropus from 7 million years ago could also walk on two legs.
We can start living in such a way that causes the least harm to the environment, we can participate in the environmental movement, and to some extent, we can also be activists to reduce the pain of the future.
In many cases, it is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It has become quite clear that due to the scientific and technological development of the human race, the world has changed a lot, and due to the large population and extraordinary lifestyle of the human race, problems have increased even more.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, the draft was written by hand and was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, and it was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away for printing.
Throughout the night, between 150 to 200 copies of it were issued, which is now known as "Dunlop Broadsides".
On July 8, for the first time, John Nixon read it out in front of everyone in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read out to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on July 10.
There are still 25 copies of Dunlop Broadside, which is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider it a dinosaur because it has wings and it can fly.
But there are still many things in birds today that seem like dinosaurs.
They have feet with joints and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Nowadays, almost all computers in use are based on processing information here and there, which is coded in the form of binary numbers.
In a binary number, only one of the two values can exist, either 0 or 1, and in the terminology of computers, they are called binary digits or bits.
The presence of any poison inside cannot be immediately detected. Symptoms like vomiting are very common, and it cannot be immediately identified from them.
A spilled container of medicine or any household toxic chemical can be the best indication of a poison spreading inside.
For specific poison emergency treatment instructions, refer to the label on the container.
Entomologists use the word 'bug' in a formal sense to describe insect groups.
This word, in ancient times, was used in conversation and is derived from the word bed-bug. This bug is also clever at living and growing on the human body.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs, both insects are called nidicoles because wherever they are born (on the host's body), they stay there permanently.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout America, making it the main neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research reveals that the likelihood of getting MS is twice as high in women compared to men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not in their or their child's best interest.
This couple has decided to give their child up for adoption.
By adopting, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to see that the world operates in a scientific manner. Most scientific research actually shows this way.
It is not used only for this purpose, but experimentation and tests like this eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. In this, by asking questions and making observations, the direction of scientific research is given.
Naturists and philosophers focused on ancient and high-quality books, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of the people of Greece diminished, the connection with Western Greek philosophy and science came to an end.
Certain rhythms and behaviors of physiology often depend very specifically on the internal cycles created by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythm that does not depend solely on external periodic signals has been noted for most living organisms such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is like a self-maintained pendulum that completes its cycle on its own, even without receiving external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was a major suggestion in proposing that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a phage or virus to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, either tagging the DNA in the phase with radioactive phosphorus, or tagging the protein in the phase with radioactive sulfur.
Based on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germ-line cell or not, mutations can have several different kinds of effects.
Mutations occurring in germ-line cells are passed on to children, whereas mutations occurring elsewhere can either lead to cell death or cause cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts those people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the experience of seeing the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of activities that can be done at that place include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
An example is seeing the orangutans in Borneo, taking photos, and learning about them.
Every morning, people leave the small towns to go to their workplaces in the cities, passing by those whose workplaces are right there, places they have just left behind.
In this dynamic transportation setup, everyone is connected in some way or another and it supports a transport system based on personal reasons.
Science indicates that due to this large carbon economy, the biosphere, which has contributed to human development for the past two million years, has moved from its stable state.
Every man participates in society and utilizes the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, hardly ever do you hear complaints about the quality of water or incidents like a bridge collapsing.
Why does the transportation system give such opportunities for complaints, why does it fail on a daily basis? Are the transport engineers completely incompetent? Or is there some other fundamental reason for it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of different drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with hundred percent accuracy.
However, by fate, the driver behaves reasonably within a sensible consistent limit; hence, there is some reasonable stability in the traffic stream and it can roughly be represented mathematically.
To accurately represent the flow of traffic, a relationship has been established among three main factors: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relates to assisting in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
The insects were the first creatures to fly in the air. The ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and partners more skillfully.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings back against their bodies.
It provides small spaces to hide from their hunters.
Nowadays, there is only one kind of insect that cannot fold back its wings, it is the dragonfly and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus had said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought that they were right, but many believed the opposite that the solar system revolves around the Earth, which includes the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems right because it doesn't feel like the earth moves. Do you think it does?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, which sometimes becomes six miles wide.
Twenty percent of all the water that flows from rivers to the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of ancient empires, none could surpass the size and technical design of the Giza pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the least population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official correspondence.
Italian is also a language of everyday use, which most people working in the state use, whereas Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can be found in their natural form and easily extracted from the ground with primitive tools.
A philosopher named Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is made from a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
The four states of this substance (in this order) were: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also proposed this theory that all these turn into new substances and take on such forms that we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals too, like silver and gold.
Such alloys can also exist in which a small amount of non-metal elements like carbon is mixed.
Everything in the universe is made up of some or other substance. All substances are made up of tiny particles that are called atoms.
An atom is so small that billions of atoms can fit into the full stop at the end of this sentence.
Hey buddy, when the pencil was first made, people liked it a lot.
It is a matter of regret that as new methods of writing keep emerging, the use and presence of the pencil are diminishing.
People now write messages on computer screens, which reduces the use of pencils.
It is a matter of thought that when something new comes, what will happen to the keyboard.
A fusion bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to keep multiple protons and neutrons together in a nucleus.
Like driving a heavy vehicle uphill. The nucleus should be broken again and some energy should be extracted from it.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they break apart very easily or without any pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thick below the bottom of the ocean and thin below the highlands.
More hits could possibly occur near the area because the crust is thin. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The material theory focuses on finding out what things people like or are interested in.
This principle explains that people have certain desires or needs that, with adulthood, become a part of their personality.
These theories consider why people desire something and what factors in their environment cause them to want or not want to do something.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally, when managers get the opportunity to lead their old colleagues, two types of behavior can be observed. One of them could be being considered as "one of your own team members."
Such managers have difficulty making decisions that people don't like, enforcing rules, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
In another type of behavior, the person who becomes a manager becomes a completely different person. They feel that they should change everything the team does and want to keep control over everything.
Because, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often creates a rift between the leaders and other team members.
The quality of work of virtual teams is measured by the same standards as the evaluation of traditional teams' work, but there are definitely slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for their physical team.
Compared to members of the traditional team, they often have more freedom because their team can meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
In the true sense, the presence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would any organization choose a method that takes a lot of time to build an educational institution? Bringing the concept of organizational learning into practice is a goal for new change.
When all resources available in the departments of an organization are used effectively, it gives rise to creativity and simplicity.
For example, when an organization works together to overcome any obstacle, a new approach is developed to meet customer needs.
For any organization to work in a new way, it is necessary that its leaders develop a culture of new exploration, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum method as a way that organizations can work more effectively.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical investigation of consciousness. This reduces the scope of exploration and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior assists scientists in their research.
It is known for a long time that injury, trauma, wounds, and tumors in the brain affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
With the advent of new technology, there has been an opportunity to observe and examine the structure and functioning of the brain in ways that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to create a simulation model that helps in understanding how the brain works.
Although AI has a very different meaning in science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
AI research is done to create machines that can perform tasks requiring intelligence on their own.
As like, controlling, planning and making programs, understanding the reasons for the troubles of the consumer, and with the ability to respond, recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
This has become a completely different subject, which emphasizes providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, like the software in home computers and video games.
A field trip is a big part of any class. Often a teacher prefers to take their students to a place where the bus cannot go.
A solution to this is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can sit with their class and view the artifacts of a museum, see an aquarium, or admire beautiful artworks.
Sharing a virtual field trip along with a future class is a wonderful way to consider any trip and share experiences.
For instance, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is revamped, but the old versions are kept online like a scrapbook.
A blog can also help students improve their writing. However, students often make grammatical and spelling mistakes in their initial blog posts, but the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to try to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging together provides "students with more information about the world around them." To increase audience interest, students are inspired to write blogs that are good and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond traditional school education.
The proper use of blogs "can encourage students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to content available on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of others' writing and also prepare an outline of their opinion on specific issues (Orevek, 2002).
Ottawa is the attractive, bilingual capital of Canada, where there are many art galleries and museums showcasing the past and present of Canada.
And in the south is Niagara Falls, and in the north is Muskoka, and beyond that, the beauty of nature spreads.
These and several other reasons make Ontario the best place in Canada for outsiders.
In its north, there is a vast area with a very sparse population, and in some parts, there are nearly deserted forests.
The comparison of populations which is likely to surprise many is this: the number of African Americans living in the United States is more than the total number of citizens in Canada.
The East African island is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
When talking about wildlife, Madagascar is still the largest and a continent in itself.
Most small islands are independent nations or are associated with France, and all of these are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also landed on this land of Islam, and they captured the Comoros and Mayotte on a large scale.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, this region is surrounded by the coast, and in the south and west, it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
It is recommended that any woman, without worrying about her correct marital status, should say that she is married.
Wearing a ring is also very helpful (not just the one that looks very expensive).
Women should understand that due to cultural differences, what they consider harassment, such as being followed, having their hand held, etc., are normal things.
Do not hesitate to reject men and stand firm on your point without any fear (whether the culture is different or not, this is not right in any way!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but after the 1755 earthquake, they abandoned it.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt this city as Daru El-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least favorite places in all of Morocco for shopping.
It is easy to find places near old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, clay pots, leather goods, hookahs, and various types of gigaws, but all these are only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located east of Rwanda.
In the year 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed due to the Nyiragongo volcano. This volcano turned the roads and the main parts of the nearby city into debris.
It is safe to roam around in Goma city, but if you want to explore outside, first investigate the surrounding areas and understand that there is a conflict situation in the North Kivu province.
This city is a base camp for climbing the dormant volcanoes and other small mountains in Africa for mountain gorillas.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to move around Goma. For short distances, you will typically need to spend about ~500 Congolese Francs in the local currency.
With its relative obscurity, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for a foreign, distant land.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, but due to its own prestige, it is a center of attraction for tourists. There is also an airport here.
In 1990, it was included in the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
During the PBS special "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates, this was one of the major highlights.
This city is completely opposite to all the other cities in the country, because it has more Arabic characteristics than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a unique wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered prominent among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
There is a daily conservation and entrance fee for all South African national parks.
Buying a wild card can be beneficial for someone, as it grants access to any of the popular South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the region of Hong Kong and is considered the main tourist focus by several places to visit.
The parade of the skyline buildings of Hong Kong is compared to a magnificent bar chart which is made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on the reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that was taken over by British colonizers and if you are searching for evidence of the colonial past of the region, then it is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, which extends up to 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian interior regions.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area within India's territory is known as the Sundarban National Park.
This forest is not just a mangrove swamp—it includes some of the last surviving stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is comprised of water/marshy areas.
Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
All buses leave throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (across the river), although most buses, especially those going east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Most of the buses running in the district are full, so it is better to book your ticket a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese coaster buses operate, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200) are a quick and comfortable means of traveling to nearby places.
Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It extends across the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapok in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of these two towers is 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is set to become operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group that now resides in eastern Paraguay; these people lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for their sustenance.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous tribes and other groups such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who hunted for survival and gathered together to fish.
In the 16th century, the birth of Paraguay, which was previously called "the vast province of the Indies," occurred due to conflicts between Spanish settlers and indigenous groups.
The Spaniard started the colonial period which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in maintaining its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for being one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field of Las Canitas.
Other times of the year, small tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
For information on tournament news and where to get tickets, please refer to the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
On this island, there is only one bank where money can be exchanged. This bank is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West Store.
British pounds are accepted almost everywhere on the island and steadily with credit cards, and United States dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards might not be accepted on the outer islands, but British and United States currencies may be taken; to determine the acceptable payment method, check with the owners in advance.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so you should exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it experiences summer while, conversely, the northern hemisphere experiences winter.
Montevideo is in a subtropical area; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are normal.
Winter can deceptively feel cold: the temperature hardly ever goes below the freezing point, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder compared to the thermometer reading.
There isn't any specific "rainy" and "dry" season here: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, even then, wildlife is wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, one should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other animals.
It doesn't matter how calm they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and all big animals can harm us.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not maintain a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so keep your distance from them.
It is also important to keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid taking scented food items with you and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is on the island of Upolu and its population is slightly less than 40,000.
The city was established in 1950 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
Except for a British cruiser, all ships sank. About 200 American and German people lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupu Taumasi Liloaofi III.
Due to the meeting of two harbors in Auckland, many beaches have been formed. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beach located on the northern shore (in the North Harbour district) lies in the Pacific Ocean, extending from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Here, almost all the beaches have sand where swimming is safe, and most beaches have the shade of coconut trees.
Tamaki Drive is located on the Waitemata Harbour amidst all the beaches, in the bustling suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes there is a lot of hustle and bustle at this family beach where a line of very nice shops is set up along the shore. Swimming here is considered very safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but rather pleasant and fresh. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines here, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be much better.
The local tap water is completely safe, but if you are worried, bottled water is easily available.
Australians are not familiar with 'Flat White' coffee. A short black is called 'Espresso', the cup of cappuccino comes filled to the top with cream (without froth) and tea is served without milk.
