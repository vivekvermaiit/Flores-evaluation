USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and agrees on the absolute need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes in the Olympic family.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how violence of the proportion so courageously described by the survivors of Larry Nassar could remain undetected for so long and eagerly accepts all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal — to make sports like gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides us with details that fossils generally cannot give, such as their colors and their three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with a straw or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides a first glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed structure, called a rachis, but instead have other feather features — barbules and barbs — the researchers inferred that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for the regulation or visualization of temperature. The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not that of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not chick fluff.
A car that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.
The governor's office stated that nineteen of the injured people were police officers.
The police stated that they suspected a supposed Daesh (ISIL) militiaman of being responsible for the attack.
They found that the Sun operated according to the same basic principles as the other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was conditioned by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is linked to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number is, the less active the star is concerning magnetic inversions.

The work done was essentially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way similarly exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory claims that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is situated around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
During an interview, he stated that the new variant was "extremely concerning and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have caught the virus at the hospital, thinks Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people who have tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

The infrared images show that the variations in temperature from night to day likely indicate the presence of caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as consistent as in the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing, from the astrogeology team of the American Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.

After the verification by the officials of the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.

His first was the slalom, where he scored a Did Not Finish in his first race. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who finished in first place and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers from the women's group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and the mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and her laptop."
The accused are identified under the names of Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been charged at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is held pending her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be tainted by the fact that her image has been extensively published.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently and courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes "journalists truly seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which generally handles legal actions, has informed journalists that no additional comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on those from before the Middle East War of 1967.
Other topics that would have been addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters of the additional test to control harmful populations had to be closely monitored by the guards, as the test was supervised and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the framework of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.

Martelly was sworn in before a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures that will lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan said that he had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 in the morning local time (9:19 in the evening GMT on Friday).
The emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands declared that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shocked.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During the time he worked at the hospital, Liggins began studying premature labor during his free time.
Her research demonstrated that if a hormone was administered it would accelerate the fetal lung of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" recorders from the flight on Wednesday.
The wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. It is truly unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as troubled as I was... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her ... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this point of view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of the surveyed individuals believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of them believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle categories and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition has been put into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain since they were banned for the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number so far on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using computer materials and software since the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could possibly have been the source of water supply to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly how the Earth was formed, ever since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his role as governor at the beginning of the year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political blah blah and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that according to the FAA would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of an airplane with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and surface trains will not stop at Wembley and the parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable on site.
The fear of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of birds on the equatorial Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though this process was thought to take longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked to make all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled well into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and embedded in another metal. It can be made so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (base) of the chemical product.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical product tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix both dry powders together then, with clean and damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give you a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had wells with water in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of toilet systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes a part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
As soon as you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to Earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket of more than 100 feet high is needed to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to provide us with a much easier and faster means of transport.
The train, the car, and many other means of transportation have brought us.
Below them, there are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including wandering domestic cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the little chapel, a special task that each cat has and which prevents them from entering into competition with the others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
Lion groups are composed of one to three adult males from the same family, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely bonded to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
The groups of lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with a force five times that of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a phrase of reborn and howled words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by their scent, sniffing where they have passed on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from where they came (such as crossing a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and rivals, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. The majority of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most important predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra row in the roof of its mouth, which meant there was no way to escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a strong tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that it was even a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; and even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex wouldn't have stood a chance against it.
Even if most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual festive elements, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food seated on chairs, the rich men enjoyed having banquets together where they lay sprawled on their sides while eating their meals.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered as the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes there were special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
The majority of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were nothing but open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no significant forests in the land of Canaan, and therefore wood was extremely expensive there.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. It is told in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland because of a murder and, when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But beyond its discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Even though each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences among the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it's not true. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th of July 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, on the backside.
Even though no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its life, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
And so, it is likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not free yet.
It was governed by the French from "Vichy." They were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded the south of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American forces and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, a relative of the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means town or city-state, and which also defines in a certain way the dimension of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over various generations, a persistent cultural weight, and equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as individual civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time—the Congress was its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the powers to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to implement all its decisions.
He also had no authority to override the fiscal laws and tariffs between the states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, together with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the entire world and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh-largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, from a geographic point of view, an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the practices of local grain production and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal regions of the west and north of Taiwan and declared that Taiwan was a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
Around 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the entire world is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, in a somewhat surprising way, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is thus said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is quite often overused and frequently ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates dynamism while simultaneously preserving a measure of order within an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had connected European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and that concentration of power and money made many people wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after hostilities broke out, Great Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined the international waters to prevent all ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing dangers even to neutral vessels.
Given that there was a limited response to that tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his employer in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing the different periods of time; each era of China or each family that was in power represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place among many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, to nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and brilliant to succeed.
It is the same for the military because instead of having army ranks based on the class, they were now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (the light) for contemplation.
The very cave, which survived through time, provides a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy at all to find even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Not much of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that is still standing today.
Constructed by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), various small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "high arch" symbol looks like a V, and the "low arch" symbol looks like a bracket or a square missing the bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A high bow usually generates a softer sound, while a low bow is stronger and more assertive.
You should feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI terrified, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789, were sent back from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to have the windows of their carriage completely open.
At one moment, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to repay much of the expenses and the interests on the bonds issued in the name of the Filipino government through the banks of Wall Street.
Certainly, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era during which these events took place is usually known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the beginning of the Middle Ages and followed by the end of the Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that man's destiny is carried by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the very development of technology follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be asserted that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a network of national roads is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, and thus new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new care techniques to repair bodily damage.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the customs and culture linked to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place in society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was perceived as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the 12th century mainly because the crusaders returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices which had more value than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that moment that the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic art reached its peak during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major advances of that era is that as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming carried out to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using seeds preserved from the native ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, many peasants were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in several developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as being distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which can include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults during their developmental years.
Children like that are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (generally their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment was due to the parent's rejection of a severe intellectual or physical deficiency in a child.
It is possible that the wild children had suffered violence or severe trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or having run away.
Some others are said to have been raised by animals; it is said that some lived in the wild alone.
When completely raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within their physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the specific adoptive animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
Even if project-based learning should be the easiest and most interesting way to learn, the stage goes a step further.
L'Empont is not a learning method but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals experiencing a new learning experience, such as by using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stages can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of stage but it is also the case of the Microsoft Office paperclip.
Virtual Scaffolds are internalized in the software and serve to question, to stimulate, and to explain procedures that might have been too complex for the student to handle alone.
The children are placed in foster care for a significant variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, attentive, and educational, but they do.
We perceive the Foster Care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The host families are supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the household from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continued relationships” were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, the facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who were unable to understand a speech due to brain damage were nonetheless able to assess sincerity with precision.
It further suggests that such capacities for interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has demonstrated that there are two reserves of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation in both directions between both pools in each generation.
In the savannah, it is hard for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its needs for amino acids from the resources available in plants.
Moreover, not doing so has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, worms, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they provide a large amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our very own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process that consists of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively discreet alarm to lead you towards consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm involve drinking a lot of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which requires getting up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were spread through the path of love of the Mahayana and by the powerful techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. From the end of the war, the confrontations of systems, processes, and culture led to a rupture between these countries.
After two years from the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fiercely contested, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already shattered, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Agression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the campaign in the North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used U-boats, was trying to stop that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often overseen by goatherds who were frequently children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These pastoral methods are still used today.
Railways were constructed in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the railroads simply consisted of parallel wooden posts, they allowed horses that pulled to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first entirely iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in the Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more respectfully towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
It's only like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should deactivate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and the problems have become larger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have a body covered in scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind limbs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, if we use computer jargon.
It is possible that internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
You need to check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs and assassin bugs are both nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or the dwelling of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to have a baby.
Those couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it's not just that, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
The opinions of Aristotle were accepted in all domains of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external signals, have been documented for the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a free-running operating cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by marking either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Each morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is precisely the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is in some way connected with and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution during the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why don't they function properly on a daily basis? Are the transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at play?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented in an approximate way.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established among the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them escape from their enemies more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus asserted that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
That seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes being six kilometers wide.
A 20 percent complete of the water that the rivers of the planet pour towards the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were in awe of the monuments of their predecessors, which were much older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the entire world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life for the majority of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since Antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made from a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it was also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You must not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
And so, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
It is sad, but with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and uses.
People now write messages on computers or on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a typewriter.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus and force protons and neutrons together.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again then releases a part of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to split with a little push or even less.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the opposite side.
It is finer under the sea and denser under the highlands.
There can be more seas on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what individuals choose or what interests them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized since they matured to adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them want to do the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One extreme of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or of the women).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, in exercising disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another one turned into a barely recognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and take credit for it.
Ultimately, the leader is the ultimate responsible party for the success and failure of his team.
This behavior very often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members since their teams can meet based on variable time zones that may not be understood by their local administration.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the procedure of an organization that works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and at the same time a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to research on cognition. Thus, it limits the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the scientists' research.
It has been known for some time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Even if artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such matters have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life everyday problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been built into various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. Quite often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual excursions. Students can look at artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium or admire fine art while seated with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also an excellent way to think about an excursion and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is revamped, but the older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Given that students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts making great efforts to improve their writings and avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to become more aware about the world around them." The need to nourish public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school days.
The proper use of blogs "can encourage students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on particular topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the pleasant bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a fine array of art galleries and museums that display the past and present of Canada.
The Niagara Falls are located much further south and the north is the region of the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered the quintessence of the Canadian identity by outsiders.
The larger expanses further north are rather sparsely populated, with some being almost uninhabited wilderness regions.
To make a comparison of population that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, and it established itself significantly in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route from the Cape of Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their true marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they might consider as harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You need to be firm when rejecting men, and do not be afraid to defend your territory (cultural differences or not, that is not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of knick-knacks, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near the Rwandan border.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the city, particularly the city center.
Even though Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
A boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) can be used to tour Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, even if its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the major stages during the PBS special broadcast Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the country's cities, because it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the emblematic brand of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, preservation and entrance fees must be paid daily for the park.
It can also be advantageous for someone to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to either select parks in South Africa or to all the national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as their main interest.
The array of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a bright bar graph that becomes apparent with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you need to leave the island and head towards the waterfront in Kowloon opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on the reclaimed lands along the north shore.
This is the place that the British colonists took as if it were theirs, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the Bangladeshi and Indian coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps though — they include some of the last remaining patches of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water or marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the inter-district buses are often full, it is advised to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017 when it is anticipated that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as seminomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the home of other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurus and Payaguás, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
During the 16th century, Paraguay, which was formerly called "the Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the entire world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To get news about the tournaments and find out where to buy tickets for the polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, even if British and American currencies may be taken; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical regions; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
Even if many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
It doesn't matter if they seem docile, the bison, the elk, the moose, the bears, and nearly all beautiful animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Moreover, you must be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded during the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have shaded areas provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxurious suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are family beaches, sometimes very frequented, with a good range of shops lined up along the coast. Swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an 'espresso', the cappuccino comes filled with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reefs are made throughout the year, and accidents caused by some of these causes on the reefs are rare.
However, you must follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear along the beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside those times.
The sharks really exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most of the sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives peace of mind to the traveler who will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, and you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or even some packages that combine flights with the hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the proposal or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example the visa).
Any kind of modification or request should however be notified through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants decide to camp on site, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to get up early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have ended, there can be sections of the festival that will continue playing music until late in the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in winter, you need to check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice causes a rather terrible noise for the most sensitive people.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make multiple efforts to maximize the time and money spent by clients. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special food and drinks and entertainment offerings to keep the customers in a good mood and keep them on site.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on site. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know that it is important to stay sober.
Those who are about to drive in high latitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to immobilize you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or wind-driven snow, by condensation, or by ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, the conditions under ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic flows almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to journeys by land to observe the magnificent African wildlife, particularly the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to gather near the cars and standard equipment will allow for good observation of them.
The lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you might have a disrupted situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most of the cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the competitions will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available to be borrowed, even if they are not present in the room.
If a flat iron is not available or if you do not really want to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
You must be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, serious burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are necessary.
The filters vary in effectiveness, and in case of doubt, you should then consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmless animals with which they are not familiar in their regions of origin.
Harmless animals can spoil food, cause irritations or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, do not fall into the category of harmful things.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase products exempt from taxes and special duties in certain places.
Travelers heading towards countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a calm mind: steep slopes, narrow roads, and tight turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections — often from 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Curiously, however, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German cakes are very good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
The fruits in the pastry shop are common, with baked apples in cakes all year round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cookies pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called, depending on the region, Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on aromatic herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian gastronomy is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found across the nation.
However, when used without any other qualifier, the term tends to mean the food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors favored by the Javanese being peanuts, peppers, sugar (particularly palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can cause safety concerns due to the potential for the rider's feet to get trapped in them.
If a horseman is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a good number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most of the horse riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, rather narrow sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to come off the saddle if a rider is pulled backward by a falling horseman.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and domes.
The summits include breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world continuously establish new routes there amid its infinite potential of walls.
Snow downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on a snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient — paintings in caves depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: this activity is also called ski touring, ski touring, or ski excursions.
He is a relative but usually does not understand alpine skiing excursions or mountaineering, the latter carried out on steep terrain requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
You must think of the ski itinerary as a similar hiking itinerary.
In good conditions, you can cover relatively greater distances than when walking – but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls many times.
The Schengen area, however, functions to some extent like a country in this case.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each individual Schengen member country separately, and thus you save time, money, and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition is subject to geographical variations, as the age limit could be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Artisan products could be defined as ancient, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important resource for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also significant for many who have other professions.
And traditionally, not all the Sámi have participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived from fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, keeping reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today many Sami work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sami country.
Even if it's commonly used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments that are not your own, however their advice is intended for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East might be faced with different situations than those of Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is the generic term for any kind of meteorological phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or the loss of human lives.
Inclement weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different kinds that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of inclement weather, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal violent meteorological phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all severe weather risks that may affect their area since it can affect all their travel plans.
Those who plan to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment courses" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course should normally cover all the subjects discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last between 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid elements, and sometimes weapons training.

Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender not indicated (X) or to update documents to correspond to a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor those documents is simply variable everywhere.

Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backflow of waves that detach from the beach, often towards a reef or something nearby.
Due to the underwater topography, the rip current is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a rapid current towards the deep waters can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim to shore against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, getting back to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you will not be trapped again or, depending on your abilities and if you have been noticed, you may want to wait for help.
The reverse culture shock comes faster than the cultural shock (there is less than a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to their new culture sometimes experience particularly difficult moments when readapting to their culture of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need time to adapt.
It is possible that people do not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the beginning of the show.
Usually you constantly hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sounds and lights is simply like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, and then reemerge to form the ridge of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892 m of Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need data and voices.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those considering taking a sabbatical year is to travel to learn.
It is something particularly popular for those who leave school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in studies abroad during a gap year can actually improve your chances of entering higher education once you return to your home country.
There will generally be tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and the lakes, you don’t necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed big enough for all sorts of yachts, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This coincides with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but on the other hand, it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic Cruises include a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you go ashore only within the framework of the ship's excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, in Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something that we need to be ashamed of: it is not different from the fears and personal aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not being able to control anything.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the largest companies have their own planes, but for other routes and the smaller firms, there was a problem.
If they had sent the items by air freight, on some routes, it is possible that it would have taken days to go through the unloading stages and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as luggage in the hold. The airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to shell out a good amount of money for this privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
Nevertheless, it is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to at least four times the normal price in economy class for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business class seats or first class on direct flights from point A to B.
The airlines know well that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language there is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the UN member countries.
Economic links have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Before the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial hub, situated around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades, and the modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and the ancient mosques and churches, even if the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.

In the north, you should also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), a site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting primarily a site of mass graves and also a site of almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or who worked there until their deaths, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make any jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the site by writing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.

Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages that include Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, discourteous, and arrogant.
Even if it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to show your best behavior, by acting like someone who is "well-raised" (well-mannered). This will make getting along considerably easier.
The abrupt exteriors of the Parisians will quickly evaporate if you show some basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
To a notably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and variable altitude levels.

When visiting monasteries, women are asked to wear skirts that cover the knees and to have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
In the same vein, men were asked to wear trousers that covered the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the reserve at the entrance, but that suit is not washed after each user, and therefore you may feel uncomfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (generally pork), and uses olive oil throughout.

However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Given that light pollution at its peak was not the type of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those that were built during the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing the blooming of cherry trees, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the blooming of plum trees was the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have a better appearance when they are in a natural environment, so you must resist the temptation to pick just "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, picking some "specimens" will also get you expelled, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to go and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything as soon as you arrive.
But as it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the continuous heat and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, though more rarely).

Many of the traditions surrounding the holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at some exposed point to see the sun rise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often celebrate an Easter vigil on the night of Saturday during the Easter weekend, with congregations frequently starting the celebration at the first stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands got there either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, the mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
Given that the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
