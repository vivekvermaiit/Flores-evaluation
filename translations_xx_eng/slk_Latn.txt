Not only does it confirm the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, but it also provides details that fossils generally could not, among them color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists claim that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top, and pale or carotenoid-colored underneath.
The finding also provides a detailed insight into the development of birds' feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called rachis, but have other feather features – barbs and rays – scientists concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. According to scientists, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not the down of a juvenile.

The phenomenon that the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attractive force on Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way influence the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that the interaction of one dark matter with another dark matter is the same as it is with ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo around the galaxy and is made up of a multitude of small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as in the case of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the astrogeological team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), also operating at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech. Voters would go into a separate space and place a pre-printed sheet of paper with their candidate's name into an envelope.
Once officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law has a relatively strict codification of proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those cast by duly verified and counted voters.
Candidates may appoint representatives to witness the entire process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision in accordance with special procedures.

In her second race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place winner, Austria's Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place finisher, Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani.
Four seated female skiers in the women's group failed to finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not place in the race.
The police from Madhya Pradesh managed to recover the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
D. K. Arya, Deputy Inspector General, said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped a Swiss citizen and obtained her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house at the moment of the car crash, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
While the emergency service freed the driver from the red Audi TT, the road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Then Adekoya was charged by the Edinburgh sheriff's court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be compromised because her likeness was published on a large scale.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee claims that "journalists are heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photographs of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, indicated to journalists that they will not comment further on the case at least until charges are brought.
According to leaked information, the document is said to concern the dispute over the delineation of borders which Palestine demands based on the state of the borders prior to the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics that are reportedly being discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, as well as the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, after signing the agreement, demands a constant military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while Palestine agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary test against pests were to be under the strict supervision of foresters, because the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been accepted as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting park director for protection and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
In the last four years, this is Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the pre-agreed resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the extensive protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been taking place since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and resulted in four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the facilities.
Last week, the government agency METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (on Friday at 21:19 Greenwich Mean Time).
The Office for Emergency Situations in the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage was reported in the country.
According to the statement from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there is no indication that a tsunami wave should come.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were saved, and so far, at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Along with the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and elderly people, were also released early.
Then photographers took the place of an older lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm birth in his free time.
His research showed that administering the hormone would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, known as "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Comrades also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. She was my first manager. She died on the night of two moons, which was quite original, just like her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented on it by saying, "Luna was just as crazy as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's doing well up there."
Of the 1,400 people who participated in the survey before the federal elections in 2010, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the campaign before the 2010 federal election, expressed her belief that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of respondents share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games and was also supposed to swim in three relays, but due to his complaints, doubts about his fitness arose.
He couldn't take the medication needed to overcome the pain because it is banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the invention by early February using different hardware and software, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could likely have been a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic substances that can create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriages.
He described the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is expected that he will run for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of liters of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, enabling air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No other form of transport is available, overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are also no parking lots or park-and-ride facilities available.
Concerns about a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would need to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new species of birds on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new animal species managed to evolve within just two generations, even though it was believed that this process would take a much longer time. This was achieved through the hybridization of the endemic Darwin's finch Geospiza fortis and the immigrant cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a variety of shapes. For example, it can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and rolled into sheets.
It is possible to produce it very thin and it can be applied to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-made illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then use clean, wet hands to form a ball from them.
The moisture of your hands will start to react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange sensation and the formation of a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house.
Remnants of the sewage system were found in the homes of the Greek Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were together in mixed company.
You use a satellite to talk to someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
A satellite located in space receives a call, which it then almost immediately reflects back down to Earth.
The satellite was carried into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
To get a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a huge rocket, taller than 30 meters.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most significant thing that the wheel has brought us is much simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to that, we have trains, automobiles, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that prey on medium-sized game – from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a so-called niche, that is, specific areas or tasks that each of the predators is responsible for, which prevents mutual competition.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely connected to each other, as they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, which surprisingly resemble lions in behavior (but not other felines). They are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger, like a well-trained athlete, can climb (albeit not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times stronger than a powerful human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar with a powerful voice, but more like a couple of hoarse shouted words.
Ocelots enjoy eating small animals. Occasionally, they manage to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds. However, the vast majority of animals that ocelots hunt are significantly smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and seek out animals that can be eaten (prey) based on their scent and by sniffing areas where they have been.
They see very well in the dark using night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (for example, when they move across a mountain range, or a river, or when they move to a new island, making return difficult), they often find themselves in an environment that differs from the original one.
This new environment has various resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was needed before.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to resemble the members of other populations less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
The name of this process is speciation, which simply means the development of new species. Speciation is an unconditional result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale and take in carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants produce food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes, as well as to produce clothing. Most of what we consume has a plant origin. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were fitted with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. It also fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might have even been cannibalistic.
It also attacked everything that went into the water. Not even a huge dinosaur, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, would match it.
While many of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual foods at feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, while rich men preferred communal feasts where they consumed food while lounging on their sides.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly could not contain ingredients that only arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
People used to bring offerings to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, temples also included specially built pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
The house was not as significant in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of their lives, an ordinary Hebrew family spent under the open sky.
Women cooked in the yard, and shops consisted only of counters open towards the street. Stone was used for building the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found a new land and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are "Scandinavian" countries, there are many differences among their people, kings, customs, and history.
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text is located at the bottom of the document upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days it was a large parchment document (measuring 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the record only served to mark the document.
The landing in Normandy and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
The "Vichy" French ruled there. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was referred to as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and this word is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this in a certain way also defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture brings with it the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the continuation of cultural legacy, and even expansion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government according to the Articles of Confederation, which had Congress as its only component.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes. And since there was no national executive power or judiciary, the Congress relied on state authorities to enforce all its laws. However, they often did not cooperate.
It also had no authority to rewrite laws on taxes and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states held the central government in such low regard that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the national football team from Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, Italians compete in international events and Olympic events.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the clustering/grouping of islands that Japan has, from a geographical perspective, Japan is often considered an "archipelago."
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing around recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, began transforming the practices of growing indigenous grains, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) gained control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1975, and restoration continues to the present day.
For example, the most common format for photographs worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size during the decline of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensors of digital cameras.
In reality, the 35 mm format surprisingly has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The ratio of the sides of this format, which is divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio, is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many standard formats (for example, the group of APS formats) are equal to or closely approach this aspect ratio.
The simple rule of thirds, which is frequently used yet mocked, creates dynamics while also maintaining a degree of orderliness in the image.
He claims that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a millennium, Christianity united European countries despite differences in languages and customs.
His ubiquitous power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources should serve precisely these purposes.
The Church has been present as a central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether its principles were being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective as it managed to disrupt crucial military and civilian supplies. This was despite the blockade violating generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, which created a danger even for neutral ships.
As there was only a minimal reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
When the world saw the horrors and atrocities committed during the First World War, nations longed to avoid the repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to start working at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter from his manager at his previous job, Charles Batchelor, who recommended him to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China knew a unique way of depicting different time periods; each historical period or each ruling family in China was a dynasty that made a significant mark in history.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which existed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war was taking place among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, and thousands of people died in the battles for the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many noticeable social and political phenomena, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, jobs were available for all male applicants, thus allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the army because instead of basing military ranks on class, they have transitioned to using caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolution.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond earthly life. He often went to meditate in the cave known as Hira, on the mountain Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Lying on the top of one of the hills in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not easy at all to get into it, even if one knows where it is located. Once you find yourself in the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and a multitude of surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of all the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many extensive pyramid structures constructed in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also referred to as the "Giza Necropolis," is located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead. Here, one can see several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like a V, and the "down bow" symbol like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means that you should start from the tip and press down on the bow, while down means that you should start from the frog (the place where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
The upper part of the bow usually creates a softer sound, while the lower part of the bow is firmer and more durable.
You can feel free to write your own markings, but remember that the printed notes are there for musical reasons, so you should usually keep them.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, from Versailles back to Paris.
Back to Paris, they traveled in a carriage, accompanied by an angry crowd of shouting people who were threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of the royal guard, who had been beheaded at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of war incurred by American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to cover the majority of expenses and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government, directed through banking houses on Wall Street.
It is obvious that the enormous profits obtained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the fundamental income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must grasp the context in which the order was established.
The period during which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which generally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of concepts from the development of new technologies or the technological imperative to its narrow meaning that human destiny is guided by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology "influences" societies in ways that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, which is why new methods of production are being developed with the aim of reducing the costs associated with car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the recovery of injured bodies.
An important element of Romanticism was cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to geography emerged, which were in harmony with society and were better than arbitrarily set laws.
Just as Paris is currently considered the fashion capital, during the era of feudal Europe, it was Constantinople.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began sometime around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1,100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century. The main reason for this is that the Crusaders returned and brought gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to slow communication channels, however, styles in the west could lag by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. Among the greatest achievements of that time, brought by the Crusades, are buttons. They started to be used for fastening clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is conducted with the purpose of producing an amount of food that is necessary solely for the sustenance of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses its own saved seeds – originating from the ecoregion – in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, social class, geographic location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization draws from several unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unfortunate, or intentionally abused and were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "untamed" or wild. Some untamed children were restrained by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents abandoned the child because they could not cope with its severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others were reportedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a feral child is raised only by animals other than human beings, its behavior (within physical limits) is almost the same as the behavior of a particular animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should facilitate learning and make it more interesting, the strategy called "scaffolding" takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that helps people who encounter new experiences while learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
"Scaffolding" can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is also a form of "scaffolding," but so is the small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software. It is designed primarily to challenge and explain overly complex processes to the student that they would not be able to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet it still happens.
We perceive it as the foster care system representing a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is meant to provide children with all the necessary things that were lacking in the household from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional possibilities in the case of the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, there is an assumption that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivators for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
In researching audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as motivating aspects.
The use of video recording has led to significant revelations in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements, which only last a few milliseconds.
More precisely, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting micro-expressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
In his work The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks demonstrated that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can accurately judge the sincerity of a speech.
It even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior might also be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variations and selection removes them from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between these two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its need to obtain amino acids from available plant sources.
If you do not do so, it will have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources were probably the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a large amount of protein that contains all essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during the usual sleep time and then falling back asleep shortly afterward (10–60 minutes).
You can achieve this easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
However, if you repeatedly hit snooze on your alarm in your sleep, you might place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), which forces a person to get up and urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person has is indirectly related to the tension in the body and the spirit of the person.
The less tension, the more positive life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is essentially very simple and involves Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yogic postures, aerobic exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in the Second World War, which led to collaboration between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, these allied countries diverged in opinion precisely because of the clash of systems, processes, and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last another 40 years, and it was really fought through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive wall had already been broken, and its only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost overnight obsolete when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army violated the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, and entered the eastern regions of Poland, thus creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian front.
Using ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of naval forces was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move people and goods. At the same time, they were to prevent your enemy from moving people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to move troops and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
And at the same time, the German navy tried to stop these transfers mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and they were often tended by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the generally known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the draft horses to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the roads of that time, which were somewhat rougher.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was later found that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top.
It became a common practice, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of transport is walking. People began walking upright two million years ago, when Homo Erectus (upright man) evolved.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not commonly walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in australopithecine fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start behaving more considerately towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to some extent to reduce suffering in the future.
As in many cases, it is something like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should get to the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to human scientific and technological progress, and overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people only exacerbate the problems.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During one night, 150 to 200 copies were made. They are currently known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was delivered by John Nixon and took place on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
25 Dunlap's side pages still exist and are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original copy of the manuscript has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today hold the view that one group of dinosaurs survived and currently exists. We call them birds.
Many people do not perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds, there are many things that still look like those of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to in computer jargon as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are too general to allow an immediate diagnosis.
The quickest sign to determine that it's a case of internal poisoning is the presence of an opened package of medications or toxic household cleaning chemicals.
Look for the instructions on the label regarding first aid for this particular poisoning.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in the formal sense of the word.
This name comes from the old knowledge of the bed bug, which is an insect highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in a nest or stationed on their host.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 recorded cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the leading neurological diseases among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which comprises the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that the likelihood of developing MS in women is twice as high compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples can decide to create a so-called adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take over the care of the child.
The main goal of science is to use scientific methods to determine how the world works. In reality, these methods drive the majority of scientific research.
However, it's not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and insights during observation can also help direct scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific knowledge, including that in the field of psychology, was accepted.
The West gradually found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as knowledge of the Greek language declined.
Many observed physiological rhythms and behavioral rhythms often critically depend on the presence of internal cycles and their formation through biological clocks.
Most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have documented regular rhythms that are not merely responses to external repetitive signals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue in a free-running cycle even in the absence of stimuli from the external environment.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was among the main indications that DNA is the genetic material.
To implant their DNA into a bacterium, Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments tagging either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on their type, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the germ cells are influenced.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example includes tours, photography, and observing orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns for work and pass by others who are coming in to work from the places those first people just left.
In this shuttle transport, everyone is somehow tied to the car-based transportation system and supports it.
Science now suggests that this massive "carbon" economy has disrupted the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in life in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate a large number of complaints, why do they fail daily? Are only traffic engineers incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the result of observing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and monitoring their mutual interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is challenging because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave relatively consistently, and therefore traffic flows, which can be approximately mathematically represented, also often behave consistently.
For a clearer representation of the traffic flow, relationships between these three main characteristics were defined: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, designing, and operation of road infrastructures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
It offers them a greater selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Currently, there is only one type of insect that cannot fold its wings, and those are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in places it is up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It accumulates water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom. However, the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed, either in size or in the technical perfection of the construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world with the lowest number of inhabitants.
Italian is used in official communication and legal regulations in the Vatican.
Italian is also used daily by the majority who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because all of them can be found in their natural form in nature and can be fairly easily mined using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle came up with the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. Nevertheless, he believed that they change into new substances to create what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
When the pencil was introduced, it became a good friend to many people.
However, when newer writing methods appeared, the pencil was pushed to the sidelines and used less and less.
People nowadays leave messages on computer screens and never have to come close to a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb utilizes the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
Something similar to rolling a heavy cart uphill. When the core is split again, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei. This means that they are prone to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Under the grassland it is thinner and under the highland it is thicker.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. Lava reached the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people to behave in certain ways or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become intrinsic to them in adulthood.
These theories focus on what motivates people to want to do certain things and what in their environment compels them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, it is true that two types of behavior can occur when managers start leading their former peers. On one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain "one of the group" (or friends).
This type of manager has a problem making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, determining responsibility, and being accountable to people.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual with the feeling that they must change everything the team has done and do it their own way.
Ultimately, the manager is responsible for the success or failure of the entire team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual and traditional teams adhere to the same quality standards, albeit with minor differences.
Members of the virtual team mostly serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can meet according to changing time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique part of the virtual team is also the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The 'Invisible Team' is a managing team to which each member is subordinate. The Invisible Team also sets the conditions for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the objectives of implementing organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are utilized efficiently across the organization's executive departments, doors to creativity and ingenuity are opened.
The process of collaboration within the organization to overcome an obstacle can subsequently lead to a new innovative process that helps meet customer needs.
An organization can be innovative, but first the leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
The film Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations focus on achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research. They thus narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a large amount of information and material, enabling us to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
AI has a strong connotation of science fiction and constitutes a significant branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of robots.
Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Cases include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to life's problems.
Artificial intelligence is often used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been integrated into several applications in home computers and software applications in video games.
An important part of every class's life is excursions. The teacher often wants to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom with their classmates.
An excellent way to think about the trip and share experiences with other classes is to share the excursion in a virtual way.
Every year, for example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. Annually, the website is redesigned, but the older versions are kept online to serve as a journal.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog author strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
When blogging, "students are forced to focus more on the world around them." The need to satisfy audience interest thus inspires students to become more skilled and pursue their interests (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "will enable students to deepen their analytical and critical thinking; through active responses to online materials, students can define their attitudes in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming "bilingual" capital of Canada, offering visitors numerous art galleries and museums that showcase its past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north lie the untouched natural beauties of the Muskoka region.
All these and other things highlight Ontario as what is considered fundamentally Canadian by foreigners.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, with some parts being nearly uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of populations that will surprise many: More African Americans live in the USA than Canadians in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is itself a continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent countries or have ties with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it was embraced in grand style in the Comoros and on the island of Mayotte.
The period of European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west, it is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travelers are advised to claim that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also useful (but only one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would normally consider harassment. It is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the shoulder, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and served as a strategic port under the name Anfa for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dár al-Bajdá, and Spanish merchants, who established trading bases in the city, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan products are sold, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of knickknacks, but all of this is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, you should conduct research before trips outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting situation in the Nord-Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
To travel around the city of Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor to denote relatively inaccessible, exotic, and distant countries.
Timbuktu is currently an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction. There is also an airport there.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates during the special PBS program "Wonders of the African World."
The city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the country because its appearance is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) in the northeast of South Africa stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Here, too, a fee is charged for daily park maintenance and entrance fees, just as it is in all South African national parks.
The most advantageous option may be to purchase a Wild Card ticket, which allows entry either into a selected number of parks in South Africa or into all South African national parks.
The whole region of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and it is a place that is the main focal point of interest for many tourists.
The group of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong could be likened to a glowing bar chart visible from Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the most beautiful view of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head across to the Kowloon coast.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonizers appropriated, and if you’re looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past, it’s a good idea to start at this place.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarban was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. Part of the forest on Indian territory is designated as Sundarban National Park.
Forests do not only include mangrove swamps — they also include some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², with about one third consisting of water/marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife kingdom, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is recommended to purchase a ticket several days in advance because intercity buses are often full.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby towns such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It goes over the entire Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was put into operation only in March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is scheduled to start in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints should already be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group of the population. They settled in the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "The Giant Province of the Indias," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in the Las Cañitas area.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also organized here at other times of the year.
You can find information about tournaments and ticket purchase options for polo matches on the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency in the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is set as equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and through Stanley's credit cards, and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although both British and American currency might be taken; check with the owners in advance to find out what the acceptable payment procedure is.
Exchanging Falkland currency outside the islands is almost impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the entire year.
Despite many animals in the park being accustomed to the presence of people, wildlife remains wild and we should not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, you should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they appear, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not maintain a sufficient distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they should be given space.
It should also be noted that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital city of the state of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of the state of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval misunderstanding in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships, except for one British cruiser, were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering of people in the town led to the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The boundaries by two harbors in Auckland allow the existence of many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches in North Shore (in North Harbor District) are located by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and on most of them, pohutukawa trees provide shade.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded beaches for families with plenty of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One, it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called Manta.
Many French wines can be procured, on the other hand, New Zealand and Australian wines could be more available.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink. However, if you have concerns, obtaining bottled water is not a problem.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A small black coffee is an "espresso," cappuccino is served with a thick layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the cliff take place throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the cliff are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the relevant authorities, heed the signs, and pay increased attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. They occasionally occur outside of this period as well.
Sharks really do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean; their typical habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that upon arrival at their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with specific hotels. However, they also offer the option to book other types of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need more time to consider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
Any suggestions for changes or requests should be directed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the overwhelming majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there earlier to secure a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music performance ends on the main stages, in some parts of the festival, music may play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are passing through the northern Baltics during the winter period, check the location of the cabin, because walking on the ice causes quite a terrible noise to those who are most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include a stay in the city. Passengers on a round trip cruise are exempt from visa requirements (however, please check the conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to ensure that guests spend as much time as possible and as much money as possible. They generally lack windows or clocks, and exits can be found only with difficulty.
They usually have unique offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and staying as long as possible.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered. Since drunkenness impairs judgment, all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the likelihood of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and therefore you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short amount of time that you could get stuck in it.
Reduced visibility can be caused by falling or blowing snow, condensation of water on the window, or also ice forming on the vehicle's window.
In contrast, in many countries ice and snow are common, and traffic continues almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest attraction for tourism in Africa and a great experience for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to land travel with the purpose of viewing the magnificent African wilderness, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are better seen from afar using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk or hiking safari or just walking) is a several-hour or several-day hike.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, where the games were held in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you might have found yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most cancellation policies originating from the coronavirus do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It can be expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with the price of a regular ticket being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps to dry damp clothes. Even if they are not in the room, many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for borrowing.
If an iron is not available or if you don't like ironing socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it can cause it to shrink, in extreme cases even burn).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for just one minute, elsewhere it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may come into contact with animal pests that are not found in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or violently kill people are usually not classified as pests.
Shopping in so-called duty-free zones allows for the purchase of goods exempt from ordinary and excise taxes.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a substantial amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the stretch with the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: they are full of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections—typically 56-64 km/h—and adhering to them strictly is more important than ever before.
Surprisingly, the mobile phone service here is much stronger than in many other sections of the route, e.g., in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are also fairly varied and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common. Apples tend to be baked into pastries year-round, while sour cherries and plums typically appear in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Often, popular cakes are mainly combined with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the filled doughnut, which is called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
We know "dry" or "wet" curry depending on the amount of liquid used.
In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
If this term is used without further qualifications, it tends to mean food originally originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widely available throughout the archipelago, includes a number of simply flavored dishes. Among the predominant condiments favored by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can also pose a safety risk as the rider's feet could potentially get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Most riders wear riding boots with heels and fairly narrow smooth soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety bars that allow the stirrup to release from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backward.
Cochamó Valley is a popular climbing destination in Chile. Due to its diverse enormous granite walls and overhangs, it is referred to as the Yosemite of South America.
The views from the mountain peaks are breathtaking. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly discovering new routes among the endless potential of the walls.
Popular winter downhill sports like skiing and snowboarding consist of sliding down snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main travel activity, which has many enthusiasts, occasionally also known as "skiing fanatics," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a given location.
The idea of skiing is very old — cave paintings depicting skiers date back to as early as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
With a backpack on skis: This activity is also called cross-country skiing with a backpack, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
It is related (but usually does not include) to alpine ski tours and mountaineering, which are practiced in steep terrain and require much harder skis and footwear.
Consider the ski trail similar to a tourist trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than if you were walking – but you will very rarely reach the speed you would achieve cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean that you have to repeatedly apply for visas and go through passport controls.
In this regard, the Schengen Area functions to some extent as a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without passing through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the member countries of the Schengen area separately, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The conditions for establishment vary across the world, and this age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be classified as antiques despite being younger than a similar mass-produced product.
Reindeer herding represents an important means of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture in the field of trade is also important for many other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sámi people were extensively involved in reindeer herding, but they also engaged in fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi engage in modern crafts. In Sápmi, the Sámi region, tourism is an important source of income.
Even though the word "cigán" is very widespread, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are planning to visit is subject to travel advisories, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
Apart from your own government, you might also want to consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The informational news provides only a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The mentioned opinions are often only superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, lead to serious social disruptions, or result in loss of human life.
Adverse weather and its various types, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions, can occur anywhere in the world.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and fires are forms and effects of adverse weather such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.

We strongly advise travelers to consider all the risks that may arise due to adverse weather conditions in their area, which could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered to be a war zone should attend professional training.
Simply search the internet for "hostile environment course" and you will likely get the address of some local company.
The course covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, along with practical experiences.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid instructions, and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in nature are common, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Passengers who are planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents with them for the return journey as well.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
Similarly diverse is the willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents.
In the period after September 11, 2001, controls at security checkpoints also became much more annoying.
Transgender people should not expect to pass through scanners without interference with privacy and dignity before surgery.
Rip currents are the backflow from waves breaking on the beach, often near a cliff or similar.
Thanks to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in several deeper sections, where a rapid current or even deep water can form.
The majority of fatalities are due to exhaustion when attempting to swim back against the current, which can be completely impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether someone has noticed you, you can try to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock sets in faster than cultural shock (the initial honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who easily adapted to a new culture, it is sometimes particularly challenging to readjust to their original culture.
After returning home from a stay abroad, you adapted to a new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt in a new country.
People do not have to anticipate that travelers returning home need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in this area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the beginning of the performance.
You usually always hear the chatter of tourists and vendors here. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is displayed as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Various scenes are depicted on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, which have the most bases, with sixteen still active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
These include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano still creates a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area located on the southern part of the peninsula and is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into a plateau and then reemerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountain range, which is intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range lie the highest mountains of Antarctica. It is the Vinson Massif with the highest peak, Mount Vinson, which reaches a height of 4,892 meters above sea level.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone coverage.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone. To make a call with it, you must be outdoors in a location with a clear view of the satellite.
This service is often used in maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as on expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a free year off, a so-called gap year, traveling and learning is becoming an increasingly popular choice.
It is particularly popular among recent graduates, as it offers them the possibility of a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, participating in a foreign bridging course can truly increase your chances of gaining admission to college-level studies in your country.
Usually, it is necessary to pay tuition to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Rowing is Finland's national sport, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is the same for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, the number is 1 in forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea also offer an extended stay in Russian St. Petersburg.
It means that you have a couple of full days to visit the historic town, while at night you return to the ship.
If you go ashore only for an excursion on a cruise ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures include the German city of Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience, regardless of the age or background of the travelers. This is especially true if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having things under control.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast delivery. When it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repair, time is often very important.
On some routes, larger companies have their own airplanes, but on other routes and with smaller companies, a problem has arisen.
In the case that the items were sent by air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take days on some transportation routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked luggage. However, airline regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to allocate a large amount of funds for this privilege (or ideally, to get your company to do so on your behalf).
However, it will not be cheap: you can expect to pay an estimated four times the regular fare for business class and up to eleven times for first class!
In general, it's not worth even looking for discounts on business class or first-class tickets for direct flights from point A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is used very often.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member country of the UN.
Economic relations have been renewed between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna has transformed into a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center that spreads around an enormous bay and is surrounded by mountains.
Amidst the wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers, there are houses with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches. The city feels more like the atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than contemporary Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble statues of doves over some tombs.
It is worth taking a half-hour walk around an interesting village.
Within reach to the north is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which is famous among foreigners and was made famous by a brilliant poem about its wonders, written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, it is possible to visit the significant shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (tomb), which is the site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please keep in mind that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and also a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who spent some time of their lives there, and many more whose loved ones were murdered or worked to death there, both of Jewish and non-Jewish origin.
Approach the page with the utmost dignity, with all the seriousness and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the site by writing or scratching graffiti into the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the population prefers to communicate in Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs and markers are only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
Spanish is still commonly used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant people.
Although it is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way not to get lost in Paris is to always behave as best as you can and to present yourself as someone "bien élevé" (well-mannered). Not getting lost will be significantly easier.
The stern exterior of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely covered with forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide range of plant communities thanks to its range of microclimates, varying soils, and different altitudes.
This area is also home to a variety of animal and bird species.
There is a rare fauna here, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one that has bright colors, a monk or nun may smile at you upon entry.
According to the same regulations, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can also borrow such clothing from the storehouse at the entrance, but you need to be aware that the clothing is not washed after each user, so you probably won't feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like others in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (primarily pork) and does not go without olive oil.
A simple favorite dinner, especially during summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, or other toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns and the personal pronoun Sie (You) always start with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between verbs and objects.
It also demonstrably helps to simplify reading, but writing is somewhat more complicated due to the need to distinguish whether the verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is quite simple because most words are pronounced the same way as they are written.
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.

Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this foundation of grammar could help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It is true that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and remain used as museums or places meant for education.
They are usually found in cities or campuses because they were built in their heyday, when light pollution was not yet an issue. It's easier to get to them than to those that were built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large installations located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized only for the emperor and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even a single specimen.
If you visit a meticulously maintained garden, taking "samples" will also undoubtedly ensure your expulsion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place and is very easy to navigate. On arrival, you can buy almost anything there.
However, if you are in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and also the strong sun (in clear skies, less frequently).
To the north to Hebron, which is the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives, several buses also run.
Make sure that the bus you are considering goes to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for choosing a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat trip on the Erie Canal.
Besides that, you will also find popular tourist and cycling routes in their vicinity.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions related to the holiday have been adopted by non-believers and non-Christians throughout the world, even in Christian countries.
According to tradition, you spend Easter under the open sky so that you can watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it might as well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the gatherings often celebrated at the stroke of midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either swam, flew, or floated here.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to make this journey. As a result, the giant tortoise became a primarily grazing animal in the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced to the area, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It will be a good opportunity to observe the aurora borealis because the sky will be dark almost continuously.
And you will be able to enjoy the stars, too, because light pollution is not a problem in sparsely populated areas.
Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what people in the West are accustomed to.
Suits are common work attire and colleagues address each other by surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key, with emphasis placed on group effort rather than individual achievements being praised.
Employees often must obtain approval from their superiors before making any decisions, and they are expected to follow their instructions unconditionally.
