Although one trial vaccine is supposed to reduce mortality from Ebola, no drug has yet been clearly proven to be suitable for treating an existing infection.
One of the antibody cocktails, ZMapp, initially seemed promising in this area, but formal studies have shown that it offers less benefit in preventing death than desired.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control drug, which means it was used as a baseline and the other three drugs were compared to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and agrees with the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the United States Olympic Committee that the interests of our athletes, clubs, and their sports will be better represented if we proceed with significant changes within the organization rather than with the withdrawal of certification.

This confirms the already established theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers and also provides data that fossils typically cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on the upper side and pastel or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
The discovery also offers insight into the development of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, which we call a rachis, but they do have all the other characteristics of feathers — barbs and hooks — researchers have determined that the rachis very likely developed later in evolution than the other characteristics.
From the structure of the feathers, it can be inferred that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers believe the specimen shows that it is the feathers of an adult specimen and not the down of a baby.
Although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers believe that the specimen shows adult feathers rather than juvenile down.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate the observation of the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect that the team wanted to achieve would be caused by tidal forces between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way with its force also influences the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in a way similar to ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is supposed to be concentrated around it in the form of a ring composed of numerous small particles.

In France, elections have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and insert a pre-printed piece of paper with their marked choice into an envelope.
When the officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
French electoral law quite strictly defines this procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes have been added, except for those submitted by duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

First, she competed in the slalom where she earned the label Did Not Finish after the first run. In this race, the same result was achieved by 36 out of 116 competitors.
In her second race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a total time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the women's sitting group did not finish their runs, and out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom, 45 did not qualify for the competition.
Police in Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are said to be Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Senior Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendants came to court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when a car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed so that emergency services could free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Later, the Edinburgh sheriff court charged Adekoyo with the murder of his son.
In custody, she is awaiting an indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimonies may be unreliable since her picture was published everywhere.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and the court has ruled that publishing the photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists are on thin ice when they publish photographs of suspects and the like."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is fully responsible for legal prosecution, indicated to reporters that it would not provide further comments at least until the indictment.
They revealed that the document will pertain to a dispute regarding the borders that Palestine wishes to establish based on the pre-war borders from the Middle East conflict in 1967.
Other topics to be discussed are expected to include the future status of Jerusalem, considered sacred by both states, and the issues concerning the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, whereas the Palestinian Authority has only agreed to such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the attempt for additional pest control were under the scrutiny of the guards, as the test is monitored and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc, qualified volunteers are recruited under the auspices of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the executive director for park conservation and heritage services at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety instructions and training guidelines.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed the preliminary resignation of the Interim Election Council as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, which are occasionally also violent, were triggered by failed elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of non-functioning iPods were reported, which caused six fires and minor burns to four individuals.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that they were aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company labeled as "non-hazardous."
The response from the ministry was that Apple's postponement of the report is "truly regrettable."
Mariano experienced an earthquake at 07:19 local time (on Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Office of Crisis Management of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage was recorded in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been rescued and so far at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers replaced an elderly lady who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical path.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research shows that the addition of the hormone in a child accelerates fetal lung development.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two "black boxes" of the aircraft on Wednesday.
The wrestlers' colleagues also paid tribute to Luni.
"Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Just as unique as she was herself. A strong woman," said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels remarked, "Luna was just as bizarre as I am ... maybe even more ... I love her and will miss her ... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 respondents surveyed before the federal elections in 2010, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
During the federal election campaign in 2010, the interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, argued that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of participants in the survey agree with the demand that Queen Elizabeth II be the last ruler of Australia.
On one hand, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while on the other hand, 31 percent of respondents think that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The gold Olympic medalist was supposed to swim the 100 and 200 m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questionable due to his problems.
He was not allowed to take the medication he needed for pain relief, as they are prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
The discovery, which was published on Tuesday, was confirmed by several people by the beginning of February using various hardware and software.
Comets could represent a source that brought water and organic materials to Earth, from which proteins can form and which allow for life.
Scientists hope to determine how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, since it has been a long time since comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and supported a bill to legalize same-sex marriages last month.
He described the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is anticipated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the old stationary radar-based technology, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of the aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be offered, and overground trains will not stop in Wembley, parking and park-and-ride services are not available on the surface.
Due to fears of a lack of transport links, there is a possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from the American Princeton University and the Swedish Uppsala University have reported a new species that developed through the hybridization between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza fortis, in just two generations, although previously it was thought that this process takes much longer.
Gold can be formed into many different shapes. It can be rolled into fine shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can also be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be flattened very thinly and attached to other metals. Because it can be flattened so thinly, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, called "illuminated manuscripts."
We call this pH of chemicals. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of the chemical.
The pH value of the tested chemicals is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both powders and shape them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on the palms will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and the formation of a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of the sewage system have been found in houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would meet in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then almost instantly bounces it back down.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, a gigantic rocket, over 100 feet tall, is required.
The wheel has completely changed the world. One of its most notable contributions is faster and easier transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other forms of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are also many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that feed on much more numerous prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche concept, a special role that each cat has, which protects it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three related males, and up to thirty females and younglings.
Like a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely connected to one another.
A pride of lions behaves very similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in behavior (but not to other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete and can climb (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull five times stronger than a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four representatives of big cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as full and uniform as a lion's, but more abruptly growling and shrieking.
Ocelots feed on small animals. Whenever they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are considerably smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and search for animals for food (prey) by using their sense of smell, as they can smell where they have lingered on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well at night and move silently. Lynxes hunt by first blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it migrates across a mountain range or river, or relocates to a new island and it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it previously lived in.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will require different traits or adaptations to be able to compete with them.
The original population has not changed in any way; they still need the same adjustments as before.
When a new population starts to adapt to a new environment, it gradually becomes less and less similar to the other population.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, the populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans expel from their lungs (or exhale).
Plants produce food through photosynthesis with the help of the sun. They also provide shade.
We use plants to make our houses and clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw contained more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, and he also had additional teeth on the palate, so he destroyed anything that crossed his path.
We don't have exact data, but it is possible that it had a bifurcated tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and might even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked all the creatures that stepped into the water; not even the huge dinosaurs, like the tyrannosaurs, could match him.
Although their food would mostly seem familiar to us, the Romans did have quite a few strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on chairs while dining, the wealthy men preferred to enjoy their meals together, reclining on their sides as they ate.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, which was supposed to represent the home of the individual god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
In the past, they built special towers in the shape of pyramids called ziggurats, which were part of the temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
The life of the Hebrew family mostly took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were merely open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Nordic sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and discovered Greenland on his journey westward, naming it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, tribes of Eskimos had already lived there at that time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences among their people, kings, customs, and history.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" were written. The text is inscribed at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the great document on parchment (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was initially stored in the form of a scroll at the beginning of its lifetime.
Therefore, it is possible that the bookmark was simply added as a tag.
With the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, northern France was liberated, while the southern part remained unliberated.
He was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, Allied forces occupied southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
The Americans and the Free French forces liberated the south of France in just two weeks and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of individuals who live and cooperate together, a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin word civilis, which means civic and is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, indicating in a way the size of society.
City-states are precursors to nations. The culture of civilization includes the transmission of knowledge through generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and significant spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government with the Articles of Confederation – it was composed only of Congress.
The Congress did not have the power to enforce taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities to enforce its laws, who often did not want to cooperate.
Furthermore, he had no authority to annul tax laws and tariffs between countries.
To amend the articles, the consent of all federal states was required, but individual federal states did not take the central authority seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became the world football champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Due to the collection/group of islands that Japan has, from a geographical perspective, it is often called an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began transforming the indigenous methods of grain cultivation and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the military forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, the Qing Dynasty government, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thereby ceding control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to make it easier for tourists to imagine how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most widespread photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still used today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format actually – and somewhat unusually – measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to obtain the most basic ratio in integer form) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (ASP family of formats) are the same or very close to this height-to-width ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often exploited and frequently mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while also providing a measure for arranging the image.
According to it, the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown wealthy and expanded its power, came under scrutiny.
Christian faith connected European countries for more than a millennium despite differences in language and customs.
Her ubiquitous power influenced both kings and common people.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are intended precisely for this purpose.
The seat of the central authority of the church has been based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to doubt whether it truly follows this principle.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy used to disrupt the most important military and civilian supply proved effective, but this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which is codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire areas of the ocean, thereby also endangering neutral ships.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing positions of the majority of citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he took a job at the Edison company in New York.
When he arrived in the USA, he had with him only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous manager) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China depicted different time periods in a unique way; each stage of China or each ruling family was recognized as a distinct dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties, there was also an unstable period when the provinces were divided. Among these periods, the most well-known is the period of the Three Kingdoms between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted 60 years.
During these periods, fierce battles took place among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the grand palace of the city of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, for example, the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, and not to a single ruler.
Additionally, after the revolution, professions were open to all male seekers, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This also applies to the military, as military ranks are now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in things beyond this earthly life. He visited the cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) to contemplate.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very clear idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave, located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In essence, it is not easy to find, even if we know it exists. However, the interior of the cave offers complete solitude.
Except for the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. From inside the cave, little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza is still preserved today.
The Great Pyramid, which was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many larger pyramid structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza plateau, or in the "necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for "bow up" looks like the letter V, while "bow down" looks like a clip or a square without the bottom side.
Up means that you should start at the top of the bow and push it, down means that you should start at the frog (i.e., where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
The bow pull from above usually creates a softer sound, while the bow pull from below is stronger and more decisive.
If you wish, you can outline your bow marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed bow marks are indicated for musical reasons, so they should still be considered.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by an enraged crowd of market women to withdraw from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats at the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to throw open the carriage windows.
At one point, someone from the crowd waved the head of a royal guard member, killed in Versailles, in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover the majority of costs and interest for bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the staggering profits resulting from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would represent fundamental income for U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which the order was created.
The era during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, which marks a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological striving or technological necessity to the idea that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their embodiment in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the same general idea: that the development of technology follows a path strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently causes "effects" on societies that are more inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that with the development of cars, roads will certainly evolve as well.
It is not economically justifiable to build a national road network for just a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher occurrence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for treating injured bodies.
Cultural determinism, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was an important element of Romanticism.
In the case of romance, individuals were shaped by geographical affiliation, and over time customs and culture emerged associated with specific geographical areas, which were in harmony with the state of society and thus better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation, which marked it as a center of luxury, was established around the year 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status somewhat declined in the twelfth century because the crusaders returned home full of gifts in the form of silk and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
During this time, the title of the fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress in the east had a strong touch of Byzantine culture.
Due to slow communication links, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, in Western Europe, they began to develop their own style. One of the greatest advancements of that time and a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons for fastening clothes.
Subsistence farming is a term used for agriculture with the aim of producing a sufficient amount of food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system in which saved seeds originating from the same ecological region are used, combined with crop rotation or another simple technique to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can differ by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics by which a subculture is recognizable can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their affiliation through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to base it on some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their upbringing due to neglect, unfortunate circumstances, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wolf" or wild children. Some wolf children were confined by people (usually their parents); such forms of child abuse were in some cases the result of parents rejecting the child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
Before they were abandoned or ran away, wild children might have been subjected to severe abuse or trauma in childhood.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; for some, it is said that they lived in the wild themselves.
When feral children are completely raised by non-human animals, their behavior (within physical limitations) is almost entirely the same as that of the animal caretakers, for example, fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, drama takes it a step further.
Coaching is not a teaching method, but rather assistance that provides support to individuals who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stages can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of stage, but this also applies to the little clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stages are an integral part of the software and are meant to pose questions, encourage, and explain processes that might be too challenging for the student themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, loving, and nurturing, yet this happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the essential necessities of life that they did not have in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet allow for new dimensions in terms of usage and approach to rewarding.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are supposed to be significant motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also recognized as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied how audiences respond to websites.
Video recording has enabled significant discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
They say, in particular, that with the correct interpretation of micro-expressions, it should be possible to detect whether a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks explained that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nonetheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even assumes that such abilities to interpret human behavior are also possessed by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century shows that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
A mutation introduces a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination with each generation redistribute variations back and forth between two sets.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet the amino acid requirements with the plant sources available in the savanna.
Moreover, if this need cannot be met, it leads to serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would be the proteins present in leaves and legumes, which, however, are difficult for primates, including us, to digest if they are not cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also a source of high-quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is a process during which you intentionally wake up during your usual sleep time and go back to sleep shortly afterwards (after 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will stir you, but not wake you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up and go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace in an individual is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in the individual's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the presence of life force. Every person has the potential to achieve absolute peace and satisfaction.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only obstacle on the path to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it also considers the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is fundamentally very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga with yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations enables the awakening of kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment).
The central Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Because Germany was a common enemy during World War II, the USSR and the USA started to cooperate. After the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural differences led to a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and they really fought, with the help of proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was retreat and regrouping at the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans became obsolete practically overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army marched in and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after occupying the eastern Polish regions, which was in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of navies has been to ensure that the country retains the ability to move people and goods while at the same time restricting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. To help Britain, the Americans tried to bring men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy primarily wanted to stop this kind of traffic with U-boats.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in taking over Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started breeding them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat shepherds, who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep shepherds. These methods of herd management are still used today.
In England, tracks were already built in the 16th century.
Although the tracks for the wagons were made only of parallel planks, because of them the horses that pulled them could reach higher speeds and haul heavier loads than on the somewhat inferior roads of that time.
Quite soon they began to use sleepers to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, they realized that the tracks are more efficient if they have an iron strip on top.
This became a widespread practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels on the wagons to wear out more quickly.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first tracks, made entirely of iron, were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transport; people started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (or upright man).
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, usually did not walk upright.
The characteristics of bipedal walking are present in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, but the hominid Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
Our lives can become more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental protection movement, we can even become activists, in order to some extent reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed enormously due to the scientific and technological advancement of humanity, but problems have also been exacerbated by overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of humans.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night, they produced between 150 and 200 copies, known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
There are still 25 Dunlap broadsides considered the oldest surviving copies of this document, as the handwritten original has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
Birds still share many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, these two digits are called binary digits – or bits, if we use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always the most obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The main sign indicating internal poisoning is the possible presence of open packaging of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions specific to this poison.
Entomologists officially use the term insects for this group of insects.
This expression originates from a prehistoric kinship with mites, highly developed human parasites.
Both bedbugs and mites are nest-dwelling animals that are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young adults and adults in middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, specifically the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
The couple can decide that caring for the child is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can assume the role of the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works using the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
But that's not all; an important part of scientific research is also testing, where a test is designed to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and observing.
Naturalists and philosophers devoted themselves to classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
In all fields of science, including psychology, Aristotle's views were established.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the Western world cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The majority of observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often significantly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation through biological clocks.
Repetitive rhythms that are not merely responses to periodic external stimuli have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue periods of continuous cyclical repetitions even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main clues that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary greatly, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether germ cells are affected.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Field activities include, among others, hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Such an example is observing, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in cars to get to work, and they pass by those heading to work in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic mode of transport, everyone is somehow connected to the transportation system based on personal cars and also supports it.
Science now shows that the massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
In society, everyone participates and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, and why do they fail every day? Is it the incompetence of traffic engineers to blame? Or is it perhaps something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with one another.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100-percent certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is generally somewhat consistent, so traffic flows are also established and can roughly be represented in mathematical form.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These ratios help in the planning, design, and operation of roadways.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Due to their ability to fly, they could more skillfully avoid predators and more effectively search for food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them even more options to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings along their bodies are dragonflies and mayflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought that he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, as we do not feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and at the same time the largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon, with sections up to six miles wide, is also the widest river on Earth.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of pyramids with stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the pyramids in Giza and the technical expertise of their construction were never surpassed.
During the New Kingdom period, the Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has approximately 800 residents. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
In the Vatican, legislation and official communication are in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of workers in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, because all of them can be found in their native form in nature and can be fairly easily extracted with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
Essentially, there were more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he argued that they transform into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals here such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so very small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, upon its invention, the pencil became a dear friend to many.
Unfortunately, new writing methods have emerged, and the pencil has been pushed aside.
People now write messages on computer screens and don't even get close to a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works by using energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Some of this energy is then released by the fission of the nucleus again.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they usually disintegrate on their own or with almost no assistance.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
On the near side the crust is about 70 km thick, and on the far side 100 km.
It is thinner beneath the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. Lava could more easily rise to the surface.
Theories about content focus on finding what drives people forward or what pleases them.
These theories state that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow up.
These theories investigate what it is that makes certain people desire the things they desire, and which things in the environment will prompt them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivation theory.
When directors begin to lead their former colleagues, it is generally considered that they may start to behave in one of two ways. On one hand, there is an effort to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
Such a leader finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, enforce disciplinary measures, assess worker performance, assign tasks, and hold people accountable for mistakes made.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognizable individual who thinks they have to change everything the team was doing and chart the course in their own way.
Ultimately, the leader is primarily responsible for the success and failure of the group.
Such behavior often creates gaps between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual groups aspire to the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, yet there are small differences.
Virtual members of the group often act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They usually have more freedom than regular group members, as their groups need to adapt to multiple time zones, which their local leadership sometimes does not accommodate.
Another characteristic component of a virtual team is the presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
"The 'invisible team' is a management team to which individual members report. The invisible team sets standards for each member individually."
Why would an organization undergo the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? Among other things, the translation of organizational learning concepts into practice is aimed at innovation.
When the operating departments of an organization effectively utilize available resources, creativity and ingenuity can begin.
This way, in the process of cooperation within the organization with the aim of overcoming obstacles, a new innovative process can emerge that will meet the needs of clients.
Before a particular organization can become innovative, the leadership must establish an innovative environment and promote shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research. Therefore, they narrow down the field of research and significantly increase its accuracy.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the theses in scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain cognitive functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand how processes unfold in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation of science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computing that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
The mentioned things have become separate industries that focus on providing solutions for real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is embedded in numerous software programs for personal computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every lesson. Teachers would often gladly take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution by conducting virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire art right in the classroom.
Publishing the report about the excursion online is also an excellent way of reflecting on the trip and sharing the experience with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trip to the state capital, redesign the website every year, but the old versions remain online and serve as a memory album.
Blogs can help students improve their writing style. Although most students start a blog with superficial grammar and spelling, this typically changes with the presence of an audience.
Because students can often be the most demanding audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to engage the audience inspires students to want to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and students' efforts to learn, even when they are not in school.
Appropriate use of blogs "can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; by continuously responding to online material, students can establish their position in relation to the writings of others and develop their own views on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, boasting numerous art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Slightly to the south are the Niagara Falls, while to the north, we find the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka with its hinterland.
All this and much more puts the landscape of Ontario at the forefront as something that is considered typically Canadian among foreigners.
Extensive areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The comparison of populations seems surprising to many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and distinct continent if we consider its animal and plant world.
Smaller islands are mostly independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this territory, which became strongly established in the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
The beginning of European influence and colonization dates back to the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India around Africa.
The region in the north borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: we recommend that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (but not one that looks very valuable).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can create the impression of harassment, and it is not unusual for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Firmly reject the men and do not be afraid to defend your position (this is not acceptable, regardless of cultural differences).
Modern Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used it as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and then abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt as Daru l-Badya by the Moroccan sultan, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is not difficult to find places that sell traditional Moroccan delights such as tagine, pottery and leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of knick-knacks, but all of this is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is safe enough, trips outside Goma need to be researched to understand the conflicts ongoing in the North Kivu province.
This city is also a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and offers some of the most affordable opportunities for tracking mountain gorillas in Africa.
In Goma, you can travel by bodaboda (motorcycle taxi). For a short ride at the usual (local) price, you will pay about 500 Congolese francs.
Because it is also quite difficult to access, "Timbuktu" is used as another name for exotic, remote lands.
Although it is a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, Timbuktu is now an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops in the PBS television special by Henry Louis Gates, "Wonders of the African World."
This city is completely different from other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic touch than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different group of wildlife and plant life.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
A daily entrance fee must be paid for the conservation of nature and visiting the park, just like in any South African national park.
It might be a bad idea to buy Wild Card passes, which provide access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island and is a major destination for many tourists.
A series of buildings that make up the silhouette of the city of Hong Kong is connected with a shimmering tower bar graph, highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Urban development on the Hong Kong islands is largely concentrated in the reclaimed area on the northern coast.
The town was taken over by British colonists as their own, so it is a good starting point for exploring the remnants of the colonial past of this area if you are interested.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps—they include some of the last surviving remnants of the mighty jungles that once thrived across the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and it is estimated that today there are 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 chitals in the area.
Buses run from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, most of them, especially those heading east and to Dzongkhar/Bumthang, from 6:30 to 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts offer small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
With ride-sharing taxis, you can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby towns, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the town of Oiapoque in Brazil with the town of Saint Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters tall, measure 378 meters in length, and have two passages that are 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge stands 15 meters high. It was built in August 2011, but was only opened for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge was supposed to start operating in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints were expected to be completed as well.
The Guarani, who lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence farming, were the most important indigenous group residing in the territory of present-day eastern Paraguay.
In the Chaco region, there lived other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, sometimes also referred to as the "great Indian province," developed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous natives.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the city of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its own character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
You can watch smaller tournaments and matches throughout the year.
Tournament news and information on purchasing tickets for polo matches can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), and its value is set equivalent to the value of the British pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted on virtually all the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also mostly accepted.
The outer islands may not accept credit cards; however, they might accept British and American currency. Inquire in advance with the owners to find out which payment methods are acceptable.
The Falklands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange your cash before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in summer, temperatures often exceed +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but because of the mix of wind and humidity, it feels colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" periods: the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, wild animals are still wild, and therefore they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
Bison, Canadian elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, no matter how tame they might seem.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so leave them alone.
Furthermore, you need to know that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so do not carry or cook strongly scented food and maintain cleanliness in the campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the harbor was the scene of a notorious naval showdown when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggles for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful march in the town ended with the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland spans two harbors, there is a lot of coastline here. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches in North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie along the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are mostly sandy and safe for swimming, and are usually dotted with New Zealand Christmas pohutukawa trees, which provide shade.
The coastal stretch of Tamaki Drive is located at the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in the heart of Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that can sometimes get crowded, with a good selection of shops surrounding the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not complex, but a pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can indulge in various French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines will probably travel better.
The tap water there is safe to drink, but it's not difficult to find bottled water if you're afraid.
Australians perceive "coffee with milk" as something foreign. A short black coffee is an "espresso," cappuccino is served with a generous amount of cream (not frothed milk), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year, many hikers go to the ridge, but there are few injuries on the ridge that would occur due to any of these causes.
However, follow the authorities' instructions, respect all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps come close to the beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be observed outside this time frame.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean; their original habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, a traveler ensures that they will have a place to sleep upon reaching their chosen destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need to consider the offer or obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, all adjustments and requests must first be communicated to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it a key part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of the action, you need to get there early to secure a camping spot close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages may fall silent, it should be noted that at some festival venues, the music can play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is located, as breaking through the ice makes quite a terrifying sound for those who are most sensitive.
Cruises from St. Petersburg include a stopover in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible. There are typically no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
Their offer typically includes food, drinks, and entertainment points with which they entertain visitors and keep them with them as long as possible.
At some locations, alcoholic beverages are included in the price. However, intoxication affects judgment, and good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is poor and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to keep you trapped.
Visibility may also be limited due to snowfall or snow carried by the wind, as well as due to condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In everyday use, the term safari means a land journey where we observe African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and with standard equipment, they can be well observed.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you will find it easier to see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "trek") refers to a hike that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events were held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympic Games twice, the first being there in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement, you might be in a difficult position.
Cancellation policies vary, but most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus from the end of March do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to take place.
As expected, most tickets are expected to cost from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing approximately 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes dries them faster. Many hotels rent out irons and ironing boards if they are not already present in the room.
If an iron is not handy or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful that the fabric does not get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or even scorch).
There are several methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, while in other areas it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters differ in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, it is better to buy water in a sealed bottle from a verified company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause hypersensitivity or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, emit toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an option for purchasing goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo – Pittsburgh highway, as it frequently traverses isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on gravel roads, be careful, as steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp bends prevail.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and later sections, usually from 35 to 40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h), and strictly adhering to the limits is even more important than usual.
Surprisingly, the mobile signal here is much stronger than in many other sections of the path, e.g., in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are quite common, as cooked apples are found in pastries throughout the year, while cherries and plums come into play during the summer.
Most German pastries are also characterized by almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes usually pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a pastry that is small but rich, try something that, depending on the region, is called a Berliner doughnut, pancake, or doughnut.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal provinces of this subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Indonesian food is a general term for the wide range of dishes found across the country, which offers as many as 17,000 islands.
However, the term without additional markers mostly refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by a variety of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors that the Javanese adore being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's feet and hang on each side of the saddle.
They offer the rider greater stability, but they can also pose a safety issue as the rider's legs can get caught in them.
If a horse throws the rider off and the rider's foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse could drag him along in case of an escape. To reduce this risk, a number of safety measures can be considered.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety locks that allow the leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during a fall.
The Cochamó Valley – a leading climbing destination in Chile with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs, often called the Yosemite of South America.
The ridge summits offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all corners of the world are still establishing new routes on its walls with endless potential.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity of travelers with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes called "roving skiers" because they plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The concept of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called ski touring or ski mountaineering.
Although it usually does not include elements of these disciplines, it is similar to alpine ski touring or hiking, which are performed on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail as being similar to a hiking trail.
In good weather conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking – but you will rarely achieve the speed of ski touring without a heavy backpack and groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for a visa multiple times and undergoing passport checks.
In this regard, the Schengen Area operates somewhat like a single country.
Within this area, you can cross borders without going through checkpoint controls again, where you would have to show your passport.
If you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen area member state separately, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
A universal definition determining which products are antiques does not exist. Some tax agencies define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies depending on the geographical area, as in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Products of domestic crafts could be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar goods from mass production.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income for the Sámi, and the culture in which this industry is embedded is also important for other professions.
However, according to tradition, not all Sami raised reindeer on a large scale, but rather made their living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mainly for pulling sleds.
Today, many Sámi work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in the region of Sápmi, the area of the Sámi people.
Although the word "Gypsy" is often used, especially among non-Roma, it is often understood as offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect representations of Roma.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to travel advisories, this might affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You might also want to seek advice from a government that is not your own, but whose advice is tailored for its citizens.
For American citizens, the situation in the Middle East will, for example, be different than for Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in each country.
The presented views are often superficial, generalized, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extraordinary weather conditions are a general term for all hazardous weather phenomena that can cause damage, serious societal disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and we know of several different types that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The forms and consequences of extreme weather conditions include strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather storms include snowstorms, snow showers, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of any potential extreme weather conditions in the area, as these may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
If you search for “hostile environment course” on the internet, you will most likely receive the address of a local business.
The course usually covers all the mentioned issues here in much more detail, usually along with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid procedures, and occasionally weapon handling training.
Books and magazines about survival in nature are widespread, but there are only a handful of publications about war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
Not all governments are prepared to issue a passport with an unspecified gender (X) or documents with updated information regarding the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents also varies.
Security checkpoint screenings have become much more intrusive in the period following September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals should not expect to undergo the examination before surgery without an invasion of privacy and with their dignity intact.
Return currents are currents that flow back from waves breaking on the shore, often on reefs or similar formations.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and there a fast current towards the depth can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from swimming back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you manage to escape the current, swimming back will be no different from usual.
Try to steer yourself somewhere you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, wait for rescuers.
The shock upon returning happens sooner than culture shock (there is not such a long honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your own culture.
When you were abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that travelers need to get accustomed to a new country.
Perhaps people do not expect that passengers returning home also need to be patient and understanding.
The sound and light show with the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
Before the start of the performance, you can view the pyramids in darkness and silence.
Usually, one can always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The sphinx serves as the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are depicted on the pyramids and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are under the jurisdiction of several nations and have the most outposts, 16 of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano still serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge here into a plateau, then re-emerge as the 360-km Ellsworth mountain range, which is divided by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range, the highest mountain range in Antarctica, is the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising 4,892 meters high.
In remote areas without mobile signal, you might only be able to get help with a satellite phone.
A satellite phone usually cannot replace a mobile phone because you need to be outdoors and have an unobstructed view of the satellite in order to make a call.
This service is often used in shipping, including cruise vessels, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice services.
Your local telephone service provider can provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is traveling and learning.
It is particularly popular among final year students, as it offers them a gap year before starting their studies without having to compromise their education.
It often happens that education during a one-year stay abroad actually increases the likelihood of an individual continuing their studies in their home country.
Usually, a tuition fee must be paid to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. In addition, the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any kind of yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national sport of Finland, as every seventh or eighth person owns a boat.
It is the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite rare (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most special Baltic cruises include an extended stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that during a visit to the historic city, you can stay for a few days all day long, and at night you can return to the ship and sleep there.
If you only go ashore with ship excursions, you will not need a special visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruises in the brochures mention Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience, regardless of people's age or where they come from, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of it, as it is no different from personal fear and aversion to other things that trouble many people.
If they understand a little bit about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight, it can help some people overcome the fear that arises from the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier services are well paid for quickly delivering items. Often, when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repair, time is very important.
Larger companies have their own airplanes for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies, a problem has arisen.
If they send things by air freight, it may take several days on some routes to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get them through faster is to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to dig deep into your pocket for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
That is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more for business class than for economy class, and eleven times more for first class!
On direct flights from point A to point B, it generally does not make sense to even look for discounts on business or first-class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been shaken by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite unsuccessful political negotiations, economic connections were reestablished between these parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, with around 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub, is the third largest city in Turkey.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and vibrant business center, concentrated around a vast bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and a modern shopping center are accompanied by traditional brick roofs, an 18th-century market, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has a more European Mediterranean atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and there it is also possible to find an unusual octagonal church.
Some of the tombs in the churchyard have interesting marble statues of doves.
It is worth sacrificing half an hour for a walk through this interesting village.
To the north and quite accessible is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron wrote such a brilliant description of its beauties.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can also visit the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a holy site), a place known worldwide for the apparitions of Mary.
Keep in mind that you are actually at a mass grave as well as a place that holds almost unimaginable significance for a large portion of the world's population.
Many men and women who spent their time there are still alive, and even more whose loved ones were murdered there or worked there until death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Behave with dignity, seriousness, and respect, as appropriate. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by marking or scratching graffiti onto buildings.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone can also speak Spanish.
Most of the signs are only in Catalan, which is legally designated as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are communicated using an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often mistaken, you will still get by best in Paris with good manners, by behaving like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-raised). This will make your journey much easier.
The apparent brusqueness of Parisians will quickly dissipate if you show some basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded with forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diverse microclimate, different soils, and elevation, it is known for a wide range of plant communities.
This area provides a home to many different species of animals and birds.
Here you can encounter rare animals such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie, as well as many more common species.
Women must wear skirts that extend below the knees when visiting monasteries, and they must also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries offer cloaks to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it is brightly colored, you will make the monk or nun at the entrance smile.
Similarly, men must also wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow these at the entrance, but you have to know that they are not washed after each use, so they might not be the most comfortable to wear. A universal size is available for men.
Majorcan cuisine, like the cuisines of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in everything.
A simple and popular dish, especially in the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and all possible toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, besides the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way of distinguishing some verbs and objects.
In addition, it is supposed to make reading easier, although writing is somewhat hindered because it is necessary to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in its basic form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You should pay particular attention to the letters c and g, as their pronunciation differs depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and quite regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that you will learn Portuguese more easily if you know another Romance language.
Those who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it is not necessary to learn it separately.
Observatories from the pre-modern era are now outdated and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Because in their golden days, light pollution wasn't as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or campuses and are more accessible than those built later.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept came from China, where Japanese apricots were the most common choice of flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor, and they were organized for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick a specimen, even if "just one."
When visiting a formally arranged garden, you will be kicked out without debate for collecting "specimens."
Singapore is generally a very safe city and easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
In the "hot tropical zone," just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with heat (constantly) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which happens rarely).
Some buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The continental waterways can be a good guiding theme for organizing a trip.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to interesting cities along the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.
They are also used as popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many customs associated with this holiday have also been adopted by nonbelievers from Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
According to tradition, one should stay awake on Easter night at some exposed place and await the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it can also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In more traditional churches, during the Easter weekend on Saturday night, an Easter vigil often takes place, where at midnight the gathering often turns into a celebration of Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands swam, flew, or floated here.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived on the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
You will be offered a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as it is mostly dark all day during that period.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and there are generally no issues with light pollution, you will also be able to admire the stars.
The work culture in Japan may be more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or job title.
At the workplace, harmony is essential, with teamwork being more important than glorifying individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their superiors for every decision, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
