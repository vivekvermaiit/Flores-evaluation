Despite the fact that one of the vaccines in the experimental stage may be able to reduce the mortality rate from Ebola fever, so far no drug has clearly demonstrated its suitability for treating the infection that already exists.
Initially, one of the antibody cocktails, ZMapp, seemed promising in this area; however, official studies demonstrated that its benefit was less than required to prevent death.
During the PALM clinical trials, the drug Zmapp was used as a control. This means it was used as a benchmark to compare the other three drugs against.

This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information that cannot usually be obtained by studying fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the feathers.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on top and had a pale or reddish-yellow hue on the underside.
This discovery allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed shaft — rachis, but have other features of feathers — barbules and barbs, researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a late evolutionary change compared to other features.
Judging by the structure of the feather, it can be concluded that it was used not for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or attract attention. Researchers allowed for the possibility that, despite it being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows not the down of a chick, but adult plumage.
Researchers suggest that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen may show the plumage of an adult animal, rather than a chick's down.

The voting process in France has traditionally not been high-tech. Voters would close themselves in a booth to take out a pre-printed sheet of paper showing the name of the respective candidate and put it into an envelope.
After the voter's identification by officials, the latter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
This entire procedure is carried out in strict accordance with the electoral law of France.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent. This is done so that voters and observers can verify that at the beginning of voting there were no envelopes in the boxes and that no other envelopes (except those cast into the ballot boxes by duly authorized and counted voters) were placed there.
To witness each part of the process, candidates may send their representatives. In the evening, following certain procedures, volunteers, who are under strict supervision, count the votes.

According to some reports, eight people have died. Official reports mention an approximate number of 30 injured. However, the final figures are still unknown.
In urine samples from pets that died after consuming contaminated feed, both cyanuric acid and melamine were found.
Researchers from the university stated that these two compounds react with each other and form crystals that can block kidney function.
The addition of melamine and cyanuric acid to cat urine resulted in the formation of crystals, as observed by researchers.
According to the results of the infrared spectroscopic analysis, the structure and composition of these crystals are similar to the structure and composition of those found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you understand this or not, but most of the goods imported into this country from Central America are not subject to duties.
At the same time, eighty percent of our goods in Central America were subject to taxes.
It seemed pointless and, of course, unfair to me.
I always tell people — you treat us the same way we treat you.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Governor of California, approved a bill prohibiting the sale or rental of video games with a high level of violence to minors.

Schneider gave testimony from his own country via video link, while he was located at a US Navy base.
Apart from the competitions on Wednesday, Karpaneda also participated in two more individual races at the championship.
At first, she participated in the slalom, where she went off course in the first run. 36 out of 116 competition participants showed the same result.
During the giant slalom event, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position. Her total time was 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes behind the first place, taken by Austrian Claudia Lösch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth place, taken by Jongy Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers from the group of athletes with disabilities did not reach the finish line, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to qualify for the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to the owner by the Madhya Pradesh state police.

He was eventually transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekeye has since been in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh because she is accused of murdering her son.
She is awaiting charges and trial while in custody. However, considering that her photographs have been published in many places, any eyewitness testimonies may be called into question.
In other regions of the United Kingdom, this is common practice; however, in Scotland, the judiciary operates differently—the courts believe that the publication of photographs could potentially be harmful.
"It seems journalists are treading a dangerous path when they publish photos, etc., of suspects," notes Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Chancellery of the High Court, authorized to bring criminal charges, informed journalists that at least until an indictment is issued, no further comments will be available.
According to the received information, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in a way that preserves the boundaries that existed before the start of the 1967 war in the Middle East.
According to the received information, among other topics covered by the document are the issues of the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both peoples, as well as the problem of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands that after the signing of the agreement, military presence in the valley be maintained for ten years, while Palestine agrees to only five years.
The shooters who participated in the additional program for controlling the spread of animals were to be closely monitored by rangers because the program was being monitored and its effectiveness was being assessed.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service, together with the Australian Sporting Shooters Association, Inc., recruited qualified volunteers to participate in the shooting program implemented under the auspices of the Sporting Shooters Association.
Mick Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service for park protection and heritage, stated that the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation were given comprehensive safety instructions and provided with appropriate training.
Yesterday, Marteli swore in a new Interim Electoral Council, which consists of nine members.
This is already Martéi's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the early dissolution of the Interim Election Council as one of numerous measures to prepare the country for new elections.
Marteli responded to the large anti-regime protests that began in October with a commission.
The cause of the protests, which were sometimes violent and fierce, was the lack of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods were registered. This led to six fires, and four people sustained minor burns.
According to the statement by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI), information about the 27 accidents that occurred as a result of using the devices was included in them.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan announced that it had received a notice from Apple about 34 new cases of overheating, which it classified as "non-serious".
In response, the ministry called the postponement of the report by the company "Apple" to a later date "worthy of sincere regret."
An earthquake hit the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 Friday GMT).

Moreover, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of the natural disaster.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila, and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with his M16.
Several hostages were rescued, and at this time, according to confirmed data, at least six were killed.
Six hostages, among whom were elderly people and children, as well as photographers from the Philippines, were released ahead of schedule.
The elderly lady needed to go to the bathroom, so the photographers were taken hostage instead of her. Mendoza was shot.
Lingins followed his father's example and became a doctor.
He studied to be an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in the city of Auckland.
When Liggins was working in the hospital, he began studying the problem of premature births in his free time.
According to his research, the introduction of the hormone accelerates the maturation of the embryo's lungs.
According to a report by the Xinhua agency, government investigators on Wednesday found two so-called "black boxes" — flight data recorders.
Luna's memory was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. She passed away on the night of the two moons. This is quite original, just like she was. Luna was a strong woman," said Tony Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels noted: "Luna was quite the oddball, no less than me... maybe even more... I love her, and I will miss her... I want to believe that she is in a better place now."
The number of people who express opposition to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a survey of 1,400 people conducted prior to the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, the acting Prime Minister, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of the survey participants. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of respondents who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent who, on the contrary, hold the opinion that this should never happen.
It was expected that the Olympic gold medalist would swim 100 and 200 meters freestyle and participate in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition is in doubt: he quite frequently complained about his health.
He didn't have the opportunity to take painkillers because they are prohibited at the Games.
On January 25, a mathematician and professor of computer science from the University of Central Missouri, Curtis Cooper, found the largest known prime number to date.
This discovery was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is assumed that comets could have brought to Earth not only organic substances that can form proteins and serve as a source of life support, but also water.
Considering that in the distant past comets collided with the Earth, scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, particularly that of Earth.
Earlier this year, 53-year-old Cuomo was elected governor. He signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriages last month.
"He dismissed these rumors as 'political chatter and nonsense.'"
It is expected that in 2016 he will run for president.
The Federal Aviation Administration states that thanks to the NextGen system, airplanes will be able to fly on shorter routes, which will help save millions of liters of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
Unlike older ground-based radars, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to determine the location of airplanes more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
The amount of transport is not increasing, and overground trains will not stop at "Wembley", moreover, there is no parking for cars at ground level, nor is there a park-and-ride facility.
The likelihood of having to hold the game behind closed doors without the team's fans was increasing, as it is entirely possible that there will not be enough transport vehicles.
About the formation of a new species of birds in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands is written in a study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
According to a report by researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of a new species occurred in just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process required much more time. The emergence of a new species became possible due to the crossbreeding of the endemic Geospiza forte and the non-native Geospiza conirostris.
Various shapes can be cast from gold. It can be rolled into thin sheets.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can then be easily twisted and braided. In addition, it can be hammered thin or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It could be so thin that from time to time it was used to decorate illustrations painted in books — the so-called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH level of a certain chemical substance. You can make such an acid-base indicator yourself from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity level of a particular substance.
The pH level in the experimental chemical is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as it is known, a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir these two dry powders in a circular motion until they combine into a single mass, then use wet hands to form them into a ball.
Moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation. At the same time, a kind of shell is formed.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
In the houses of the Greek cities in Crete and Santorini, which belong to the Minoan period, remnants of sewer systems were found.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths, where women and men were present together.
You use a satellite when calling someone who is thousands of kilometers away from you.
In space, a satellite receives a call and then almost instantly reflects it back.
A rocket was used to send a satellite into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes light to refract, distorting the image.
In order for a telescope or satellite to reach space, a huge rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. Easier and faster movement is the greatest thing the wheel has done for us.
Thanks to him, we now have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below are medium-sized cats. Their prey is also medium-sized—they hunt both rabbits and antelope with deer.
In addition to everything, many small cats (including free-range pets) catch and eat more abundant small prey — insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the fact that each occupies its own niche, i.e., has a function unique to it, and therefore it does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are one of the most social cats: they live in large groups known as prides.
A pride may include up to three adult males, who are relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, the females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides and packs of wolves or dogs is similar in many ways. The latter can strongly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior in that they pose a mortal danger to their prey.
A tiger is capable of climbing (though not very well), leaping across great distances, swimming, and pulling with a force five times stronger than a strong man, like a well-trained athlete.
The tiger belongs to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera). No other cats, except these four, can roar.
The roar of a tiger resembles more a sentence composed of sharp and loud words than the full-bodied roar of a lion.
Ocelots use small animals as food. When possible, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds. Almost all animals they hunt are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smelling traces on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they see well in the dark and move very confidently. Ocelots hunt by blending into their surroundings and attacking their prey from hiding.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they originate (say, by crossing a river or mountain range or if such living creatures migrate to a new island, making it quite difficult for them to return), they often find themselves in an environment that is significantly different from the place they came from.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so for the new population to become a strong competitor itself, it will need different traits or adaptations compared to those it had before.
The original population has not changed at all: as before, it still needs to adapt.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the animals increasingly resemble less the main population from which they separated.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass, and sooner or later the two mentioned populations will look so different that no one would think to consider them the same species.
We call this process speciation, which actually means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe. In addition to this, they consume carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants "prepare" food for themselves from sunlight through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from them. We mainly eat plants. And animals would also not survive without plants.
For their time, mosasaurs were superpredators, so they feared nothing and no one, except other mosasaurs.
On his long jaws, over 70 razor-sharp teeth were displayed, and in the upper part of the mouth, there was an additional row. This meant that his prey would have no chance of escaping.
It is not exactly known, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. The diet of mosasaurs consisted of large fish, turtles, and other mosasaurs. It is likely that they could also eat members of their own species.
Moreover, he pounced on everything that fell into the water; his catch was not worthy even of a giant like the Tyrannosaurus rex.
Despite the fact that their food would mostly not surprise us, certain dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them were wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent known as the edible dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy held banquets where they ate while reclining.
The dishes prepared in Ancient Rome could not include products that later came to Europe from America or Asia.
They did not have, in particular, neither potatoes, nor tomatoes, nor corn, nor cocoa. It should also be added that no ancient Roman ever had the opportunity to taste turkey.
The inhabitants of Babylon built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered their home.
The believers brought sacrifices to their gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs by conducting various festivals and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had its own open inner courtyard and sanctuary, where only priests could visit.
In some cases, during the construction of temples, special towers similar to pyramids were erected. They were known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to a god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not have much significance.
For the most part, the life of a Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women cooked outdoors; the shops were just open stalls facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
In Canaan, large forests were absent, so timber was of great value.
The territory of Greenland was not densely populated. According to Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and, sailing west, he came across Greenland, which he named 'Green Land'.
But regardless of its discovery, tribes of Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Despite each of these countries being "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there was a treasure map.
However, this does not correspond to reality. Although something is indeed written on the reverse side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, it was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The inverted writing is located at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows for sure, but it is known that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was initially rolled up for preservation.
Therefore, it is quite possible that this entry was added there simply as a note.
Thanks to the landing in Normandy and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
He was under the rule of the "Vichyists." These were the French who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation "Dragoon" began - the Allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the Free French forces liberated the southern territories of France in just two weeks, after which they headed towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people who work and live together in a society.
The aforementioned term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "civil." The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, that is, "citizen," as well as to the noun civitas, or "city" or "city-state." All of this, in turn, somehow says something about the size of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through generations, uniform dissemination, and a sustainable cultural footprint.
Often, small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word because they disappear without leaving significant historical evidence behind.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government in accordance with the Articles of Confederation of the thirteen states. This government consisted only of Congress.
The congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive and judicial power, it relied on the enforcement of all laws with the support of state bodies, which were often not inclined to cooperate.
Moreover, he lacked the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs imposed by the states.
According to the Articles of Confederation, unanimous consent of all the states was required to make amendments, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, just like the German national team, ranks second among the strongest national teams in the world. In 2006, it won the FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing belong to the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, even though Italians also participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan spans nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu Island. Thanks to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective, as it represents a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century. It was then that its name was recorded by European sailors passing by as "Formosa," which meant "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the territory of southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of the primitive farming practices. For the cultivation of rice and sugar plantations, the company hired Chinese workers.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) captured the western and northern Taiwanese territories in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government, in 1895, signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which Japan was granted sovereignty over the island, and the latter governed Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
In order for tourists to get a better impression of what most of the buildings at the edges of the complex originally looked like, the latter have been reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
Yes, the most popular photographic format for still frames in the world is the 35mm format. At the dawn of the analog photography era, this film format prevailed.
Such film is still being produced today, however, more importantly, the ratio of its width to height is now used in the matrix formats of digital cameras.
It can be a bit confusing, but in fact, the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Accordingly, it is considered that the aspect ratio for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler ratio of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Similar or identical aspect ratios are shared by many common formats (for example, the APS format family).
The rule of thirds, which is often criticized and mocked, provides simple guidelines that ensure dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
If you believe him, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photograph into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the activities of the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
Despite all those linguistic and cultural differences that existed, the Christian religion united European countries for more than a thousand years.
Everyone—from the king to the commoner—was under her all-encompassing authority.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and alleviate suffering, and also that this is precisely the purpose for which the church's funds exist.
For more than a thousand years, the central church authorities have been located in Rome. Due to such a concentration of power and money, many question whether this dogma is being fulfilled.
The United Kingdom initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The embargo on the supply of vital goods for military and civilian purposes, although it violated universally recognized international law that had been established at the legislative level by several international agreements over the past two centuries, turned out to be an effective strategy.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent ships from entering certain areas of the ocean. By doing so, it endangered even neutral vessels.
Due to the fact that no significant reaction to this tactic was observed, Germany considered that there would also be no reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Among the majority of citizens and countries during the 1920s, the sentiments of pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
States and nations intended to avoid such a situation in the future, as they had already witnessed the horrors and atrocities during the First World War.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work for the "Edison" company located in New York.
Only 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job), were in his pocket when he arrived in the USA.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to designate different eras. At each stage of China's history or within each ruling family, there were distinct dynasties.
In addition, the periods of dynastic rule were separated by periods of divided provinces when instability reigned. The most famous of these was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During the mentioned periods, many nobles who fought for the throne waged merciless battles among themselves.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the era of the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people died during the struggle for the opportunity to occupy the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them were the transition from absolutism to a republican system of governance, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs not to a sole ruler but to the entire nation.
Moreover, various positions after the Revolution became available to all male candidates, as a result of which the most successful and ambitious rose to the top.
The same happened in the army, because whereas earlier military ranks were awarded based on class, now they are awarded based on abilities and skills.
Moreover, the French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the bounds of secular life. To engage in meditation and contemplation, he often visited a cave on Mount Nur (translated as "light"), which is known as "Hira."
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid idea of the spiritual foundations of Muhammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world — it is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if someone knows of its existence. Inside the cave, you are in complete isolation.
Apart from the clear beautiful skies above and many surrounding mountains, you will see nothing. Very little of this world can be seen and heard from the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to our time.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that were erected to honor the memory of the deceased pharaoh. It was built in the third century BC.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a series of smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were dedicated to the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The symbol that indicates an upward bow movement looks like a "V", and downward — like a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
"Bow movement upward" means you should start the movement from the tip of the bow and move it upward, and "bow movement downward" means you should start from the frog (this is the place where your hand holds the bow) and move the bow downward.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement gives a stronger and more confident one.
You can make your marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed bow symbols are there not just by chance, but for a certain musical reason, so they usually need to be preserved.
On October 6, 1789, due to a crowd of women from the market, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie Thérèse), as well as Madame Élisabeth, the king's sister, had to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family was taken to Paris in a carriage. On the way, they were surrounded by a crowd - people in it whistled, shouted, and yelled threats at the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the carriage windows under the influence of the crowd of people.
At a certain moment, someone from the crowd waved the head of a guard killed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was already frightened to death.
The military expenses of the U.S. imperialists incurred in the conquest of the Philippines had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To cover a significant portion of the expenses and interest on bonds that were issued through Wall Street bank houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the US imperialists would be the super-profits brought by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To imagine who the Templars were, it is necessary to understand well what the prerequisites for the creation of the order were.
Traditionally, the era during which these events took place is called the Classical Middle Ages — this is the period in European history that covers the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
At first there was the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and after it, the Late Middle Ages. The latter, as it is commonly believed, ended around the year 1500.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from the push to promote certain technologies or technical necessity to the clear understanding that human destiny is determined by the logic on which scientific laws are based, and their embodiment in the realm of technology.
Two general ideas are characteristic of most explanations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself largely progresses outside the boundaries of cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, exerts an influence inherent to it (rather than socially conditioned) on society.
In particular, there is an opinion that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
Nevertheless, if the number of cars is small, a nationwide network of highways does not make economic sense. For this reason, new methods of production are being developed that will allow reducing the cost of car ownership.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is increasing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of healthcare that allow for the treatment of various injuries.
A huge element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
When talking about the Romanticism era, people were strongly influenced by the geography of their surroundings. Over time, traditions and culture associated with it emerged. They were better than arbitrarily imposed laws because they existed in harmony with the place and situation that society occupied.
While Paris is considered the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 CE, the city gains fame as a center of luxury and maintains this status almost until 1100 CE.
During the 12th century, its status as a capital of luxury faded. This happened mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts, among which were exotic spices and silk, and they were valued much higher than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was then that Constantinople ceded the title of fashion capital to Paris.
The flourish of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
Initially, the strong influence on clothing style was exerted by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles may be delayed by 25–30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style by the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing became one of the major events of that time.
In a subsistence farming system, a quantity of food products is produced that exclusively meets the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming represents a simple and, typically, organic system. It is based on using preserved seeds inherent to a specific ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other fairly straightforward methods. The goal of all this is to achieve maximum productivity.
Many farmers have historically practiced subsistence farming. Now, many third-world countries still practice it.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views who feel neglected in terms of social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a separate subculture can be based on various factors — linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination thereof.
Members of the same subculture often identify their belonging to it through a distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, behavior, and jargon.
As an illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, the example most often given is of children who were unfortunate enough to grow up in an atmosphere of disdain, neglect, various hardships, or humiliation and insults, and who were not socialized by adults in childhood.
Such children are called "wild." Some "wild" children have been in captivity for a long time (usually, this was how their own parents treated them); in some cases, the lack of parental care was a result of the parents' unwillingness to notice serious physical or intellectual disabilities and deficiencies in the child.
Before they were abandoned or ran away, the wild children might have experienced serious abuse or trauma.
Others, apparently, were raised by animals; according to rumors, some lived independently in the wild.
If a child was entirely raised by animals, its behavior in almost every respect (considering physical limitations) mirrors that of the animal caretaker: for example, such a child may fear people or be indifferent to them.
While the goal of project-based learning is to make the educational process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes even further in this regard.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather an assistant that helps people gain new experience in learning. This may mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, a teacher and the little paperclip in the Microsoft Office program are both assistants.
The software includes virtual assistants. They are needed for asking questions, giving hints, and explaining procedures that a student or listener finds difficult to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children may end up in foster families. It can be due to abuse, neglect, or even coercion.
Children should not be allowed to grow up in an environment where no one cares for them, they are not being raised, and their education is neglected, but this still happens.
In our view, the foster care system is a safe zone for such children.
It is assumed that thanks to our foster care system, the wards will have reliable medical care, safe homes, good and caring guardians, and stable education.
It is believed that a foster family must provide for all the needs of a child that were not being met in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet is a means not only of mass communication but also of interpersonal communication.
Thanks to the special characteristics of the Internet, additional opportunities arise for its use and for meeting the needs of the audience.
For example, there is an opinion that concepts such as “education” and “socialization” are significant motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" were also defined by Eimi and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation in the study of audience response to internet sites.
Thanks to video recording, important discoveries were made in explaining micro-expressions — referring to muscle movements of the face that last only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, among other things, that the correct interpretation of microexpressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks noted how people with brain damage, despite not understanding the language itself, can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that animals — for example, domestic dogs — may also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
Research findings of the twentieth century indicate that there are two sources of genetic variability, namely, explicit and hidden variations.
Under the influence of mutations, new genetic variations arise, and with the help of selection, they are removed from the pool of detected ones.
With each subsequent generation, segregation and recombination mix variations in these two pools.
The available plant resources in the savanna cannot satisfy the primates' amino acid needs if their digestive system is similar to that of humans.
Moreover, if they fail to do this, the consequences can be serious. This includes malnutrition, growth depression, and inevitable death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins that can be found in legumes and foliage. However, if they are not properly prepared, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
On the contrary, animal-derived food (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of proteins, rich in all the necessary amino acids, and is easily digestible at the same time.
Judging by everything, it should come as no surprise if it turns out that our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" almost in the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep interruption refers to the intentional awakening of a sleeping person during a normal sleep process and falling asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up, but not completely.
If it turns out that you change the clock in your sleep, try placing it at the other end of the room. That way, you will need to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other options based on biorhythms, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluids (primarily water or tea, known as a diuretic) before going to bed — this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the tension of their body and spirit.
The inherent life force is more positive the lower the tension. Absolute calm and satisfaction are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can be achieved by everyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
The foundation of Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, which were supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and a series of techniques from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all humanity.
Followers of Kundalini yoga claim that to awaken the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment), one must practice certain yoga poses, mantras, and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a central part of Tibetan meditation practice. Visualization of different deities allows for the purification of energy channels, the opening of chakras, and the attainment of enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to disputes between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins — former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years and it truly involved armies from friendly countries. The battlefields were located in various regions — from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense was shattered by September 17, 1939. Retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
However, in just one night these plans lost their significance, as over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army from the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts entered the territory of Poland's eastern regions, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Shipping by sea is clearly the most efficient way to transport a large number of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the naval forces was to ensure that their country was capable of transporting people and goods, while at the same time preventing the opponent from transporting their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War became one of the most significant examples of this idea. With the aim of aiding Great Britain, the Americans strived to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the aforementioned movement, mainly using submarines for this purpose.
Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain in the same way it conquered the rest of Europe, if the Allies had failed.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Iranian Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them in order to always have milk, wool, meat, and skins at hand.
Domestic goats usually grazed in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures. They were often looked after by goat herders — children or teenagers. The latter acted as shepherds. This is how animals are still herded today.
As early as the 16th century, packhorse roads were built in England.
Although the plank roads were merely parallel wooden boards, they allowed draft horses to move at higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the existing uneven roads.
Sleepers began to be used to hold the rails in place quite early. However, after some time it became clear that movement along the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, but due to the presence of iron, the wooden wagon wheels wore out faster.
After some time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. The first entirely metal rails appeared in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means "upright man"), people began to walk upright.
Australopithecines, their predecessors, usually did not walk upright.
Erect-walking specimens of Australopithecus have been found in fossils dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, but it is entirely possible that seven million years ago Sahelanthropus was already walking on two legs.
One can take a more conscious approach to the environment, become part of the environmental movement, or even become an activist, so that in the future the mentioned sufferings do not become very strong.
Often it looks more like symptomatic treatment. However, if we need more than just a temporary solution, we must find and eliminate the root of the problem.
It is quite obvious that thanks to technical and scientific achievements of humanity, the world has changed significantly. As a result of overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of people, the number of problems has increased.
After the declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to the printing office of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read this document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy reached London.
25 original printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides) have survived to our time. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and that they still exist today, only we call them birds.
Because of feathers and the ability to fly, many people do not consider them dinosaurs.
But birds still have many features in common with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, lay eggs, and, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, walk on two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers perform operations with information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
The composition of binary numbers can include only one of two values — 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs. For example, vomiting is a quite common symptom, making it impossible to establish an immediate diagnosis.
An open container with pills or toxic household chemicals can primarily indicate internal poisoning.
Instructions for providing emergency medical assistance for this particular poison should be looked at on the label.
To denote this group of insects, entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense.
This term originated because people have long known what bed bugs are — these insects are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both kissing bugs and bed bugs are nesting parasites, they have adapted to living in the nests or in the home of their host.
Around 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been registered in the United States of America. Consequently, this neurological disorder is the most common among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. The latter includes the brain and spinal cord, as well as the optic nerve.
According to the results of the study, it was found that women suffer from MS twice as often as men.
The couple may come to the conclusion that raising a baby does not align with their interests or the interests of the child they already have.
Such couples can put their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents of the child relinquish their parental rights so that other couples can raise and nurture the child.
The main goal of science is to determine through the scientific method how the world functions. In fact, most scientific research is conducted using this method.
However, there is not only it. An experiment (this is a test that is conducted to exclude one or more possible hypotheses through questions and observations) also directs and stimulates scientific research.
Most of all, philosophers and naturalists paid attention to classical texts. First and foremost, this includes, among other things, the Bible in Latin.
The generally accepted views at that time were considered to be Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including in the field of psychology.
When the number of people who knew Greek decreased, the West found itself cut off from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorhythms observed in the behavior and physiology of animals are largely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles. These cycles arise as a result of the functioning of the biological clock.
Most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have been observed to have periodic rhythms that are not a direct reaction to external periodic signals.
The biological clock represents an autonomous process. Even if external signals do not occur, this process continues in the form of independently free-running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses, which claimed that DNA is the genetic material, was tested during the Hershey and Chase experiment.
To implant their own DNA into bacteria, Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments where they labeled the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of genetic material where the mutation occurred, and whether the cells affected by it are germline cells, mutations can have a wide range of consequences.
Only mutations in germ cells can be hereditary. Other mutations may result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts those people who are interested in visiting various natural zones and areas, as they want to enjoy the general view and landscape, including the pleasure of observing the flora and fauna.
As examples of outdoor activities, one can mention fishing, hunting, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
An example can be visiting, studying, and photographing orangutans on the island of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of their small provincial towns in their cars to go to work. On the way, they pass by other people who work in the places they have just left.
In this dynamic transport cycle, everyone has some connection to the car-based transport system and supports it.
Scientific data indicates that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has significantly contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
All people who participate in the life of society use transport systems. And almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries, you are unlikely to hear as many complaints about bridge collapses or water quality.
Why are transportation systems a constant source of such complaints, why do they regularly stop working? Is the reason hidden in insufficiently competent transport engineers? Or is something more significant happening?
The concept of "traffic movement" implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows presents a complex problem because it is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with 100% certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, usually behave fairly consistently; therefore, as a rule, traffic flows are characterized by a certain rationally determined sequence and can be approximately described using mathematical models.
To more fully and accurately demonstrate the nature of vehicle movement, it was established how the three main parameters are interrelated: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The presence of these connections helps to plan and design road facilities, as well as manage their operation.
The first animals to take to the air were insects. The ability to fly helped them evade predators more effectively, as well as find mates and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects fold along the body.
Thanks to this, they can squeeze into various very small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects nowadays that cannot fold their wings.
One man, named Aristarchus, claimed several thousand years ago that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some believed that he was right, but many held a different opinion—that the Solar System (including the Sun and other stars) revolves around the Earth.
Sounds reasonable, because, being on Earth, it's hard to claim that it is moving, isn't it?
The Amazon River ranks second on Earth in length among all other rivers and is the largest of them. The volume of water in it is 8 times greater than in the river that ranks second.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes reaching a width of six miles.
The Amazon contributes at least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet.
The Amazon River, into which waters from thousands of smaller rivers flow, has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles).
Although the construction of pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom era, in terms of size and technical perfection, no one ever surpassed the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were amazed by the monuments built by their ancestors, which at that time were over a thousand years old.
Only about 800 people reside in Vatican City. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
Italian is used in the legislation and official communications of the Vatican.
Most of those who work in the public sector use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is often used in religious rites.
All residents of Vatican City belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Thanks to the fact that essential chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools, people have known about them since ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that claimed that any substance consists of one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although according to his theory, they can transform into other substances, eventually becoming what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements similar to calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Moreover, there are alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic components. Such a non-metallic component can be, for example, carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles — atoms.
The size of atoms is so small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the significance of the pencil and the frequency of its use declined as new writing methods emerged.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, and no one needs a pencil sharpener.
We can only speculate what fate awaits the keyboard when it is replaced by something fundamentally new.
The principle of a plutonium bomb consists in using the energy of nuclear fusion, where a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It's like pushing a very heavy cart up a hill. Repeated nuclear fission will release some of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they have a tendency to decay under slight external influence or even without it.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust's thickness on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side, it is about 100 km.
Under the lunar seas, the Moon's crust is thinner, while under the highlands, it is thicker.
There may be more lunar seas on the side of the moon closest to us because the crust is thinner here, and accordingly, it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Substantive theories focus on what drives people or what attracts them.
The mentioned theories are based on the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires that they convert into internal ones and to which they assign a subjective character (in other words, internalize) during maturation.
The mentioned theories describe what exactly compels certain individuals to want what they engage in, and which factors in their environment may influence whether they will do certain things.
"Maslow's 'Hierarchy of Needs' theory and Herzberg's 'Two-Factor Theory' represent two authoritative content theories."
Essentially, when leaders are promoted to lead their former colleagues, two types of behaviors may emerge. At one end of the spectrum, there will be attempts to remain "one of the guys" (or "one of the girls").
A manager who belongs to this type may experience difficulties with assessing work efficiency, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, distributing responsibility, and holding those at fault accountable.
Another extreme is the situation where a person changes beyond recognition — feels the need to change everything the team has done so far and appropriates it as their own.
Ultimately, the responsibility for the team's successes and failures rests with the leader.
Such behavior often ends in conflicts between the leaders and the other team members.
The standards of excellence for regular teams should be followed by virtual teams as well, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members usually act as a contact center for the corresponding real group.
Considering that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be clear to local management.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
A team of leaders, to which each member is subordinate, is the so-called "invisible team." It sets standards for each member.
For what reason might an organization want to undergo a lengthy procedure to establish an educational institution? Innovations are one of the purposes of applying organizational learning concepts in practice.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
Thus, the process used by an organization, whose employees strive together to overcome some obstacle, can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process that satisfies client needs.
The management of the organization should create a culture characterized by innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning. Only after this can the organization be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), the continuous approach represents a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
A theoretical approach to the study of cognition is supported by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. Thus, the field of study is narrowed and becomes more precise.
The results of the research obtained by scientists are confirmed by the presence of a close relationship between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has long been known that various types of cranio-cerebral injuries, focal lesions, formations, plaques, pathological changes, and tumors in the brain affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to explore the structure of the brain and processes within it that are still unknown to us.
Thanks to this, we receive a huge amount of materials and data for building simulation models, which, in turn, help us understand the processes that occur in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" usually evokes associations with science fiction, in reality, AI is a very important field of computer science that deals with the study of behavior, the learning process, and the intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to make machines automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
As an example, one can cite planning and control, the ability to respond to client requests and technical issues, as well as recognizing faces, voices, and handwriting.
They have distinguished themselves into separate disciplines that study real-life problems and propose solutions for them.
Nowadays, AI is often used in the economy, medicine, technology, and military fields. In addition, it is a component of the software for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions constitute a significant part of school education. Often, a teacher takes students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
With the help of modern technologies, virtual tours can be organized. Students can become acquainted with museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of works of art. And all of this — without leaving the classroom.
Joint participation in virtual tours is also a very good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences in future classes.
Students from Bennett School in North Carolina, for example, create a website about their trip to the state capital every year, and every year they redesign it, but older versions remain online in the form of an album.
Moreover, blogging can improve students' writing skills. Although their grammar and spelling often "limp" at the beginning of blogging, this usually changes for the better, thanks to the presence of an audience.
Considering that students are usually the most discerning audience, the blog author does everything possible to improve their style to avoid criticism.
Besides, maintaining a blog "helps students better understand the world around them." The need to keep the audience's interest inspires them and forces them to remain capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging fosters collaboration and encourages students to learn much more than the traditional school approach offers.
If students use blogs properly, they "will be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; actively responding to Internet materials will help students define their own position on what others have written, as well as express their own views on specific issues" (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find numerous art galleries and museums that provide an opportunity to get acquainted with the country's past and its present.
Niagara Falls lies further south, while to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its untouched natural beauty.
That is why, among many other reasons, tourists, visitors, and other foreigners consider Ontario a typical Canadian province.
In significant parts of its territory, which are located further to the north, very few people live, and some are almost complete deserts devoid of people.
For comparison, we can present the following fact, which surprises many: the number of African Americans in the USA exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located near the eastern coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Undoubtedly, Madagascar is the largest of them. When it comes to wildlife, it can be compared to a separate continent.
Almost all smaller islands are either independent states or belong to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
Moreover, the Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros Islands and the island of Mayotte.
Until the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, marks the beginning of European influence and colonialism policies.
The northern border of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western border is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female tourists are advised to always say that they are married, even if they are not.
In addition, it might be useful to wear a ring (one that does not look too expensive).
Women need to understand that as a result of cultural differences they may encounter behaviors that seem like harassment. Locals often might bother female tourists, grab them by the arms, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and boldly assert your opinion (despite cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used this city as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city, and then rebuilt it again under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the earthquake of 1755, they abandoned this place.
The Moroccan sultan restored the city and named it Dār al-Bayḍāʾ. The name Casablanca was given to the city by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
Next to the Old Town of Medina, one can quickly find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold — leather goods, pottery, tagines, hookahs, and various trinkets, though they are all intended solely for tourists.
Goma is a city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda, which is popular with tourists.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano wiped Goma off the face of the earth. It buried under itself the majority of the city streets, mainly in the city center.
Despite the fact that the city of Goma itself is quite safe, one should conduct a small investigation before leaving its limits to find out whether there are any ongoing hostilities in the North Kivu province at any given moment.
Additionally, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano. Very cheap services are also offered here for gorilla watching enthusiasts — it's hard to find more attractive prices in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of Timbuktu's relative inaccessibility, its name began to be used as a metaphor for distant exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and the presence of an airport, today Timbuktu is a city plagued by poverty.
In 1990, due to the threat from the desert sands, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites that are in danger.
Henry Louis Gates paid much attention to this city in the PBS channel program "Wonders of the African Continent."
Compared to other cities in the country, the city stands out even more because it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa. To the east, it borders Mozambique, to the north — Zimbabwe, and its southern boundary runs along the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19,500 km². It contains 14 ecozones, each of which is home to different animals and plants.
It is one of the most interesting places in the country and is also considered the most significant of the National Parks in South Africa.
As in all national parks of the Republic of South Africa, the park charges a daily entrance fee and collects an environmental levy from visitors.
In addition, purchasing the so-called Wild Card — a pass that grants access to several parks in South Africa or all national parks in the country — might prove advantageous.
The name of the country Hong Kong is borrowed from Hong Kong Island, which is a major attraction for many tourists.
The beautiful buildings of Hong Kong, which shape the city's architectural appearance, are compared to a gleaming bar chart, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only emphasize its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be enjoyed by leaving the island and heading to the promenade of Kowloon located opposite.
A significant part of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern coast on reclaimed land.
In the past, this place was captured by colonizers from Great Britain, so if you want to see evidence of the country's colonial past with your own eyes, you should start from here.
The Sundarbans Forest is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and the interior of India.
UNESCO has declared Sundarbans a World Heritage site. The part of the forest located in India is called the "Sundarbans National Park."
Not only are mangrove swamps called forests, but they are also some of the last dense jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain and still remain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which water bodies or swamps occupy about one-third.
The Sundarbans forest has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and currently, it is reported that 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer are in this region.
From the inter-district bus station (located across the river), buses depart throughout the day. However, in most cases, they leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar (located in the Bumtang area).
Due to the fact that inter-district buses are often crowded, it is recommended to purchase tickets a couple of days before the trip.
Comfortable and reliable small Coaster buses produced in Japan serve most areas.
A minibus is a comfortable and convenient way to reach nearby places, such as the cities of Punakha (fare - 200 ngultrums) and Paro (fare - 150 ngultrums).
The bridge that spans across the Oyapock is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the banks of the Oyapock River, on which two cities are located — Oiapoque (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock (French Guiana).
The height of the two pylons is 83 meters. The length of the bridge is 378 meters. The roadway consists of two lanes, each with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The bridge was opened for traffic only in March 2017, despite its construction being completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will become fully operational in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani, who led a semi-nomadic hunter lifestyle and also engaged in subsistence agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous people inhabiting the territory of present-day Eastern Paraguay.
Other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Payaguá and the Guaicurú, lived in the Chaco region. To survive, they engaged in hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India," actually emerged in the 16th century when Spanish conquerors encountered indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards began a three-hundred-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve its uniqueness and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place at the camping sites in Las Kanitas.

Information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be obtained from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). It is worth the same as the British pound (GBP).
On the Falkland Islands, currency can only be exchanged at the only bank in the entire country, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the "FIC West" store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted for payment anywhere on the islands. Additionally, in Stanley itself, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted.
On remote islands, they will likely not accept credit cards. At the same time, they might accept British or American cash; ask the owners in advance what their payment method is.
It is practically impossible to exchange local currency outside the Falkland Islands, so do it before you leave.
When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in Montevideo, and vice versa. The reason is that the city is located south of the equator.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30°C in the summer months are common.
Winters there can be deceptively cold: the thermometer rarely drops below zero, but due to the wind combined with humidity, the temperature feels lower than it actually is.
The level of precipitation almost does not change throughout the year, so there are no specific rainy or dry seasons here.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, you should not feed or disturb them — wild animals remain wild.
The park's management advises keeping a distance of at least 100 yards (meters) from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (meters) from other wild animals!
Bison, elk, horned animals, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking, regardless of how docile they may seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year due to lack of proper distance. Do not approach closely, as these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous.
Keep in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so do not carry or prepare food with a strong aroma, and maintain cleanliness in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city, which has a population of just under 40,000 people, is located on the island of Upolu.

In 1889, the harbor became the site of the infamously known naval confrontation when seven German, American, and British ships refused to leave the harbor.
Except for one British cruiser, all other ships sank. As a result, nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
The peaceful assembly in the city, which took place during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, ended with the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to the fact that there are harbors on both sides of Auckland, there are a large number of beaches here. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches are located near North Harbour. They stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south along the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
Almost all the beaches here are sandy, it is a safe place for swimming, and most have shade from the trees halfway.
In the elite suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers (a central area of Auckland) in the Waitematā Harbour are the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These are other times crowded beaches for families with many shops. Swimming here is safe.

Local tap water is completely safe and suitable for drinking. However, if you have any concerns, finding bottled water is not a problem.
The idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. Espresso is a small portion of black coffee, cappuccino is rich with cream, not foam, and tea is brewed without milk.
Hot chocolate is really the same as in Belgium. The fruit juices cost quite a lot, but the taste is excellent.
Reef trips take place all year round and in large numbers, but injuries and traumas from any of the mentioned causes occur rarely.
Nevertheless, we advise to follow the authorities' recommendations, comply with all requirements, and pay close attention to warnings about the necessity of adhering to safety rules.
Box jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and around river estuaries north of the settlement of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be seen outside of this period.
There are indeed sharks here, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks avoid people and thus swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles primarily live not in the ocean, but in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows the traveler not to worry, as there will be a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often deal with specific hotels. However, you may be able to book other accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Usually, travel agents offer service packages that include breakfast, airport transfer, and back, or even combined packages with airfare and hotel accommodation.
Additionally, if you need time to think over the offer or obtain other documents (such as a visa) necessary to reach your destination, the travel agent can hold your reservation.
It is recommended to send your proposals for changes of conditions or requests to the travel agent, rather than directly to the hotel.
The vast majority of music festival attendees choose to stay at the event site, and, according to most attendees, this is an extremely important experience.
You will need to arrive early if you want to find a spot in the campsite near the music venue.
Remember that even when performances on the main stages are over, there may still be festival sections where music will play well past midnight.
At some festivals, families with small children can use special campsites.
We advise checking the location of your cabin when crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter — passing through the ice can be accompanied by terrifying noise and cracking, which can be particularly disturbing for people with heightened sensory sensitivity.
The cruise program to Saint Petersburg includes spending time in the city. Passengers on these cruises do not need visas (see terms and conditions).
Usually, a casino makes a lot of effort to ensure that guests spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible. For this reason, casinos lack windows and clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment programs. All this is done to keep guests in a good mood and make them not want to leave the casino.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered on the house. However, all great players know the importance of staying sober, because intoxication impedes good thinking.
Snow, ice, and negative temperatures are all factors that must be considered by anyone planning to visit northern latitudes or cross mountain passes.
The coefficient of adhesion on snowy and icy roads is low, so you cannot drive as if there is just asphalt under the wheels.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you may become stuck.
Additionally, visibility can be limited due to snowfall or blizzards, or the icing or condensation of moisture on car windows.
At the same time, snowy weather and icing are common occurrences in many countries, and traffic there does not stop throughout the year.
The most popular tourist attraction in Africa is probably safari, for many tourists it is the most interesting moment.
In general usage, the term "safari" means a land journey, specifically across the savannah, where one can see the beautiful wild African environment.
As a rule, certain animals, among which are giraffes and elephants, approach closely to cars, and good visibility can be guaranteed even by standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are better observed with binoculars, as they can sometimes be very cautious.
A hike that takes several hours or maybe a few days is called a walking safari. It is also known as a "bushwalk," "hiking safari," or "footing."
From August 24 to September 5, 2021, the Paralympic Games will be held. Certain competitions will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympic Games twice — the first time they were held here was in 1964.
The situation may become complicated if you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before it became known about the postponement.
The cancellation policy may vary, but as of the end of March, the cancellation policy due to the coronavirus epidemic generally does not cover July 2020, when the Olympics are supposed to take place.
It is estimated that the cost of tickets for most events will range from 2500 to 130,000 yen, with the cost of standard tickets being around 7000 yen.
If you iron damp clothes, they will dry faster. Many hotels offer an ironing board and iron for rent, even if they are not in the room.
You can try using a hairdryer if you don't have an iron on hand or don't want to wear ironed socks.
Try not to overheat the fabric (as it may shrink or even, in extreme cases, burn).
Water can be purified using various methods, and against specific threats, some are more effective.
In some places, boiling water may take only one minute, while in others, it requires several minutes.
Filters have varying effectiveness, so if you have any doubts, it is worth considering the purchase of bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter pests of animal origin that are not typical for their native region.
Pests are capable of causing irritation (and in the worst cases, even allergic reactions), spreading toxic substances and infections, as well as spoiling food.
Usually, infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person are not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods at certain places that are not subject to taxes and excise duties.
Tourists traveling to countries where taxes are very high can often save a considerable amount, especially on goods such as tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway are on the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, where the road often goes through remote areas.
If you lack extensive experience driving on country roads, always remain vigilant: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes, and unexpected turns here.
The existing speed limits here are noticeably lower than the preceding and following sections—usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is very important to strictly adhere to them.
Interesting fact: the mobile signal here is much stronger than along many other stretches of road, say, near the "Pennsylvania Wilds".
The pastry in Germany is quite good, and in Bavaria, as in its southern neighbor Austria, it is quite hearty and varied.
Fruit-based pastries, which include apples year-round and additionally cherries and plums in the summer, are widely popular.
Hazelnuts, almonds, and other forest nuts can be found in many types of German pastries. Strong coffee is often a good partner for popular cakes.
If you are looking for a small but calorie-rich pastry, try the one that, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from meat or vegetables, seasoned with herbs and spices.
There are two types of bark. It can be dry or wet. It all depends on how much moisture it contains.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is typically added to curry, while in Southern India and some other coastal areas, they simply use coconut milk.
Indonesian food is cooked on 17,000 islands. It should be noted here that Indonesian food is a general term that brings together a wide range of regional cuisines of the entire country.
However, in the absence of additional clarifications, the mentioned term most often refers to dishes that originate from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now Javanese cuisine dishes can be tasted throughout the entire archipelago. It features a wide variety of simple spicy dishes. Most often, you can find seasonings and aromatic additives loved by the Javanese — peanuts, red hot chili peppers, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups hang down from both sides of the saddle and serve as supports for the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with more stability, but safety issues may arise because the rider's feet can get caught.
If a rider falls off a horse, their foot can get caught in the stirrup. In this case, if the horse gets scared and starts to run away, it may drag the rider along. To minimize this risk, certain safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear special shoes with heels and soft, rather narrow soles.
In addition, for some saddles, especially English ones, protective loops are provided. When a rider pulls back on the stirrup leather during a fall, the protective loops allow him to fall from the saddle.
In the Cachama Valley, the main destination in Chile for mountain climbing enthusiasts, known as the Yosemite of South America, there is a large number of big granite rocks and obstacles.
From the mountain peaks, breathtaking views unfold. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly charting new routes amidst the endless maze of rocks.
Alpine skiing sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. They involve descending a snow-covered surface on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
For many enthusiasts, skiing is the main activity they engage in while traveling, and they are sometimes called "skiing enthusiasts." They may spend their entire vacation skiing in a particular place.
People have been skiing since ancient times — rock paintings depicting skiers date back to approximately 5000 BC.
Somewhere in the 17th century, the history of alpine skiing as a sport began, and in 1861, the Norwegians had already opened the first sports and wellness ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: this is what skiing in remote areas, ski trips, or ski hikes are called.
It is close to ski touring in the alpine style or mountaineering, but usually does not include them. The latter are done on steep sections of terrain and require much stiffer skis and footwear.
Compare the ski trail with a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can travel a little further than if you were walking. However, achieving the same speed as when skiing on a groomed trail without a heavy backpack will be very rare for you.
Europe is a relatively small continent. Nevertheless, it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means tourists and travelers have to repeatedly go through passport control and submit visa applications.
At the same time, the Schengen Area functions as a single country in this regard.
You usually have the opportunity to cross borders without going through passport control points again while you are in this zone.
Similarly, if you already have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each participating country of the Schengen zone separately, which saves time, money, and simplifies the documentation procedure.
There is no universal definition upon which manufactured items are classified as antiquities. Some tax authorities define goods as antiques if they were made over 100 years ago.
The term "antique" has certain geographical differences. For instance, in North America, the age required for an item to be considered antique is less than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be called antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of subsistence for the Sámi, and the trading culture accompanying it is significant for people in other professions.
However, not all Sámi traditionally engaged in large-scale reindeer herding. Many lived from fishing, hunting, or similar activities, and reindeer were mainly used as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi have modern professions. An important source of income in Lapland, where the Sámi live, is tourism.
Despite its wide prevalence, especially among other peoples, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and a mistaken image of the Romani people.
If a warning about danger or undesirability of traveling to the country you plan to visit is issued, it may affect the conditions of medical insurance for the duration of the trip or trip cancellation insurance.

Yes, for example, compared to Europeans or Arabs, U.S. citizens may encounter different situations while in the Middle East.
Recommendations and danger warnings are just a brief summary of the country's political circumstances.
They often express general, superficial, and simplified views, especially when compared to more detailed information that can be obtained from other sources.
Extreme meteorological conditions are a general term for describing hazardous weather phenomena that can cause harm, disrupt public life, or lead to human casualties.
The weather can turn out to be harsh in any part of the world. Depending on the geographical location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions, natural disasters can take various forms.
Among the various forms and consequences of extreme weather conditions are not only strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires, but also tornadoes, cyclones, thunderstorms, and waterspouts.
Blizzards, snowstorms, ice, and dust storms are all regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travelers are strongly advised to be informed about any potentially severe weather conditions in their region, as this will affect planned trips.
Anyone planning to visit a country where hostilities may be occurring should undergo appropriate professional training.
"As a result of an Internet search query for 'Aggressive Environment Course,' you might receive the address of some local firm."

As a rule, such a course lasts from 2 to 5 days, and its program includes role-playing games, numerous first aid training sessions, as well as weapons handling.
There are many books and magazines dedicated to wilderness survival, but there are very few publications dedicated to war zones.
Tourists who are planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must have the appropriate documents for returning to their homeland.
In different countries, governments are ready to varying degrees to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or to make changes to documents in accordance with the desired name and gender.
Foreign governments are ready to implement these documents to a very different extent.
Moreover, after September 11, 2001, inspections at checkpoints became much more intrusive.
It is unlikely that transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery will be able to go through the scanner without compromising their dignity and right to privacy.
A rip current, which is often observed on a reef or in a similar place, is the backflow from waves retreating from the beach.
The reverse flow is concentrated in several areas with great depth, which is related to the underwater topology, and there it is possible for a fast current to form to a great depth.
The cause of most fatalities is fatigue, when people try to swim back to shore against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it will not be difficult at all to swim back.
Try to head where you won't end up going with the flow again. Also, if your skills allow or if you've been noticed, you can stay in place and wait for rescue.
Due to a shorter honeymoon phase, the shock of returning home may occur earlier than culture shock. It can be more serious and have a longer duration.
Travelers who did not have trouble adapting to a new culture may find it very difficult to readapt to the culture of their homeland.
People returning to their homeland after living abroad for a certain extended period have already adapted to the culture of the new country. They have lost some of their habits that were once acquired in their native culture.
Probably, when you first visited a foreign country, people were patient and compassionate because they knew that travelers need time to adapt.
Many do not expect at all that understanding and patience are also needed for those travelers who are returning to their homeland.
One of the events that might interest your children more than anything else is the sound and light show held around the pyramids.
Darkness and silence envelop the pyramids before the start of the show.
Usually, you can always hear the voices of tourists and traders here. The history of light and sound is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx serves as decoration and functions as the narrator of a long story.
Pyramids serve as a screen for the plots of stories, and different pyramids are illuminated from time to time.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819. The largest number of bases are located here. In 2020, sixteen of them were still operational.
The archipelago separates the peninsula by a distance of 120 km to the north. The largest island is called King George, and it hosts the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, one can note Livingston and Deception Islands, where a picturesque natural harbor was formed in the crater of an active volcano.
Ellsworth Land, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is located south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau. Then they arise again from it, forming the Ellsworth mountain range, which is 360 km long. The Minnesota Glacier cuts it in half.
The highest mountain massif in Antarctica, Vinson, is located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range. The highest peak in it is Mount Vinson, which reaches 4,892 meters.
A satellite phone may be your only option when you are in a remote area where mobile communication does not work.
Satellite phones usually do not replace mobile phones because, to make a call from them, one needs to be outside and have a direct line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used by shipping companies. Including on pleasure boats and expeditions that require data transmission and voice communication services.
More details about subscribing to this service can be obtained from the local telephone service provider.
An option to combine study with travel is gaining increasing popularity among those planning an academic break.
This option is particularly popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take an academic break before entering university without harming their knowledge.
In fact, in many cases, a year of study abroad can increase your chances of getting into a university or college in your own country.
Education in these educational programs is usually paid.
Finland is one of the best places for rowing or boating. In addition, the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islets located both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You can do without a yacht on lakes and archipelagos.
Despite the fact that the largest lakes and coastal archipelagos are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks can provide completely different experiences.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime. According to statistics, there is one boat for every seven or eight people here.
Similar can be seen in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but nowhere else (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure stands at a ratio of one to forty).
For the most memorable Baltic cruises, an extended stop in Russia's St. Petersburg is typical.
This means that over the course of several full days, you have the opportunity to walk around the historic part of the city, returning to the ship for the night.
You will not need a separate visa if you are going ashore only on ship excursions (information as of 2009).
Some cruises in their brochures offer to visit the German Berlin. However, if you look at the map, you can see that Berlin is far from the sea. Furthermore, the cost of the cruise does not include visiting the city.
For people of any age and background, flying in an airplane can be a frightening experience, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic incident.
Do not be ashamed of it: it is the same kind of fear as other personal fears or aversions to certain things that many people experience.
Understanding how planes are constructed and what happens during a flight may help some people overcome the fear that arises from the fear of the unknown or loss of control.
Courier services are well paid for the fast delivery of items. In many cases, when delivering business documentation, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs, time is of great importance.
Large companies have their own airplanes on some routes; however, when it comes to other routes and not-so-large firms, there was a problem.
If the items were dispatched via air transport, then on some routes unloading and customs clearance might have taken several days.
Sending registered luggage was the only way to get the cargo faster. Airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come into play.
The obvious way to end up in first or business class is to shell out a huge amount of money for such a privilege (or even better, have the company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: practice shows that compared to regular economy class, you may pay four times as much for business class and more than eleven times for first class!
Essentially, there is no point in looking for discounts on tickets for direct flights from A to B in first or business class.
Airlines are well aware of the existence of a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the maximum price for the privilege of quickly and comfortably reaching their destination. Therefore, they charge the corresponding fee.
The capital of Moldova is the city of Chisinau. The local population speaks Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a country where several nationalities reside and where an ethnic conflict took place.
As a result of this conflict in 1994, a self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic was established in the eastern part of Moldova. It has its own government and currency, but no country that is a member of the EU recognizes it.
Economic ties between the two aforementioned parts of Moldova were restored, despite the political negotiations not being successful.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodoxy.
Among the cities of Turkey, Izmir ranks third in size. Its population is about 3.7 million people. It is a very good transport hub and the second largest port after Istanbul.
Smyrna, an ancient city, is now a modern, developed, and active trade center, situated by a vast bay amidst mountains.
Although the atmosphere of the city is more akin to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey, here wide boulevards, glass facades of buildings, and modern shopping centers coexist with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, as well as old mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik, you can visit a church that has an unusual octagonal shape. In addition, from here there is a picturesque view of the neighboring island of Eysturoy.
Over some of the graves in the churchyard, noticeable marble sculptures of doves are installed.
It is worth taking a half-hour walk around this interesting and unusual village to see its attractions.
In the north, near it, lies the romantic and captivating city of Sintra, which became famous among residents of other countries after Lord Byron brilliantly described its grandeur.
Bus route number 403 operated by the company "Scoturb" makes regular trips to Sintra. It has a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Additionally, we recommend visiting the sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a Holy place), which is world-famous for the repeated sightings of the apparition of the Virgin Mary.
Remember that you are essentially at the site of mass graves, the significance of which for a large part of the world's population is simply indescribable in words.
And even today, quite a few men and women are still alive who had to survive here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or who worked here — both Jews and people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the seriousness and respect it deserves. It is not appropriate to joke here about Nazis or the Holocaust.
Do not damage this place — do not write or draw graffiti anywhere.
In Barcelona, there are two official languages — Spanish and Catalan. Approximately half of the residents prefer Catalan — most understand it. And almost everyone speaks Spanish.
At the same time, Catalan is used on most signs, as it is the official language according to the legislation.
However, in public transport and other places, the Spanish language is also widely used.
Announcements in the metro are made exclusively in the Catalan language, but notifications about sudden service disruptions are made through an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Japanese, and Arabic.
The residents of Paris are often called rude, egocentric, and arrogant.
Although it is most often just a mistaken stereotype, still, when in Paris, it is better to demonstrate your best behavior and be bien élevé (a well-mannered person). Thanks to this, you will hardly have any problems navigating the city.
If you show a little kindness, the sharp behavior of Parisians will quickly disappear.
A large area of Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by forest. Here, you can predominantly find beech, Canadian spruce, and various other coniferous trees. There is also a mix of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
Thanks to the wide range of microclimates, diverse soil types, and different elevations above sea level, a multitude of plant communities can be found here.
In addition, a wide variety of bird and animal species live in this area.
Besides various common species, this place is inhabited by such rare animals as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie.
Women visiting monasteries must wear skirts that cover their knees. Additionally, their shoulders must also be covered.
In almost all monasteries, women who weren't aware of these requirements are indeed offered headscarves. However, if you bring your own, especially if it's in bright colors, the monks or nuns at the entrance will be very pleased.
A similar requirement applies to men as well—they must wear trousers below the knees.
They can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each guest, so you might feel uncomfortable in such skirts. Men are offered a one-size-fits-all!
As with the cuisines of many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is characterized by dishes made from vegetables, bread, and meat (mainly pork). In addition, olive oil is added to all dishes.
A simple and popular dish, especially in the summer, is called "Pa-amb-Oli." It consists of bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any seasonings that are on hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Even when they are in the middle of a sentence, all nouns, as well as the pronoun Sie (meaning "You"), begin with a capital letter.
With the help of this method, it is always possible to distinguish verbs from nouns that denote objects.
Perhaps this also simplifies reading but somewhat complicates writing because it's necessary to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in the substantive form.
Most words in Italian are pronounced exactly as they are written, so the pronunciation here can hardly be called difficult.
It is necessary to pay special attention to the letters "c" and "g" because their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
The consonants "r" and "rr" need to be pronounced differently: "caro" is translated as "dear" while "carro" means "carriage."
Persian has a relatively simple and predominantly linear grammar.
Therefore, after studying this grammar textbook, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
There is no doubt that knowledge of any Romance language makes learning Portuguese much easier.
However, people who are able to speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that the Portuguese language is similar to it and therefore does not require separate study.
As of today, pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete and function as museums or educational centers.
Such observatories were usually located in cities or on university grounds, where they were easier to reach than modern observatories. The reason is simple — nowadays, light pollution poses a much bigger problem than it did in the past.
The main part of research telescopes nowadays represents grandiose objects of gigantic size, which are usually located in peripheral areas with optimal atmospheric conditions.
"Hanami," which means the viewing of cherry blossoms, became part of Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
China is considered the homeland of this concept, where plum blossoms were favored.
The first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the Emperor of Japan only for himself and other court aristocrats.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so do not be tempted to pluck "just one" specimen.
If you start collecting "specimens" when visiting a properly maintained official garden, you will also be expelled without any discussion.
Overall, Singapore is a safe place to stay and move around, and you can buy almost anything here after arriving.
However, if you found yourself just a few degrees north of the equator, in the "high tropics," you would have to deal with both the heat (all the time) and the bright sun (when the sky is clear, much less often).
To the north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives, several buses also go.
You should make sure that the bus you intend to take is indeed going to Hebron, and that its route does not end in the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
There are interesting opportunities for recreation on the inland waterways.
You can, for example, go on a cruise along the Danube to see some interesting places, visit castles in the Loire or Rhine river valleys, or take a boat ride along the Erie Canal.
For popular hiking and cycling trails, they also determine the routes.
In Christianity, the holiday celebrated as the birthday of Jesus is called Christmas (or the Nativity). It is one of the most important holidays for believers.
Many customs typical of this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians in all countries of the world.
On Easter night, there is a tradition not to sleep but to stay somewhere in the open to witness the sunrise.
In Christianity, there are, of course, certain theological explanations for this tradition, but it may simply represent a ritual of fertility and the arrival of spring.
The Easter service is usually conducted by more traditional churches on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and parishioners often begin the celebrations at midnight, marking the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally reached the islands either swam or flew there.
The main pasture animal in the Galapagos has become the giant tortoise. This happened because mammals could not migrate due to the great distance between the island and the continent.
Many mammals have appeared in the Galapagos since the arrival of humans there, including goats, horses, cows, cats, dogs, and rats.
You will be able to experience what a polar night is like if you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic in winter. During this time, the sun does not rise above the horizon at all.
This way you can admire the polar lights, because the sky will be almost continuously dark.
Additionally, you will have the opportunity to enjoy the stars, considering that these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not an issue.
Japanese work culture differs from what residents of Western countries are accustomed to. It is more hierarchical and formal.
Business attire typically consists of suits, and colleagues address each other by last names or job titles.
The value of harmonious working relationships cannot be overestimated. The efforts of the entire group, rather than individual achievements, are prioritized for them.
Often, the decisions of employees must be approved by their superiors. They are expected to execute the orders of higher management without question.
