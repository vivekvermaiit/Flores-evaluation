In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, which means that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other drugs against it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Board and agrees with the utmost necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that fossils usually do not, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists said that animal feathers are chestnut brown on the top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provided insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other characteristics of feathers, like barbs and barbules, researchers think that the rachis is likely a more recent evolutionary feature compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the example shows that this is the feather of an adult dinosaur and not the inner and thin feathers of a chick.
Researchers suggested that, even though it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chick.

They discovered that the Sun operates according to the basic principles similar to those of other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system was found to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used simultaneously to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversals.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but the program was written to encourage observations made regarding the Sagittarius galaxy.
The group is determining the possible effect of the colossal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just like how the moon's pull on the Earth causes the tides to rise and fall, the Milky Way similarly exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have also concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter affects similar matter.
According to this theory, a large portion of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in a kind of limbo around a galaxy and is made up of countless small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, a region located in South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new strain is "extremely concerning and alarming due to the high percentage of fatalities."
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients might have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, and no fewer than two are healthcare workers in the hospital.

"Their warm demeanor is not as constant as large caves on Earth that often maintain a relatively unchanging temperature, but it is very similar to them as they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally considered a low-tech experience: voters separate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the list of qualified voters.
The French election law codifies the processes rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and to ensure that no envelopes are added except for those that are to be counted and authorized voters.
The candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process. At night, the votes are counted by volunteers under intense supervision, following specific procedures.

Aside from the competition last Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two individual races in the Championship.
His first was the Slalom, where he got a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had similar results in that race.
Her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the sit-down women's group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place winner, an Austrian named Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place winner, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the group of women sitting failed to finish their race, and 45 out of 117 skiers failed to place in the Giant Slalom race.
The Police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Aray said, "We have arrested the five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when it was hit by the car, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
The street where the collision happened was temporarily closed while members of the emergency team extricated the driver from the red Audi TT car.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred again to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, charged with the murder of her child.
He is detained while awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may have been tainted because his photo has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the administration of justice in Scotland is different, and the courts have come to view that the publication of photographs has the potential to be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists indeed seem to be walking on the edge of disaster when publishing photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which oversees all prosecutions, indicated to reporters that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to what has been revealed, refers to the boundary dispute, wherein Palestine desires it based on the borders before the Middle East War in 1967.
Other topics are expected to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting to maintain a military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test will be carefully supervised by the rangers, as the test is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were gathered under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters' Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS Park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
The new Provisional Council (CEP), composed of nine members, was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP as part of preparations to lead the country to new elections.
The commission is Martelly's response to the widespread anti-administration protests that began in October.
Protests that were sometimes violent were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to have taken place as far back as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating from defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that they have long been aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at local time 07:19 a.m. (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The office for emergency management of the Northern Marianas said that no damages have been reported in the country.
Similarly, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists using his M16 rifle.
Many hostages were rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Eventually, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the field of medicine.
She studied as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm labor during his free time.
His research shows that when a hormone is administered, it can accelerate the maturation of a baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators have retrieved two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by fellow fighters like him.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Truly unique like her. A brave woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels expressed that "Luna was as unique as I am... perhaps even more so... I love her and I'm excited for her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believes Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed hold this view, desiring that Queen Elizabeth II be the last queen of Australia.
At the opposite ends of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The swimmer who won a gold medal at the Olympics is set to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, the strength of her body is being questioned.
They cannot take the drugs needed to relieve the pain they feel because it is prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Some people verified the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of delivering water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists wish to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is suspected that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology in contrast to the old land-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport is provided and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available in the area.
Fears of a transportation shortage have raised the possibility that the match might be forced to be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorean Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species have undergone evolution in just two generations, even though this process was believed to take longer, due to the breeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all types of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn out into thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made extremely thin, so it was once used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen atoms consist of just one proton separated from its electron, and the separated ion of hydrogen is commonly referred to as a proton.
Mix the two dry powders together in a circular motion, and then, using clean wet hands, squeeze them until they form a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing an odd sensation and forming a skin-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro once had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
The remains of sewer systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space will receive the call and almost immediately send it back down.
The satellite in space is launched using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes distortion of some of our light and what we see.
A large rocket with a height of 100 feet is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel changed the world in remarkable ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is provide easier and faster transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Following them are many more cats of perfect size that devour prey aptly sized, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including escaped pet cats) that are eating increasingly more small prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is having the appropriate task or a special task to avoid competition among each cat.
Lions are the friendliest of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Women often have close relationships with each other, like one big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also extremely fierce with their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger is capable of climbing (though not very well), swimming, leaping long distances, and pulling five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not like the strength of a lion's roar, but more like a statement of abrupt, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot seeks are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt the animals they prey on by sniffing and smelling where they are on the ground.
They can clearly see in the dark through night vision, and they can also move stealthily. Ocelots catch their prey by adapting to their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of living things (a small population) gets isolated from the main population they came from (such as if they go to a mountainous area or to a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a place that's different from where they originated.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become stronger competitors than they previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, their appearance starts to differ more and more from another population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be classified as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which is breathed in by people, and they take in the carbon dioxide exhaled by people (that is, breathed out).
Plants make their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and craft our clothes from plants. Almost all of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasauruses.
Its long jaws have 70 sharp teeth, including an extra row at the top of its mouth, meaning that nothing can escape anyone who encounters it.
We are not certain, but it may have become fork-tongued. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would not prevail against it.
Although we are familiar with much of their food, the Romans also had their astonishing or extraordinary dishes prepared for feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and the women eat sitting on chairs, wealthy men like to have feasts together where they will sit reclining while eating.
The foods of Ancient Rome may not have included the foods that went to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple recognized as the house of the god.
The people will bring offerings for the gods and the priests will try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests may enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, are built to be part of the temples.
The peak of the tower is a unique sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house did not become very important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women cook in the yard; the stores are merely open counters facing the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
There are no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the value of wood is very high.
Few settled in Greenland. In the long sagas of the Norse, it is said that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing murder, and while traveling towards the west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever he discovered, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', many differences exist among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, and is upside-down.
Although no one can be certain who its author is, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
That's why, perhaps the short note was placed to serve only as a marker.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated Northern France, but its southern part was still not free.
It was under the control of the French "Vichy". These were people from France who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and became accomplices of the occupiers rather than their enemies.
On August 15, 1940, the allies launched an attack on southern France, the assault was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a unified culture shared by a very large group of people who live and support each other, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil, related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it also somehow implies the scale of society.
City-states are the beginnings of countries. Civilizational culture indicates the transfer of knowledge across many generations, a lasting imprint of culture and equitable dissemination.
Secondary cultures often vanish without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as deserving civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress as its unique component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress has no power to impose taxes, and, because there is no national executive or judiciary, it relies on the state authorities, who often do not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
It also does not have the power to nullify tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles require unanimous consent from all states before they can be amended, and the states did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The national football team of Italy, as well as the national football team of Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and became champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most well-known in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
The country of Japan holds nearly 7,000 islands (with the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Because of Japan's group of islands, Japan is often called an "archipelago" due to its geographical location.
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and provided employment for Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three primary structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photography in the world for still images is 35 mm, which became the primary film size at the end of the analog film era.
This is still being done today, but what is more important is that the image sensor formats of digital cameras have inherited its aspect ratio.
The 35 mm format is actually, seemingly confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats, for example) are approximately or equivalent to this aspect ratio.
The often-abused and frequently-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates excitement while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
This states that the most effective place for the main subject is usually at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the states of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's funds are there for that specific purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
Not long after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies for the military and civilians, although this blockade violated the commonly accepted international law organized as a system through several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined the international waters to prevent the entry of any ships into the entire section of the ocean, posing a risk even to neutral ships.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and countries was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during the time of World War I, the nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods; each era of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty was also the unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these is the period of the Three Kingdoms, which occurred over 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
During these times, a fierce war occurred between many nobles who were fighting to ascend to the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people perishing while vying for the highest position in the opulent palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise, after the Revolution, jobs opened up to all male applicants, giving the most ambitious and successful the opportunity to succeed.
This can also be said about the military because instead of the ranks of the army being based on class, they are now based on proficiency in warfare.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad developed a deep interest in things beyond this worldly life. He often went to the cave known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for his meditations.
The very cave, which has survived through the ages, provides a very clear picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Situated at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not really easy to find even when someone knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it is truly isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Only a tiny part of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the large pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains many pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were made to honor the wives of Khufu and family members.
The "upward slash" mark looks like a V and the "downward slash" mark is similar to a staple or a square without the bottom part.
Upwards means you should start at the end and push the plane, and downwards means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the plane) and pull the plane.
The upward slide usually creates a softer sound, while the downward slide is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to write your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed markings for the movement of the sharpener are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a throng of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The King and Queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage wide because of the thronging crowd.
At one point, a member of the group waved the head of the leader of the king's guards who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of the war waged by imperialist United States in its conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to fund a large portion of the expenses and the interest on the bonds that were floated in the name of the Philippine government through the banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the excess profits that come from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will form the primary benefit of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must learn the context that led to the formation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, the stage of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas implemented, from the push of technology or the extreme technological necessity to the precise understanding that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the advancement of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political power, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than conditioned by society.
For example, it can be said that the car drives the construction of roads.
However, the national network of roads will not be a profitable business if only for a few vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which has led to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a significant element of cultural determinism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerge, and these, as they align with the place of society, are even better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the way Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as a center of luxury began in 400 A.D. and ended around 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century due to the fact that Christian invaders or Crusaders returned bearing gifts like silks and spices that were more valued than what the Byzantine market could offer.
This is the period when the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at the peak of its popularity during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow channels of communication, Western modes may be left behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the later part of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest advancements during that time, as a result of the crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the practice of growing enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that utilizes saved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other arguably simple methods to increase yield.
According to history, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite people with similar mindsets who feel marginalized by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture usually express their membership through the unique and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, customs, and slang language.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to consider some of the undesirable conditions of children who are not taught good manners by adults as they grow up, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wild" or feral. Some feral children have previously been confined by people (often their own parents); in other cases, this abandonment of the child is due to the parents rejecting the child with severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Children who have limited interaction with people from an early age may have first experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the forest by themselves.
When fully raised by animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) almost similar to those shown by the caregiving animal, such as fear or aloofness towards humans.
Although project-based learning should simplify and make learning interesting, the structuring of support does more than that.
Providing components for study or scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that supports individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The components (scaffolds) can be both seemingly real (virtual) and actual. This means that a teacher is a form of scaffold as well as Clippy from Microsoft Office.
The virtual support frameworks are integrated into the software and aim to ask, suggest, and explain methods that may have been difficult for the student to tackle alone.
Children are placed in an orphanage for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they are there.
We consider orphanages to be safe places for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, continuous education, and reliable healthcare.
The orphanage should provide all the needs that were not met in the previous home where they were taken from.
The Internet has united the elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet pave the way for additional forms regarding the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "study" and "social interaction" are suggested as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated listeners' reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in interpreting minute expressions, facial movements that occur in just a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that a person can determine if someone is lying by correctly interpreting their small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He also suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior might be the same in animals like domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genetic diversity: covert and overt.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of actual usable variations.
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between two pools in each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from plant sources.
Aside from this, failing to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest resources to obtain from plants would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but it's difficult for primates like us to digest them unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide a lot of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Considering all things, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way somewhat similar to how monkeys on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your usual sleep period and going back to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring back your awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself habitually changing the time on your alarm, you may want to place it on the other side of your room, so that you'll be forced to get up from your bed to turn it off.
Some other options based on biological rhythms require drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleeping, which prompts one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
If the tension is lower, the force of life that exists will be more positive. Every person has the potential to find complete peace and tranquility.
Each person can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is extended by the path of love of the Mahayana and the numerous techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all lovers.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy of Kundalini (the energy of consciousness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Deities. By mentally visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany became the enemy of all during World War 2, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, the conflicts in systems, processes, and culture became the cause of the disagreement among the countries.
Within two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become adversaries and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will truly be fought by proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was shattered, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, as more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the delivery of products is the best method of all for the transfer of a large number of people and products across oceans.
The traditional role of naval forces is to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and products, while simultaneously hindering your enemy's ability to move their people and products.
One of the latest remarkable examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII (World War II). The Americans were trying to transport men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had happened to fail, it is likely that Germany would have already conquered Britain, just as it had done in much of mainland Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated almost 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hide.
Pet goats are often placed in herds that roam in the mountains or other pastures, usually cared for by shepherds who are often children or young people, similar to more well-known shepherds. The method of caring for the herd is still used today.
Wagon tracks were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the carts are made up of aligned wooden planks, this allows the horses to pull them faster and haul larger loads than on somewhat rougher roads.
The sleepers were used early on to keep the rails fixed. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a narrow strip of steel on top.
This activity became widespread, but the steel caused the wooden wheels of the carriages to wear down more.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking, where people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
The ones before them, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is customary.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two feet as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living in ways that are less harmful to our environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, then we must look for the root of the problems and we must stop their operation.
It is clear enough that the world has significantly changed because of the advancements in human science and technology, and the problems have become heavier due to overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of people.
After it was ratified by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon at the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not believe that they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still so many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk using their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all currently used computers are based on processing information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e.g., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, when used in computing terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally sufficient, which is why immediate examination might not be conducted.
The clearest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or poisonous chemicals in the house.
Check the label for specific instructions for first aid for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient phenomenon of having complete knowledge about bedbugs, which are insects well-adapted to infest humans.
Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs both depend for a long time on their parents after they are born, adapted to living in the nest or burrow of their host.
Across the entire United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is considered the primary neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that it is not good for them or for the welfare of their child to raise a baby.
The couple may decide to put their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary aim of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
This is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views are accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself distanced from its origins in Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in body structure and behavior are highly dependent on the internal processes within their bodies and are produced through the biological clock.
The seasonal rhythms, which are not just responses to external seasonal cues, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue the period of free-running cycling even without external cues.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase is one of the leading suggestions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are cells for sexual reproduction.
Only mutations in the germ cell line can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the plants and animals in the forest.
Examples of actual activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the environment.
One example is visiting, taking pictures, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every day, people leave the small towns of the country by car to get to their workplaces, passing by others whose workplace is the place they came from.
In the dynamic flow of this transportation, all people in one way or another are connected to, and support, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Current science suggests that this extensive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from a stable state that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems have these kinds of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are the transportation engineers really incapable? Or is there something else more important going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Sadly, analyzing the flow of traffic is not easy because driver behavior cannot be estimated with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers have a tendency to behave within an unchanging scope; hence, the flow of traffic also remains constant and can be estimated using mathematics.
To better describe the flow of traffic, relationships were established among the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and management of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them conquer their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings alongside their bodies.
It gives them a broader range of small areas to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems significant, because it doesn't feel like the world is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
The entire 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers on the planet to the seas comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids using stone did not cease until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical prowess of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the main chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in nature in their native form and are easily mined using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited that everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
The four states of matter are more like this (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though he also supposed that these become new things to form what we see.
Alloys are typically mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table and some of them are also metals (such as calcium and potassium) and can be mixed with other metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys with a mixture of small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is composed of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, with trillions of them able to fit within the dot at the end of this sentence.
Consequently, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was introduced.
Sadly, as new ways of writing emerged, the pencil was placed in a lower status and use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, which will never need to be sharpened.
One can only know what might happen to the keyboard when something newer arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy needs to combine the nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It might be like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Thus, the splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms are those with an imbalance in the number of protons and neutrons, which means they may become unstable if there are few or no matching numbers of protons and neutrons.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is almost 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner beneath the maria and thicker beneath the highlands.
There might be more maria in the visible part of the world because the earth's crust is thinner. It's easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what can motivate people or capture their attention.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they embrace as they age.
These theories are about what drives some people to desire what they do and what things in their environment push them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make decisions that many will not like, to discipline, to assess performance, to delegate responsibilities, and to hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything the group is already doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is truly responsible for the success and failure of the group.
This behavior often results in misunderstandings between leaders and other group members.
Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the virtual team often serve as the point of contact for their respective physical group.
Often, they have more autonomy than members of the usual group because their teams can meet according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the team that manages where each member reports. The invisible team assigns the standards to each member.
Why would an organization desire to go through the time-consuming process of developing a learning organization? One goal for the active implementation of an organization's learning concepts is innovation.
If all resources are effectively utilized throughout the active departments of an organization, creativity and intelligence will be revealed.
As a result, the organization's collaborative working process to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to better serve the needs of the customer.
Before an organization of modern ideas can be established, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and learning as an organization.
Anghel (2006) explains the Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating the ability to learn. Consequently, it limits the field of research and makes it more precise.
Scientists in their research are promoting the connection between brain pathology and behavior.
It has been known for a very long time that various types of brain damage, bitter experiences, injuries, and unusual growths affect behavior and can alter some mental functions.
The increase in new technology has allowed us to view and analyze the structures and processes of the brain that were not seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI includes the creation of machines that will automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Included in the tasks of AI are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer assessments and customer inquiries, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and human faces.
These types of things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, similar to what has been achieved in software applications for many home computers and video games.
The field trip is a significant part of every classroom. Teachers often love to take their students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution through virtual educational tours. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while seated with their class.
Sharing an educational journey virtually is also a wonderful way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the design of the website is refreshed, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often begin their blog writing experiences with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of readers.
Since students are usually the most critical viewers, the blog writer began to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "compels students to be smarter about the world around them." The necessity to cater to the audience's interest drives students to be witty and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can identify their positions in the context of others' writings as well as formulate their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada, bilingual, and features many art galleries and museums showcasing the past and present of Canada.
In the far south is the Niagara Falls, and to the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and many others highlight Ontario as what outsiders would consider to be Canadian.
The vast areas in the north are not very populated, and some are almost wilderness with no inhabitants.
For a comparison of population that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The islands in Eastern Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when discussing wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it became very important in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
Sahel is on the border of the region to the north, and to the south and west is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women traveling state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It would also help to wear a ring (as long as it doesn’t look too expensive.)
Women should realize that cultural diversity may result in what they consider harassment being commonplace, such as being followed, touched on the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether there are cultural differences or not, it is still unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan from Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and the Spanish traders, who established trading posts there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the places in all of Morocco that is not interesting to visit for shopping.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, clay utensils, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in its far east close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the town's roads, particularly in the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo along with some of the most affordable treks to track the Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can ride a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The typical (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Part of its reputation for being hard to reach, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic and faraway places.
At present, Timbuktu is an impoverished village, although its reputation is the reason for its popularity as a tourist destination, and it has an airport station.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
This is one of the main destinations visited by Henry Louis Gates in his PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is quite different from all other cities in the country because it is more Arab-styled than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a variety of wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and it is considered a pride of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like all the National Parks of South Africa, there is a fee for daily conservation and park entry.
It may also be beneficial for a person to purchase a Wild Card, which will allow entry to any selected parks in South Africa or all National Parks of South Africa.
The Island of Hong Kong is the one that gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place recognized by many tourists as the main focus.
The parade of buildings that form the skyscraper skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a shimmering bar chart, visible due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is in the dense area of reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is the place claimed by British colonizers as their own, and therefore, if you are looking for proof of the colonial past of the territory, this is the best place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world located along the coastline, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland into the provinces of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is within India's territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining hopes of the mighty forests that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans covers 3,850 km², of which one-third is submerged in water/marshlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are now 409 Royal Bengal tigers and almost 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are convenient and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it spans 378 meters in length and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs inspection stations will be completed.
The Guaraní are the most significant indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for their livelihood.
The Chaco region became home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the confrontation between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous natives.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of its indigenous characteristics and identities.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the entire world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to purchase tickets for polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the Western FIC store.
British pounds are commonly accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and often U.S. dollars are also accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what the best form of payment is.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so one should exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there during winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can have a deceptively cold chill: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild animals, however, are ferocious and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials say to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how gentle they may look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, it should be known that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa starting in 1959.
The harbor is the site of the famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in town resulted in the killing of the most important chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of it is sandy beach where it is safe to wade into the water, most of which is shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are once crowded beaches visited by families and have a beautiful array of shops along the shore. It is safe to swim in the sea.
The main local beer is 'Numero Uno', it is not a complicated beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be purchased, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia may maintain their good condition better during the journey.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. The short black is 'espresso', the cappuccino comes with a tall heap of cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Drinks made from fruit extracts are expensive yet very delicious.
There are many visits to the sea reefs happening throughout the year, and damages caused by any reason related to the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish appear near the coasts and near the river mouths from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, they can be seen outside of these times.
There are indeed sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively reside in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries located north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible for you to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to study the offer or handle other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
Any changes or requests must first go through the travel agency representative and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, arrive early to secure accommodations near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until the depths of the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with small children.
When going to the Northern Baltic during winter, check the location of the sleeping quarters, as being on ice can cause rather loud noise for those who are particularly affected.
Sea trips to Saint Petersburg require spending time in the city. Travelers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos typically make significant efforts to maximize the time and money spent by visitors. Windows and clocks are often absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment, to keep guests feeling good and to keep them at the place.
Some places offer free alcohol. However, intoxication impairs decision-making abilities, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or mountain roads should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there isn't much friction, and you cannot drive as if you are on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow to make you stop may fall in a very short period.
The ability to see falling or blowing snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows may also be limited.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is not disrupted throughout the year.
Observing animals or going on safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to an overland journey to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and ordinary equipment can provide a good viewing experience.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you are more likely to see them using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "barefoot walk") involves hiking, which may last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games already in 1964.
If you had already booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March, most cancellation policies based on coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will range from Â¥2,500 to Â¥130,000, with standard tickets costing Â¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that you can sit on, even if they are not available in the room.
If there's no iron available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric become too hot (this is the reason for the clothing to shrink, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others, more than one minute is required.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have any concerns, you should consider purchasing your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that are unfamiliar to them in their region of origin.
Pests can damage food, cause itching, or in more severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, often do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods without taxes at certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The stretch of road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through remote wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on provincial roads, stay alert: you may encounter steep, narrow, and sudden turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower compared to the previous and subsequent sections — usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and strictly adhering to them is even more important than not.
Surprisingly, however, the mobile phone service here is stronger than along many other routes, such as the Forests of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are flavorful and varied, similar to those in its neighboring country to the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, apples are cooked into pastries year-round, and cherries and plums appear during the summer season.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Famous cakes are often enjoyed with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but soft pastries, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on what they are called in the region.
A curry is a dish based on plants and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the regions of Northern India and Pakistan that are far from the sea, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because there are 17,000 island options, Indonesian food is a connective term that encompasses the vast diversity of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without additional adjectives, the term usually refers to food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a lineup of simply seasoned dishes, with predominant Javanese seasonings favoring nuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups on either side of the horse serve as support for the rider's feet.
These provide greater stability for the rider but may present safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse and one foot gets caught in the stirrup, they might be dragged if the horse runs. To reduce the risk, there are some precautions that can be taken.
First, most horse riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly the English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - the top climbing spot in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various large granite walls and slopes.
The peaks include breathtaking views from the summits. Climbers from different parts of the world continuously establish new routes amid the endless potential of its walls.
Ice sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve a rapid descent on terrain covered with ice and with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity when traveling that many people are passionate about, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered on skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old — paintings in caves depicting people skiing date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing began around the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking through skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related but usually does not use alpine touring or mountaineering styles with skis, because the latter are performed on steep terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you may be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking - but it is very rare for you to achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on a groomed trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means going through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area operates, however, in a way that is like a single country in this aspect.
While you remain in this zone, you can cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies have defined products over 100 years old as antiques.
The meaning varies according to the structure of the world, where the length of the year may be shorter in places in North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be interpreted as antiques, even if they are newer than similar products made in bulk.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding this occupation is also significant for many who have other jobs.
Even traditionally, although not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding but lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, having reindeer was mostly for working purposes.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sámi, the homeland of the Sámi.

A course usually covers all of the issues discussed here in more detail, often with practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and journals that discuss survival in the wilderness are common, but publications that address war zones are few.
Travelers planning a gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid documents for their return travel.
The readiness of governments to issue passports indicating an unspecified gender (X) or modified documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The readiness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as widely.
The inspections at security checkpoints also became more intrusive in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity fully intact.
The strong waves are the returning flow from the waves crashing on the shore, often on rocky sea or reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in some deeper parts, and a rapid water flow may form there.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back will be no harder than usual.
Strive to reach a place where you are no longer being swept away, or, depending on your abilities and if you have already been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of re-entry comes earlier than culture shock (it has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and may be more severe.
Sometimes travelers who easily adapt to a new culture find it even more difficult to readjust to their own native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you have become accustomed to the new culture and lost some of your habits from the culture of your own country.
When you first traveled to another country, it is likely that people were patient and understanding, because they know that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers on their way home.
The show of sounds and lights at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You will observe the pyramids in the dark and watch them silently before the show begins.

The Sphinx was made the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes at the pyramids are shown, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is about 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island, which is inhabited by Villa Las Estrellas.
Included among others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of the still active volcano provides a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, and then reappear to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches a height of 4892 m, Mount Vinson.
In remote areas where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone is your only option.
A satellite phone is not a common substitute for a mobile phone because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships for sea travel, including ships for the recreation of travelers, and for journeys that require data collection and communication.
The local telephone service provider is expected to provide additional information on how to connect to this service.
The increasingly popular travel option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is extremely popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before college, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually improve your chances of transitioning to higher education in your own country.
There will usually be tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, located in lakes and archipelagos along the coast.
In archipelagos and lakes, you won't always need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos near the continent's coast and the largest lakes are truly large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a unique experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but apart from these, it is truly exceptional (e.g., in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Almost all of the unique Baltic Cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you are only going down to the beach using the ship for sightseeing, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and visiting the area is not included in the cost of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people regardless of their age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced traumatic incidents.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes that many other people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Delivery companies are paid significantly for the quick delivery of items. Often, time is of the essence for business documents, goods, or parts needed for urgent repairs.
On other routes, the larger companies have their own airplanes, but on some routes and smaller companies, there is a problem.
When they send the items via aircraft, it may take several more days on another route before clearing unloading and customs procedures.
The only way for it to get through faster is by sending it as checked-in baggage. Airline regulations will not allow these to be sent without an accompanying passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class or business class is to pay a thick wad of money for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: as an estimate based on the standards, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no reason to look for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there are specific groups of travelers willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of arriving at a destination quickly and conveniently, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered due to ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the disagreement led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been reestablished despite failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

Do not ruin the reputation of the place by destroying the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, almost all the signs are written only in Catalan because it is mandated by decree as the primary official language.

Likewise, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the supply at the entrance, but that clothing is not washed after each use, so you might not be comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!

However, people who know a little Spanish might immediately conclude that it is so similar to Portuguese that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Observatories built before the modern era are often obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not yet as much of a problem as it is today when these were popular, they were often located in cities or on campuses, which were more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are very large facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea originated in China where the plum blossom was chosen as the flower.
In Japan, the first gatherings related to cherry blossoms were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants are best viewed when in their natural environment, so resist the urge to take even "just one" specimen.
If visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" would also be a reason for your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, and it is very easy to find tourist spots, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
However, due to being situated in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (constantly) and intense sunlight (when the sky is clear, though less frequently).

There are, of course, explanations in Christian theology for this tradition, but it is likely that it was a ritual of Spring and Prosperity before Christianity.
More traditional churches usually hold Easter Vigil on the night of Holy Saturday at the end of Easter weekend, when congregations often celebrate the midnight celebration to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals could not travel, so the large tortoises became the main source of animals in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the long night or polar night, which means the sun does not rise.
It offers a great opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis since the sky will be dark for approximately twenty-four hours.
Because the population is sparse in these areas, and thus light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The work culture of the Japanese is more rank-based and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Jackets (suits) are the usual business attire, and coworkers call each other by their respective last names or by their job positions.
