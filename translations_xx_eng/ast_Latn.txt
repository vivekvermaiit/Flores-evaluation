This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread; moreover, it also provides details that fossils do not have, such as the color and the three-dimensional distribution.
Scientists believe that the plumage of this animal was dark brown above and carotenoid below.
The discovery also helps to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur does not have a well-developed shaft or rachis, but does have other features such as plumaceous and feathery barbs, the researchers concluded that it is likely the rachis developed after the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has adult plumage and not that of a juvenile.
Scientists suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not that of a juvenile.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate the observations that were made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was seeking was caused by the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
In the same way that the moon attracts the earth, causing the tides, the Camino de Santiago exerts force in the galaxy of Sagittarius.
The scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a circle, and is composed of many small particles.

The government also promised several million doses of the encephalitis vaccine, which will help health organizations prepare for the coming year.
The vaccine delivery plans in historically harder-hit areas were delayed due to a lack of funds and low prioritization compared to other diseases.

However, it fits with them being large holes in the ground," commented Glen Cushing from the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is generally an experience that involves little technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their preferences into an envelope.
After the polling table verifies the voter's identity, the latter casts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter roll.

Since 1988, the electoral ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes present at the start of voting and that no others are mixed in except those of counted and authorized voters.
The different candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the afternoon, the volunteers count the votes under close supervision, following specific procedures.

The deputy inspector general D K Arya said: “we arrested five people responsible for the rape of the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and her laptop.”
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although the house was occupied by three people when the car crashed, they were not injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services extricated the driver of the Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget hospital in Yarmouth.
Afterwards he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of killing her son.
Is under custody awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness will remain under suspicion due to the public dissemination of their image.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts viewed the publication of images as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, emphasizes that "journalists could be putting themselves at risk if they publish images and information about the suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, told journalists that no other comment would be made, at least until the charges were presented.
The document, according to the leak, refers to the border dispute, which the Palestinians want to establish with the boundaries that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other discussed matters include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands ten years of permanent military presence in the valley after signing the agreement, while the PA agrees to allow such presence for only five years.
The shooters of the supplementary pest control program had to be closely supervised by the guards while the program was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
The partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were selected as part of the association's sports shooters hunting program.
Memories with Mick O'Flynn, interim director of Parks Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first hunt had complete training in safety and training.
Martelly took the oath of office in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council (CEP) as part of a set of measures aimed at leading the country to new elections.
The commission was the response that Martelly gave to the thousands of protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the inability to organize elections, some of which should have taken place in 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods were reported due to overheating, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said they had been presented with 27 cases of incidents involving the devices.
A week ago, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan announced that Apple reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:10 p.m. on Friday GMT).
The emergency management office of the Northern Marianas said that no damage was reported in the nation.
Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a Tsunami.

Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several detained people were rescued and there are at least six confirmed victims.
Six hostages were freed, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman while she was going to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he worked at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his free time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, fetal lung maturation could be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" recorders from Wednesday's flight.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute to her.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna is as weird as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place.”
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by eight percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the people in the survey share this point of view, wanting Elizabeth II of England to be the last monarch of Australia.
As outcomes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was going to swim in the 100 and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is in doubt.
He could not take the necessary medicines to overcome the pain because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the highest prime number on January 25.
Many people verified the discovery with various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins that support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a lot.
Cuomo, 53, began his term at the start of this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriages.
Referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
It is speculated that he/she will run for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says would allow aircraft to make shorter flights, saving millions of gallons in fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It makes use of satellite technology instead of the old technology based on ground radar technology. With this, it aims to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no extraordinary transport and surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and short-term parking are not available on the surface.
The fear of lack of transport opened up the possibility that the match would be played behind closed doors without the presence of the teams' fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is assumed to have taken much longer, due to the breeding between Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take many shapes. It can be rolled into fine forms.
It can be made into fine wire to handle and braid. It can be forged or made into sheets with it.
It can be made very fine and inlaid in another metal. It can become so fine that sometimes it was used to decorate the miniatures of some books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using purple cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or soft (alkaline) the substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons are removed (because hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two types of dry powder and then, with clean and wet hands, press it into a ball shape.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers. You will feel something strange as it forms a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in practically every house, linked to an advanced sewerage system.
Remains of drainage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere alters some of the light and vision.
It is necessary to have a 100-foot tall rocket to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the invention did for us was to provide us with easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car, and many other transports brought us.
Beneath them are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including common cats) that eat smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of success is the niche concept, a special job that each of the cats has and that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three related males along with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are often related to each other, forming a large family of daughters and sisters.
Lion prides function similarly to those of wolves or dogs, animals that closely resemble lions (though not other big cats) in their behavior and are also very harmful to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete: it can climb (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the powerful roar of the lion, it is like a phrase of hoarse shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots like and find animals to eat (hunt) by smell, sniffing their trail on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very smoothly. The ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging with the environment and jumping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the original population (if they go to live in the mountains or by the river, or they move to an island, from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment very different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the population will require distinct characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than they were before.
The original population hasn't changed a bit; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapted to its new environment, they began to resemble the other population less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so distinct that they will not be able to be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an important and inevitable consequence for evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, they release it).
The plants make their food by photosynthesizing the sun. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Without plants, the animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasauruses.
Their large jaws have more than 70 teeth sharp as knives with an extra row in the roof of the mouth, which means there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We are not entirely sure, but it could have had a bifid tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, mosasaurs, and it might have been cannibalistic.
It attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex was a match for it.
While most of their food would seem familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women eat their meals sitting on chairs, rich men have banquets together where they lie on their sides while eating.
The ancient Roman meals could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn’t have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa. And no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered as the house of the god.
The people made sacrifices to the gods and the priests attended to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and within it an inner sanctuary that only the priests can enter.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The highest point of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
A large part of the Hebrew family's life was outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were counters that opened onto the street. To build houses, they used stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling westward, he came across Greenland and named it so.
But without considering this discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there in that period.
Although each of the countries is "Scandinavian", there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that in the beginning, the parchment (measuring 29.75 by 24.50 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Then, it seems likely that the notation will only be added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was governed by the Vichy faction, who were the French that became allies of the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American forces and the Free French Forces will liberate the south of France and head towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a representative group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which, in some way, defines the greatness of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves passing knowledge through many generations, a cultural legacy that is preserved, and significant dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving historically significant traces and are not properly recognized as civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – with Congress as the only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress did not have the authority to levy taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it depended on state authorities, who did not usually cooperate, to pass all the laws.
Nor did it have the authority to annul fiscal legislation or tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states regarded the central government so little that the representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and was the world champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, hockey on skates, and Formula 1 races.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, there are Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7000 islands (the largest of them is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the grouping of islands that the country has, Japan is geographically an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1627, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the grain production practices of the aborigines and employing Chinese workers in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the west and north coasts of Taiwan; they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they originally were.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but the most important thing is that its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, paradoxically, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (from the APS family, for example) have the same or very similar proportion.
The rule of thirds, so often used and sometimes ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
He states that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and gained power, was subjected to scrutiny.
The Christian religion united various European states for more than a thousand years, despite the differences in language and culture.
His overwhelming power affects all layers of society, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist precisely for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led to questioning whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the war began, Great Britain initiated the naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off both military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law and ratified by several international agreements from the two previous centuries.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was poor, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the attitude most widespread among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States of America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of illustrating distinct periods of time; each era of China or each family in power was a distinctive dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these is the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods, there were fierce wars between nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest throne of the great palace of Xi’an.
It resulted in numerous social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to its people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover, with the Revolution, the positions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and wealthy to succeed.
The same happens with the army because instead of basing military classifications on class, they are currently based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working classes from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters of worldly life. He used to go to a cave that came to be known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, provides a clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca is this cave, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even knowing of its existence. Once inside the cave, you are in total isolation.
One can see nothing but the beautiful and clear sky and the mountains that surround it. Few things of this world enter this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramidal constructions made according to the deceased pharaoh.
The plateau of Giza or the "Necropolis of Giza," located in the valley of the Egyptian dead, includes several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples to honor his wives and relatives.
The "arc up" symbol resembles a V, and the "arc down" symbol resembles a staple or a small square without the bottom line.
Upwards means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and downwards means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upper arch produces a softer sound, while a lower one is stronger and more assertive.
You can take notes, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons and must be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (eleven-year-old Maria Teresa and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Elisabeth of France, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market-working women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people yelling and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd impaled the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the United States' imperialism in the Philippine war were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States of America to finance a large part of the expenses and interests of the bonds advanced in the name of the Filipino government through banking institutions of Wall Street.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos were the main gains of the United States' imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events unfold is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the early high middle ages, and followed by the late middle ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a broad set of ideas, ranging from technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict sense in which human destiny is dominated by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely removed from political or cultural influence and that technology, for its part, has effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily encourages the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable with only a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The possession of a large number of cars also leads to a greater number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had much cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time habits and cultures tied to this geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place in society, were better than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is seen as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status grew significantly in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts like silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was then that the title of Capital of Fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style emerged during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing in the East was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, through the slow communication channels, Western styles could remain 25 or 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the era was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes, as a result of the crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is the kind that is done to have enough production to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often ecological system that uses seeds from the ecoregion along with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers developed a subsistence agriculture and this is what happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures group together similar individuals who feel a rejection of societal standards and help them develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic of the age, ethnicity, class, place, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine that a culture is distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their belonging through the use of a distinct and symbolic style, which includes fashions, gestures, and jargon.
One of the most common methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to point out the few and unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, bad luck, or premeditated abuse, were not socialized with adults as they grew up.
These children are called "xabaces" or wild ones. Some of them were confined (usually by their own fathers and mothers); in some cases, this abandonment of the children is due to the parents' rejection in the face of a severe physical or mental disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
It is assumed that some were raised by animals; of others, it is said that they lived alone in the wild nature.
When they are raised entirely by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animals that cared for them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that aids individuals who are undergoing a learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the Microsoft Office paperclip.
Virtual scaffolds enter into the software and aim to question, recall, and explain the procedures that might have been difficult for the student to revise on their own.
Children go to foster homes for many reasons, from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where there is no care, education, and affection, but they do.
We conclude that the Foster Care service is a safe environment for these children.
Our reception system provides safe homes, welcoming caregivers, regular education, and quality healthcare.
It is assumed that the foster homes provide all the means that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of interpersonal communication and mass communication.
The particularities of the Internet encourage additional dimensions in what concerns the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, "to learn" and "to socialize" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their research on public reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is ensured that no one can detect if someone is lying through the correct interpretation of micro expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President’s Speech, indicated that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are, to some extent, capable of evaluating sincerity accurately.
He goes as far as to suggest that these abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two genetic reserves: silent and expressed.
The mutation adds genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination generate variation between two genetic reserves in each generation.
There in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to be able to meet their amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Moreover, not doing it has serious consequences: it increases depression, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to find would be the proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides proteins that contain essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of waking up voluntarily during your usual sleep period and falling back asleep shortly afterward (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved easily by using an alarm that is not too loud, so it distracts you without fully waking you up.
If you find that you are turning off the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking lots of liquids (especially water or tea, a famous diuretic) before going to sleep, forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and spirit.
The less tension there is, the more positive is the vital energy. Each person has the capacity to achieve complete peace and joy.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that can prevent us is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded with the path of love from the Mahayana and with many techniques from Indian yoga.
Primarily, Tibetan Buddhism is perception. It comprises kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love and acceptance.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of several deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and conscious illumination is achieved.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which led the USSR and the United States of America to cooperate. At the end of the war, the confrontations between the systems, processes, and culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last the next 40 years and would truly be fought by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight after more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient means of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The armed forces are responsible for ensuring that your country maintains its ability to move citizens and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move population and goods.
One of the most notable nearby examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The United States was trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies fail, it is likely that Germany will conquer Great Britain and the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains, in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed over the mountains or other grazing areas, and were tended by goatherds, who were often children or young people, in a manner similar to the more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
The first railways were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagonways were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to gain more speed and haul larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
The sleepers were introduced early to support the tracks. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a normal practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known transport is walking. Humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
The australopithecines, their predecessors, did not walk upright so often.
The bipedal specialization was found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus was already walking upright seven million years ago.
We can begin to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
It is like a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we will need to find the root of the problems and we will have to disable it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to the advances in science and technology by humanity; problems are only increasing due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the nearby printing shop of John Dunlap.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on June 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 images that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
There are many who don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
Although there are many things in birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and spurs, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers nowadays handle information encoded in a binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits – or bits, using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general to make an early diagnosis.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medicines or household chemicals.
Read the label to obtain specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bedbugs and reduviid insects make nests, adapting to live in the nest or house of their host.
In the United States of America, there are around 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
The research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not what suits them best or what is best for them.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents lose parental rights so that another couple can have them over the child.
The primary objective of science is to discover the way in which the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most of scientific research.
However, it is not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations and guiding scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
The opinions of Aristotle were accepted in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greek diminished, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have seen that rhythms in psychology and behavior depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their manifestation in internal clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, are documented in the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that follow a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was conclusive in determining that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, which are viruses, to introduce their DNA into the bacteria.
They performed two experiments clearly marking the phage's DNA with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on the type, the importance of the fragment of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germinal.
Only mutations in germ cells have genetic transmission, although other types of mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Some examples of activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks to study information about their ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and cross paths with people who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport hub, everyone is connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this coal-intensive economy displaced the biosphere from one of the stable states that facilitated human evolution in the last two million years.
All people participate in society and use means of transportation. Almost everyone complains about those means of transportation.
In developed countries, you almost never encounter the same level of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints? Why do they do it daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have among them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to have reasonably uniform behavior; therefore, traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established among three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and carry out the facilities of the roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily and to find food and reproduce conveniently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarco said that the Solar System moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems to be what the senses perceive, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the flow of the second river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world because at some points it reaches 6 miles.
20 percent of the water that reaches the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River measures 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City employs Italian in its legislation and communication.
Italian is the usual language for most state workers, while Latin is also used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Some basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper have been known since antiquity, and all of them can be found in nature in their native metal form, being easy to extract using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had the theory that all things are made of mixtures of one or more elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
All things in the Universe are made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles, atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them could fit in the period that ends this sentence.
Thus, with its invention, the pencil made life easier for many people.
Sadly, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil is relegated to a lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to touch a keyboard.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The fission bomb uses the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with a lot of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is around 70 km thick at the nearest side and 100 km at the farthest side.
It is finer in the seas and larger in the high lands.
There could have been more quicksands in the nearby side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding what moves or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what is in certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One of the extremes is to continue being “one of them.”
This type of boss has a hard time making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning roles, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one mutates and becomes an unknown individual who believes he must change everything the team did and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often causes rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups have the same standards of excellence as conventional ones, but there are slight differences.
The members of the virtual team always function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than the conventional members of a team since they can meet according to different time zones, something that may not be understood by the local management.
The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which all the members report. The invisible team sets the standards for its components.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One of the methods to introduce learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively throughout the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome an obstacle by an organization can encourage a new innovative process that is available to meet the client's needs.
Before the organization can innovate, the leader must generate a culture of innovation and of common knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement perspective as a method used for organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data shows physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, the area of research narrows and becomes much more thorough.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that brain damage of different types, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect our behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that were never seen before.
That provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI sounds like something out of science fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence enables machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning, and programming, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and diagnoses, as well as recognizing handwriting, voices, and faces.
Such themes have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions for everyday problems.
The AI system is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and it has also been built into personal computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any class. Often, the teacher would like to take the students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology provides a solution with virtual excursions. The students can see museum objects, visit an aquarium, or engage with artworks while they are in the classroom.
Sharing a hike is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the Capital City; they update the previous one, but keep the versions to use as a template.
Blogs can also help to improve the student's writing. While students start the blog with careless grammar and spelling, the pressure of the audience usually changes this.
Since the students tend to be the most critical audience, the blog writer strives to improve the writing to prevent those criticisms.
Participating in a blog also "makes students achieve greater knowledge of the world around them." The need to stimulate public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is an activity that stimulates collaboration and motivates students to also learn outside of schools.
The good use of blogs "motivates students to critical analysis; with active exposure to content on the Internet, students define their opinions with the texts of other people and form their stance on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming Canadian capital of bilingualism, with plenty of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and the north harbors the unexplored natural beauty of the Muskoka area and beyond.
All that and more makes Ontario the basic Canadian [thing] for outsiders.
There are large areas in the north with low population, some are practically uninhabited lands of wild nature.
To make a comparison of population that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The eastern islands of Africa are in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach and tourist centers.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, with particular emphasis on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that women say that they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It helps a lot to wear a ring (though not one that looks very expensive).
The women have realized that cultural differences can result in them considering it inappropriate, and it's not uncommon for them to follow us, grab our arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and do not hesitate to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it is not permissible).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century AD and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish traders who set up bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a range of trinkets, all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the eastern extremity, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the city, especially in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, for any visit outside of Goma it is necessary to be informed about the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for ascending Mount Nyiragongo, as well as one of the cheapest places in all of Africa to go on excursions to see mountain gorillas.
You can go by boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an unplanned city, although its reputation makes it a tourist city. It has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage monuments in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops for Henry Louis Gates in the special “Wonders of the African World” on PBS.
The city has a clear contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arabic than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, and it runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a unique type of life.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the main one of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks)
Regarding the national parks of South Africa, they have conservation and park access fees.
It can be good for one to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists see as the main attraction.
The row of buildings that make up the urban landscape of Hong Kong has been compared to a shiny bar chart, helped by the presence of the water of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront, which is directly opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is located on land reclaimed from the sea along the north coast.
This is the place that the British settlers claimed as their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the interior territories of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The forest area in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not of the mangrove type, but rather they retain remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third corresponds to aquatic or swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary; currently, there are about 400 Bengal tigers and about 40,000 chitals in the area.
The buses leave from the intermodal station (on the other side of the river) during the day, and most, especially those going east or to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between districts are often full, it is recommended to purchase the ticket days in advance.
To most of the districts reach the small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and strong.
Shared taxis are quick and convenient means to go to nearby areas like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
It is estimated that the bridge will be fully operational by September 2017, a date by which the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní people were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of Chaco was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, called "the giant province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonial period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best soccer players in the world.
The major annual competition takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
More modest tournaments or matches at other times of the year can be seen here.
For news on tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the bank on the islands, in the locality of Stanley (opposite the FIC West store).
Sterling books are generally accepted on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are also accepted.
In remote islands, it's likely that credit cards aren't accepted, although British or United States currency is. Check with the owners ahead of time to know which payment method is accepted.
It's practically impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange the money before leaving there.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above 30ºC are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combined air and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There is no particular "rainy" or "dry" season: the rain remains practically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to seeing humans, the animals are wild and should not be disturbed or fed.
According to the park authorities, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how tame they seem, bison, moose, bears, and other large animals can attack you.
Every year, there are many visitors with injuries because they don't distance themselves enough. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so their space must be respected.
Keep in mind that odors attract bears and other types of animals; it's better to avoid carrying fragrant food or cooking aromatic dishes and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the scene of a notorious naval confrontation in the year 1889 when seven German, British, and United States ships refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the main chief Tupua Tamases Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the northern coast (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean; they stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are safe sandy beaches, and most have areas with pohutukawa trees providing shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are usually beaches filled with families with a variety of shops on the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is the “Number One”, which is not complex but pleasant and fresh. The other local beer is the “Manta”.
There are numerous kinds of French wine to taste, but those from New Zealand and Australia may travel better.
The tap water in the area can be safely drunk, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is something else. A black coffee is an "espresso," the cappuccino comes with cream to the top (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is at the level of the Belgians. The juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the coral reef are made every year, and injuries for these reasons there are rare.
However, follow the recommendations, respect the signs, and be careful with the safety measures.
Box jellyfish appear near the beaches and rivers from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside these dates.
Sharks exist, however, it is rare for them to attack humans. Most of them fear humans and leave if they see them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the sea. Their primary habitat is the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, ensuring a place to sleep upon arriving at the destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible that you can find other ways to accommodate yourself, like camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any change or request must be managed with the travel agency first, not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most of the attendees decide to camp, and for many it is an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the stages, you have to go early to camp near the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music ends on the main stages, there will be sections of the festival that will continue playing music until very late at night.
Some festivals have camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in the winter, look where the cabin is: if you sail with ice, there is a lot of noise.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. For cruise passengers, a visa is not necessary (check the terms).
Casinos strive to maximize the time and money that customers spend. There usually aren't any windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
In general, they have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep the guests in a good mood and retain them in the facilities.
Some houses offer free alcoholic drinks. However, being drunk means being out of control, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In snowstorms, enough snow can fall to block you in very little time.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfalls or blizzards or by the condensation of frost on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic goes uninterrupted all year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a significant experience for visitors.
The popularly used term safari is used to refer to land trips to observe the beautiful African wildlife, especially that of the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, often approach the cars, and the standard equipment allows for good views.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be cowardly and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called “savannah walk,” “hiking safari,” or simply “walking”) consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other places in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympic Games twice, having already hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before it was postponed, you could be in a complicated situation.
Policies vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus cancellations do not cover July 2020, the dates of the Games.
It is estimated that most of the tickets will cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with an average price of 7,000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If there are no irons or if you don't feel like having to iron everything including socks, you can try using a dryer (if you have one).
Be careful that the fabrics don’t reach high temperatures (which can cause them to shrink or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are different ways to filter water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is enough; in others, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of the filters varies, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter pests from animals that they are not used to in their home countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in a worse case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are not generally considered pests.
Buying in duty-free shops is the way to purchase goods free from direct and indirect taxes in some places.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can save a good amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated areas and forests.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you need to be attentive: there are many steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The speed limits on the signs are much lower than in the preceding and following sections — usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) — and it is very important to stay within them.
Strangely, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apple as an ingredient throughout the year and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German bakery products contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular pastries often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to try delicious pastries, try those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is generally used with curry; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is the term that encompasses the enormous variety of the country's regional cuisines.
But, if more adjectives are not used, the term refers to food originally from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of simple dishes. The predominant flavor is that of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on each side of the saddle.
They give more stability to the rider but can compromise their safety due to the risk of the feet getting stuck.
If a rider falls from a horse but has their foot caught in the stirrup, they can end up being dragged if the horse runs. To reduce this risk, some safety precautions must be taken.
