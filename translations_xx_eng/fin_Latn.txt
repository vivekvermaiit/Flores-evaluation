This confirms the already widely spread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but additionally, information was obtained that is not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
According to researchers, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and light or carotenoid-colored underneath.
Additionally, the discovery helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the feathers of the dinosaur do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but they do have other feather characteristics – such as barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development stage compared to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for thermoregulation or mating displays. Although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers proposed that the specimen originated from the plumage of an adult individual rather than the down of a juvenile.
Even though it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers suggested the specimen was from an adult individual's plumage rather than a chick's down.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the main police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.
It was announced by the office of the county governor that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
The police said they suspect that someone from Daesh (Isil) might be behind the attack.
They found out that the Sun follows the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all their system's stars was found to be due to luminosity and rotational and orbital motion, not anything else.
Luminosity and rotational motion are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less frequently polarity reversals occur in a star.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to observe the tidal effects between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravity affects the Earth causing tides, so too does the gravitational pull of the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.
Researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the galaxy's dark matter surrounds it as a kind of halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered a form of tuberculosis that is extremely resistant to drugs (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In the interview, he said that the new variant is very concerning and alarming due to the extremely high mortality rate.
Some patients may have contracted the infection in the hospital, Moll believes, and at least two of them were part of the hospital's healthcare staff.
An infected person can themselves infect 10–15 close contacts over the course of a year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among all tuberculosis patients still seems low – 6,000 out of South Africa's total of 330,000 annual cases.

"Their thermal behavior is not as consistent as in the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the Astrogeology Team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and a lecturer at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally not been high-tech: voters shut themselves in booths and place a pre-printed paper slip, on which they have marked their chosen candidate, into an envelope.
Once the authorities have verified the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral legislation has determined the course of events relatively precisely.
In 1988, ballot boxes were required to be transparent so that voters and observers could verify that there were no envelopes in the box at the beginning of the voting and that no other envelopes than officially counted and authorized ballots were added to the box.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the sequence of events. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with prescribed procedures.

The old man's gun did not work when it was pointed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider suffers from constant pain and blindness in one eye. The missing part of his skull and face has been reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider gave his testimony via video call from a United States Air Force base located in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday's competition, Carpanedo participated in two other individual competitions of the World Championships.
The first of them was slalom, in which his first run was left unfinished. 36 out of 116 participants also failed to reach the finish line.
In her second competition, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a total time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 slower than Austria's Claudia Loesch who came first, and 1:09.02 slower than Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani, who placed ninth.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group were unable to finish their run, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not place in the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.

The names of the accused have been reported as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed as the rescue service freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital located in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but the eyewitness evidence may be compromised since his picture has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scotland's legal system works differently, and the courts have considered that publishing images may harm an impartial trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee states that "journalists do seem to be dangerously balancing if they publish photos and such of suspects."
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, generally responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that there will be no further comments on the matter, at least not before the charges are presented.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to be as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the information, other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement. The Palestinian Authority accepts this kind of presence only for five years.
The forest rangers were supposed to closely monitor the shooters participating in the supplementary pest control trial, as the experiment was being observed and its effectiveness assessed.
Volunteers meeting the requirements were recruited as a joint initiative between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association of NSW, as part of the shooting association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director responsible for the protection and cultural heritage of the NPWS parks, the four shooters selected for the initial shootings received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Martelly recognized nine members at yesterday's meeting of the interim electoral council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
The delegation appointed by the President recommended last month that the previous interim election council resign as part of a package of measures intended to lead the country toward new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Protests, which occasionally escalated into violence, originated from elections that failed to take place, some of which were supposed to be held as early as 2011.
Malfunctioning iPods have been reported to overheat in about 60 cases, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the ministry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 other cases of overheating, which the company referred to as "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the investigation made by Apple "truly unfortunate."
The earthquake affected the Marianas at 7:19 local time (on Friday at 21:19 Greenwich Mean Time).
According to the Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency, no damages were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no indications of a tsunami forming.
A former Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, among them children and the elderly, were released ahead of time along with the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the seat of an elderly woman when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza died in the shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working in 1959 at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth during his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone accelerates the development of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that an official investigation team found two black boxes, or flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Quite a unique case just like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Before the federal parliamentary elections in 2010, a survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted. The number of those opposing Australia's transition to a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal parliamentary election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed shared his view and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the study, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was supposed to participate in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle events and three relay competitions at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition has been uncertain due to pain.
He has not been able to take the medication needed for pain relief because their use is prohibited in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a computer science professor and mathematician at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people had confirmed the discovery with different devices and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, and especially how the Earth was formed, as comets collided with the Earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo's term as governor began earlier this year, and last month he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political jawboning and ridiculous."
It is believed that he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
The United States aviation authority claims that NextGen is a system that allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older, ground-based radar technology. This allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be arranged, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are also no parking or park and ride services available at the venue.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the development of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although the series of events was believed to take much longer. The reason was the interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the invasive species cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can also be rolled into very small objects.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminations."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make a meter yourself using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (i.e., basic) the substance is.
The amount of hydrogen ions (pH's H) in the tested chemical indicates the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean and wet hands.
The moisture of your hands reacts with the outermost layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of crust.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushable toilet connected to a complex drainage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Greece on Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where women and men bathed together in the same facilities.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite located in space receives a call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space aboard a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet long is needed.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. Much easier and faster movement is the greatest thing the bicycle has done for us.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Beneath them come the medium-sized felines, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Then there are also many small felines (including stray pet cats) that eat small prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, whose numbers are much larger.
The secret of their success is the so-called ecological niche. According to this concept, each feline has its own special role, which is why it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males and sometimes up to thirty females and pups.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like packs of wolves or dogs. These animals surprisingly resemble lions in their behavior (but not other big cats), and they too are very dangerous to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not very well), swim, jump far and pull five times as powerfully as a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same big cat genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats are capable of roaring.
A tiger's roar does not resemble a lion's full-bodied roar, but rather a sentence composed of grumbled, shouted words.
Ocelots are happy to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all of the animals hunted by the ocelot are much smaller than the ocelot itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find edible animals, or prey, by sniffing the ground for their scent where they have passed.
Ocelots see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and move really stealthily. They hunt by blending into their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or to a new island, so that it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different from before.
The resources of a new environment are different and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor, a new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, but still requires the same adaptations as before.
When a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, over time it starts to resemble the main population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations appear so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they use carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We make our house out of plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was a top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
In its long jaws were more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and in addition, it had an extra row of teeth in the palate, so nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We are not sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it might even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus rex would not have stood a chance against it.
Most of their food would indeed be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own peculiar or unusual festive delicacies, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the edible dormouse.
As another difference, the poor and women ate their meals sitting on a chair, whereas the rich preferred to organize communal feasts where they would recline on their side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not feature foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They did not have, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to fulfill the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
In each temple, there was an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, the so-called Holy of Holies, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes temples were built with pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not as important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
The women cooked food outside, and the shops were merely open sales tables along the streets. Stone was used as the building material for the houses.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the Norse sagas, it was said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland due to murder, and while traveling west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived on the island at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" are written on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence. The writing is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Nobody knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ inches by 24 ½ inches) was rolled up for storage in the early days.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added merely as a sort of name tag.
D-Day, that is the landings and the subsequent battles, had liberated Northern France, but the South was not yet free.
It was under the so-called Vichy France, meaning the French who, in 1940, had made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the invaders rather than fighting against them.
The Allies attacked southern France on August 15, 1944. The code name for the attack was Operation Dragoon.
The United States and Free French forces liberated Southern France in just two weeks and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people living and working in cooperation, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civilian or citizen. It is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it somewhat also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture refers to the transfer of knowledge from multiple generations to another, a long-term cultural footprint, and a fairly wide distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving necessary historical evidence, so they are generally not regarded as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - whose only component was Congress - based on the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive authority or judiciary, it had to rely on state officials, who were often unwilling to cooperate, to enforce all of its regulations.
It also did not have the power to change tax laws and customs duties between states.
Amending the articles required the unanimous approval of all the states, and the states were so indifferent towards the central government that often their representatives were not present.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world alongside the German national team. It won the football World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians even compete in them at international matches and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the world's seventh-largest island!
Because the islands of Japan are in a cluster or a group, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan became known as early as the 15th century when European sailors passing by mentioned the island using the name Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624. At the same time, it initiated changes in the agricultural methods of the indigenous people and hired Chinese workers for its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty's (1644–1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
After experiencing defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: these are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better understanding of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues even now.
For example, the most common size used in still images worldwide is 35 mm. It was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced, but above all, digital camera image sensor formats have inherited its aspect ratio.
Somewhat confusingly, the 35-millimeter size is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this size (when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest size ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and much mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline to create dynamism in an image while still retaining some degree of order.
According to it, the most effective place for the main subject is at the point where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be scrutinized closely.
Christianity had united the states of Europe for over a thousand years despite differences in languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone, both kings and commoners.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are intended precisely for such use.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money made many question the implementation of the doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the vital supply deliveries to soldiers and civilians, even though the blockade violated internationally accepted law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire oceanic areas, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since the tactic elicited only limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations decided to avoid similar situations in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way to describe different periods: Each phase of China or each ruling family was its own dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty, there was a period of unstable division of provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely in their quest for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for access to the highest seat in the mighty palace of Xi’an.
There were many social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, the nationalistic idea, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the revolution, the positions were opened to all male applicants. Thus, the most ambitious and successful could thrive.
The same applied to the army, as military ranks were now based on ability instead of social status.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammed was deeply interested in matters beyond everyday life. He often went to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira and was located on Mount Nur, which means light.
The cave itself, which was left in peace by the ravages of time, creates a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on one of the mountains rising north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Only the clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains are visible. From inside the cave, one sees or hears very little of the earthly world.
In the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, located on the Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 200s BCE, is one of the many large pyramid-shaped structures made in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, also known as the Giza Necropolis, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign of a rising bow looks like the letter V, and the sign of a falling bow is like a staple or a square missing the underscore.
An ascending bow means that you should start from the tip and push the bow. Descending means that you should start from the frog (the part where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An ascending bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow is stronger and firmer.
You are free to add your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed articulation marks are in the sheet music for musical reasons, so they should generally be followed.
A crowd composed of working-class women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Elisabeth from Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They came back to Paris in carriages, surrounded by a crowd shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a bodyguard killed at Versailles in front of the shocked queen.
The Filipinos had to pay themselves for the war costs caused by the conquest of the Philippines to American imperialism.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial administration, covering a significant portion of the costs, and to take care of the interest on the bonds issued by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
The basic benefit of American imperialism, of course, consisted of the enormous profits gained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the Knights Templar, one needs to understand the background against which the organization was formed.
The era of events is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between the years 1000 and 1300 AD.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that practically covers a wide range of ideas on the so-called driving force of technology, in other words, the necessity of technology, to such an absolute notion that human destiny is governed by logic based on scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two common basic ideas: firstly, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and secondly, that technology, in turn, has inherent rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
As an example, one could argue that the invention of the car inevitably leads to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars results in more traffic accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare methods for repairing damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a significant element in Romanticism and was drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was seen as shaping individuals. Over time, customs and culture characteristic of this geographical location formed. Because these were in harmony with society, they functioned better than arbitrarily enacted laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe in the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about the year 1100.
Its position weakened in the 12th century mainly because the crusaders had returned home with gifts like silk and spices, which were more appreciated than what the Byzantine markets had to offer.
It was precisely at that time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothes were strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
Due to slow communication channels, Western European styles, however, might have been 25–30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As one of the most significant developments of the era, people began to use buttons to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is agriculture where enough food is produced only to sustain the farmer and their family.
A subsistence economy is a simple, often organic-based system that uses seeds native to the eco-region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize the yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel rejected by societal norms, enabling them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as its own and distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, related to gender or sexuality, geographical, or combinations of various factors.
Often members of a subculture communicate their membership through the characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and their own slang.
One of the most common methods of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use as an example those few unfortunate children who were deprived of adult-provided socialization as they grew up, either due to neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse.
These children are called "wild". Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents). In some cases, the abandonment has been due to the parents rejecting the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are alleged to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
If a feral child has been raised entirely by an animal and not by a human, they will (within the limits of their physical constraints) behave almost exactly like their guardian animal, for example, by displaying similar fear or indifference towards humans.
The purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting. Timely support for learning (scaffolding) goes one step further.
Ladders are not a learning method but a tool that supports individuals in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Ladders can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the little paperclip figure in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is built into the software, and its purpose is to pose questions, give prompts, and explain procedures that might have been too challenging for the learner without anyone's help.
Children are placed in foster homes for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but some do.
We consider the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
The purpose of our foster care system is to provide a safe home, loving guardians, consistent education, and reliable healthcare.
The purpose of placing the children is to meet all of their basic needs that were lacking in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet imply additional dimensions in the case of the use-case theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important influences for Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new perspectives of motives in their study of audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
It has been specifically claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to identify if a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks described how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech, can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domesticated dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
A mutation introduces new genetic variation, selection removes it from the pool of occurred variations.
Segregation and recombination transfer variation back and forth between these two reservoirs with each generation.
A primate, which has a digestive system similar to that of a human, finds it difficult to obtain enough amino acids from the plants available on the savanna.
In addition, the absence of these can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily available plant resources would have been the proteins obtained from leaves and legumes, but primates like us find it difficult to digest them without cooking.
Instead, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digestible, and additionally, they provide abundant proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Therefore, we have no reason to be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption refers to deliberately waking up during a normal sleep cycle and falling asleep again a little later (after 10–60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, which restores consciousness but does not fully awaken.
If you notice yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before going to bed, which necessitates getting out of bed to urinate.
The amount of a person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force is. It is possible for everyone to find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it also includes the concept of Mahayana, or the great path, and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The central practice of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Visualizing deities cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and develops awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated. After the war ended, the clashes of systems, procedures, and cultures led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and there was actual war, as proxy armies fought on battlefields in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered the country and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern parts of Poland. This was against the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other both bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The mission of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their own country retains the ability to move its own people and goods while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy mostly attempted to obstruct this traffic with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them to easily obtain milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were typically raised in herds that roamed in hilly terrain or other pastures. They were often tended by goatherds, who were frequently children or young people, much like the more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon roads consisted solely of parallel wooden planks, they enabled horses to pull wagons faster and with larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of that era.
Railway sleepers were introduced fairly early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if there was a strip of iron on top of them.
The practice became common, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the carriages more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking. People began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (also known as upright man) evolved.
The preceding Australopithecus did not walk upright as consistently.
Specialization in bipedalism can be found in the 4.2–3.9 million-year-old fossils of Australopithecus, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often akin to treating the symptoms of an illness, but if we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the roots of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have grown because of overpopulation and humanity's wasteful way of life.
After Congress had approved it on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and secretary, Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
During the night, 150–200 copies were printed, which are now known as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon read the document aloud publicly for the first time in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. One copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 known surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many of today's paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still living. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there is a lot about birds that still looks like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers currently in use are based on the processing of data coded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers – or, in the professional jargon of computer circuits, bits.
Internal poisoning is not necessarily immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The surest sign of internal poisoning is a visible, opened medicine bottle or a container with toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions relating to the said poison.
Entomologists use the term true bugs specifically for this group of insects.
The term derives from the fact that, in ancient times, bedbugs were very common. Bedbugs are insects that are well adapted as parasites of humans.
Bedbugs and bat bugs are both nidicolous, adapted to living in their host's nest or dwelling.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or MS, making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS disease affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have a double tendency to develop MS compared to men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not in their own or their child's best interest.
These couples can, if they wish, create an adoption plan for their little one.
In adoption, biological parents relinquish their rights to parenthood, allowing another couple to act as the child's parents.
The main task of science is to determine how the world works using scientific methods. The scientific method also guides most scientific research.
However, it is not only about conducting experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classic texts and particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including in the field of psychology.
As the proficiency in the Greek language declined in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in body structure and behavior often depend very fundamentally on the existence of intrinsic cycles and their emergence through biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms that are not merely reactions to external seasonal stimuli have been observed in most living beings, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a freely operating cycle for a certain period even in the absence of external stimuli.
The research by Hershey and Chase was one of the most important pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments by labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, how significant the part of the genome they impact is, and whether they affect germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations that occur in germ cells can be inherited by children, and mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites with the purpose of enjoying the landscapes – including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities at the travel destination include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and exploring information about ecosystems.
One example that can be mentioned is visiting the orangutans of Borneo, learning about them, and photographing them.
Every morning, the residents of small rural towns set off in their cars to work, meeting others coming from the direction they themselves left, whose workplaces are where they themselves just left from.
In such dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to and at the same time supports the car-based traffic system.
Science now provides evidence that the massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere away from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are traffic planners just incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave relatively consistently. Thus, traffic flows generally have reasonably good coherence and can be presented in a rough mathematical manner.
To better describe traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps in the planning, design, and maintenance of the road network.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their bodies.
This way, they have a wider selection of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are currently the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that is, that the entire Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, as the Earth does not feel like it is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world. It has over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a maximum width of 6 miles.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from our planet's rivers into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The actual length of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or craftsmanship of the pyramids of Giza was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of the Vatican City State is about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the smallest state in the world by population.
The Vatican City State uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communication.
Most of the people working in the state also speak Italian in their everyday language, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have been familiar with common chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because all of them occur naturally in their elemental form and because they are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a combination of one or more elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more reminiscent of the four states of matter – in the order of solid, liquid, gas, and plasma – but he also theorized that they transform into other substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals. There are, of course, also metals like gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil became a good friend to many when it entered the market.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing have developed, the value and purposes of the pencil have become more neglected.
Nowadays, messages are written on a computer screen, and there's no need to ever search for a sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard once something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus composed of many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which makes them prone to decay from a slight or nonexistent nudge.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called its crust.
The thickness of the Moon's crust is about 70 kilometers on the side visible from Earth and about 100 kilometers on the far side of the Moon.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker on the plateaus.
There may be more dark ocean areas on the visible side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories primarily focus on examining what is behind people's behavior or what appeals to them.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they have matured.
These theories examine why some people want what they want, and what factors in their environment make them do or refrain from doing certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders begin to lead their former peers, generally two different behavior patterns can develop. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
A leader like this has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, assessing performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything the group has done and make it their own.
The leader, after all, is ultimately responsible for the group's successes and failures.
Such behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members serve as liaisons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones and their local management may not always understand this.
The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique components of a virtual team.
The invisible team is a leadership team to which all members report. The invisible team determines the requirement level for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process that establishing a learning organization requires? One of the goals of implementing systematic learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all the functioning departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create an innovative culture and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
From neurobiological data, we obtain physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying consciousness. Therefore, it narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The proliferation of new technologies provides the opportunity to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
In this way, we gain a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of information technology that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
In artificial intelligence research, the goal is to enable machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become distinct fields of study, focusing on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Nowadays, artificial intelligence is frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and national defense, just as it is embedded in many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of education. Often, the teacher would like to take the students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution, namely virtual field trips. Students can view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting at their desks.
Sharing the class trip virtually is an excellent way to remember it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The site is renewed annually, but its old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the early stages of students' blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often careless, but the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make an effort to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to understand the world around them better." The need to feed the reader's interest encourages students to be clever and engaging (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can provide students with the opportunity to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position against the background of other people's writings and bring out their own perspective on the issue at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital city, featuring an abundance of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north is, among other things, the pristine, scenic Muskoka.
These and many other factors create the impression of Ontario as a place that outsiders consider a quintessential example of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The following demographic comparison surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens in Canada overall.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest of them and is like its own continent in terms of nature.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or part of France, and they are known as luxurious beach destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to the lands, and it gained a lot of momentum in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women – All female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it doesn't look too valuable).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to situations they might perceive as harassment. It's not unusual for someone to start following them, grab their arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not justify advances!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 9th century BCE by Berber fishermen, and it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar-ul-Badya, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping places in Morocco.
In the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but all of that is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city center.
Goma is relatively safe, but all trips outside the city require preliminary research to determine the current state of ongoing battles in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano. There you can also find some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trackers in Africa.
To get around in the city, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
When this is combined with its relatively challenging location, "Timbuktu" has begun to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites in 1990 due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city is a stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabian than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of the park is 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different nature zones, each supporting a different variety of wildlife and plants.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African national parks (SANParks).
A daily conservation and entrance fee is charged at the park, as in all national parks in South Africa.
It may be useful to also buy a Wild Card, which provides access to either some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong area, and it is the main destination for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that forms the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to a sparkling column chart, which is best reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best aspects of Hong Kong can be seen by leaving the island and heading to the Kowloon harbor area located opposite.
The majority of the urban area on Hong Kong Island is located on the densely built landfill on the northern shore.
This is the very place that British colonial masters claimed as their own, and if one is looking for traces of the area's colonial history, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest area in the world. It extends 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast into the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on the Indian side is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps, but include some of the last remnants of those mighty jungles that once covered the entire Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about one-third of which is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 chital deer.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakari and Bumthang, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
As the local buses are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are serviced by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdily built.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes that are three and a half meters wide.
The bridge clearance height is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian border checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that lived in the area of present-day Eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, but they also practiced subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, lived in the Chaco region, subsisting through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples of the land in the 16th century.
The Spaniards began the colonial era, which lasted three hundred years.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the world's best polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched during other seasons.
The Argentine Polo Association provides news about tournaments and places to purchase tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to match the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
English pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley as well.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in the outer islands, although the currencies of Great Britain and the United States may be valid. Find out the acceptable payment method by asking the owners in advance.
Exchanging the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands is almost impossible, so make sure to exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and temperatures over 30 degrees are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no specific rainy seasons and dry seasons: the amount of rain remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities advise staying at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wildlife.
Bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, even though they may appear very docile.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, please take into account that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or preparing strongly scented foods and keep the camp tidy.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is slightly under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In the harbor, a notorious naval standoff was experienced in 1889 when seven vessels – German, American, and British – refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost at the same time.
During the independence campaign organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering held in the city led to the killing of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches because Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three different areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and pohutukawa trees provide shade for most.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches, and the shoreline is lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The primary local beer is "Number One". It is not a multidimensional beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are several French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines might endure the journey better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but cautious people can easily find bottled water.
The idea of a flat white-type milk coffee is foreign to Australians. A small black coffee is known as an espresso, and a cappuccino is served with a large amount of whipped cream instead of foamed milk. Tea is served without milk.
The cocoa meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are pricey but excellent.
Many trips are organized to the reef throughout the year, and injuries for any of these reasons are rare on the reef.
Therefore, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found north of 1770 near shores and estuaries from October to April. Occasionally, they can also be encountered at other times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and are likely to swim away from the area.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the sea; their primary habitat is the river deltas north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveler gains peace of mind knowing that upon reaching the destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agencies often have offers on certain hotels, but through the travel agency it might also be possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation active if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your property (e.g., a visa).
However, all changes and requests should be directed through the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, a large majority of music festival attendees decide to camp in the area, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you need to arrive on time to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even after the main stage music performances have ended, there may be places at the festival where music continues to play late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, because passing through ice can produce very terrible noise in the worst areas.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms and conditions).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are usually no windows and clocks, and finding exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep the customers in a good mood—and within the casino premises.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone intending to drive at high latitudes or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or extremely cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and you cannot drive in the same way as you would on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that a car can get stuck.
Snowfall or snow blowing in the wind, as well as moisture or ice accumulated on vehicle windows, may also impair visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally operates year-round without interruptions.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest attraction and a highlight for many visitors.
In common terms, the word safari refers to traveling by land with the purpose of observing Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment is quite sufficient for observing them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, trekking safari, or hiking) refers to a trip lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be organized in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it was the host of the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, your situation may be difficult.
Cancellation policies vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most of the coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with tickets typically costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. In many hotels, it is possible to borrow an iron and ironing board even if they are not in the room itself.
If an iron is not available or if you don't particularly care for ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (as it may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various methods for water purification, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in other areas, several minutes are required.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have doubts, it is worth considering purchasing water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not accustomed to in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, and transmit diseases.
Actual contagious diseases or such dangerous animals that can harm or kill people violently are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping means the opportunity to purchase products in certain places that are exempt from excise and sales taxes.
Travelers who go to countries with heavy taxation may sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh Highway because it repeatedly passes through remote forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: you'll encounter many steep hills and descents, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The specified speed limits are significantly lower than on the preceding and following sections – generally 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 kilometers per hour) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, the mobile phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are particularly hearty and diverse, reminiscent of the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often taste particularly good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you're craving small but sturdy pastries, try one called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries. In Southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is typically used.
Since there are 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an overarching concept that encompasses a wide range of regional food cultures around the country.
But if the term is used without additional definitions, it generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, and it includes a large array of simply seasoned dishes. Flavors favored by the Javanese include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the rider's foot supports that hang on either side of the saddle.
The rider gets more stability from them, but there may be safety concerns associated with them because the rider's legs might get caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the runaway horse might end up dragging them along. Various precautionary measures can be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most riders use riding boots with heels that have a smooth and rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup strap to detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's number one climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America. The valley features various large granite walls and rock cliffs.
The views from the peaks are breathtaking. Climbers from around the world continually create new routes on its endless walls.
Skiing disciplines, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snowy terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as ski bums, plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular destination.
Skiing as a concept is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers were made as early as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 1600s, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first leisure ski resort in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called wilderness skiing, ski touring, or trek skiing.
It is related to alpine-style trekking or mountaineering, but it usually doesn't involve such activities, because the latter is practiced in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can progress somewhat faster than on foot, but you will only very rarely reach the same speed as when skiing on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but there are many independent countries there. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean filling out visa applications and passing passport controls many times.
However, the Schengen Area operates in this respect somewhat like a unified state.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money, and the hassle of paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define all items over one hundred years old as antiques.
The definition varies according to geographical location. For example, in North America, newer items are considered antique than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be classified as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the associated culture is also important to many practitioners of other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami people have engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they have lived off fishing, hunting, and similar livelihoods, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If there is a travel advisory for the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance and trip cancellation insurance.
Perhaps it is worth asking for advice from other countries in addition to your own, even though their advice is meant for their own citizens.
As one example, Americans may find themselves in different situations in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The announcements are just brief summaries of a country's political situation.
The views presented are often superficial, generalized, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available from other sources.
Hazardous weather is a general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that may cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types that may depend on geography, surface formations, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hailstorms, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Dangerous weather regional and seasonal phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of hazardous weather affecting the destination, as it may impact travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that can be interpreted as a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for the term "Hostile Environment Course" will likely result in the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the topics discussed here in much more detail and generally combined with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about surviving in the wilderness are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports that do not indicate gender (X), or to update documents to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
The security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery should not expect to pass through security scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the backflow of waves breaking on the shore. They are often found on reefs or similar places.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and there a rapid current can form into deep water.
Most deaths result from exhaustion when trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be swept away by the current again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, it might be wise to wait for rescuers.
Reverse culture shock hits earlier than culture shock (the adjustment phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to get accustomed to a new country.
People may not necessarily realize that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the show starts, they can be seen in complete silence.
One usually always hears the voices of travelers and vendors. The story of light and sound is just like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is the background of a long story and its narrator.
Scenes are presented against the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Many countries have claimed the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases. In 2020, there were sixteen active bases.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled crater of an active volcano serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea south of the peninsula.
There, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plain and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, the Sentinel Range houses Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile phones have no coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone because to make a call, you have to be outside and have an unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is often used in maritime traffic, including on yachts. Similarly, it is used by expeditions that need remote data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider will probably be able to provide more information on connecting to this service.
Traveling and learning are increasingly popular options among those planning a gap year.
It is particularly popular among those finishing school, because they can take a gap year before university without their education suffering.
In many cases, participating in a gap year course abroad can even improve the chances of continuing higher education studies in one's own country.
Typically, a course fee is charged for participation in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent boating destination. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and on the lakes, you don't necessarily need a boat the size of a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a common leisure activity in Finland, where there is a boat for every seventh or eighth person.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most actual Baltic Sea cruises include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days and still return to the ship to sleep at night.
You do not need a separate visa if you only attend trips organized by the ship when visiting countries (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not anywhere near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
There is no reason to be ashamed of it: it is no different from the fears and disgust many other people have toward certain other things.
For some people, having some understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during a flight may help overcome fear stemming from ignorance or a sense of helplessness.
Transport companies are well-paid for fast deliveries. Often speed is very important for companies' documents, merchandise, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but on other routes and for smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they shipped the goods by air freight, the unloading and customs clearance could take days on some routes.
The only way to get the item through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so at this point, we need you.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a large wad of cash for this privilege (or perhaps preferably have your company do it for you).
However, it doesn't come cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of economy class for business class, and eleven times the price for first class!
For direct flights from place A to place B, it is generally not even worth looking for discounts for business class or first class seats.
Airlines know that there is a core group of air travelers who are willing to pay a premium to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
The conflict led to the declaration of independence of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic located in Eastern Moldova in 1994. It has its own government and currency, but no UN member state recognizes it.
Economic ties have once again formed between these two parts of Moldova, even though political negotiations have failed.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey. Its population is about 3.7 million people, it is the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling center of trade, surrounded by mountains and spreading around a vast bay.
Among the wide boulevards, glass-paneled buildings, and modern shopping centers, there are traditional red brick roofs, an 18th-century square, and old mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
Haldarsvík has an unusual octagonal church, and the village offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy.
In the churchyard, there are interesting dove sculptures on top of some headstones.
It is worth spending half an hour wandering around the fascinating village.
To the north from there and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra. Foreigners learned about it through the laudatory account written by Lord Byron, in which he described its splendor.
ScottUrb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the northern direction, it is also worth visiting the large Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which is globally famous for the apparition of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and a site that holds almost immeasurably great significance for a significant portion of the earth's population.
Many men and women who survived there and many others whose loved ones were murdered or forced to toil themselves to death there, both Jewish and non-Jewish, are still alive.
Remember to treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the area by drawing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only marked in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also commonly used in public transportation and other services.
The regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but the automatic system reports unexpected disruptions in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Although it is often merely an unfounded stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to dress as decently as possible and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-brought-up). It makes getting around considerably easier.
The rude exterior of Parisians quickly fades away if you show just ordinary courtesy.
There is a lot of forest in Plitvice National Park, mainly beeches, spruces, and pines, and its vegetation is a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to various microclimates, varying soil types, and differences in elevation.
The area is also home to an extraordinarily large number of different animal and bird species.
Alongside more common species, you can encounter rare wildlife there, such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies.
Women visiting monasteries must wear skirts that cover the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially a brightly colored one, you might get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Likewise, men need to be dressed in pants that reach below the knee.
You can borrow those from the clothing selection at the entrance as well, but they are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil and tomato along with any available side dish, such as cheese or tuna, for example.
All nouns, and additionally the word "Sie" which means "you", always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can also make reading easier, although writing is complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters C and G require the most attention because their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Remember also to pronounce r and rr differently. Caro means dear, carro means carts.
Persian grammar is quite easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help in learning many things about Persian grammar and improve the understanding of sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese is easier.
However, those who know a little Spanish might suddenly imagine that Portuguese is so similar that it wouldn't need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, old-fashioned observatories are generally not used for their original purpose, but have been converted into museums or learning environments.
Since light pollution was not the same problem during their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are vast facilities, and they are located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea was taken from China, where the most popular flower was the Japanese apricot.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom celebrations solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy within the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" as a specimen.
If you visit a formal and well-maintained garden, you'll be kicked out for collecting "samples" without any buts.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay, and it's very easy to find your way around there. You can buy almost anything after arriving.
But when you are in the heart of the tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to endure both the heat (always) and the intense sunlight (when the sky is clear, which happens less often).
Additionally, a few buses run northward to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure that the bus you intend to board actually goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to plan a holiday.
For example, a visit to the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or boating in the Erie Canal.
They also determine the routes of popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers and non-Christians from Christian countries and around the world have also adopted many traditions related to the celebration.
According to tradition, Easter night is spent awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil service on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend. The congregation often bursts into celebration at the stroke of midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island got there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because the mainland was very far away, mammals were unable to survive the journey, so the giant tortoise became the main herbivorous animal of the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in the winter, you will experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights because the sky is dark almost around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore not a problem, you can also admire the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are a common work attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or title.
Harmony in the workplace is absolutely essential. Teamwork is emphasized over personal achievements.
Employees often need to get their supervisor's approval for all the decisions they make, and they are expected to follow the supervisor's instructions without question.
