It is believed that if dinosaurs were alive today, their appearance would be quite impressive, sparking many theories and hopes. However, it is unlikely for them to fit neatly into the current ecosystem, much like a color adds complexity to a picture of three-dimensional elements.
Scientists have found that the brain structure of these insects is similar to a carrot that is split at the top.
This discovered fossil shows a significant evolutionary change.
Dinosaur feathers are believed to be multilayered and lock together to provide cover rarely worn by others. However, some dinosaur fossils show they evolved unique bone coverings called quills and barbs for a new discovery. Scientists suggest that these elaborate feathers evolved differently than other body parts.
The use of this wing shape might have been for gliding or for temperature regulation rather than for visual display. As the researchers suggest, this part of the arm, even if it belonged to a small dinosaur, the model showed a solid feathered wing instead of a thin membrane wing.
Even though the skeptics claim otherwise, if this piece of bone really belonged to a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern of its large anatomical structures is more indicative of a massive dinosaur, rather than that of a small lizard.
