The USA Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and agrees that it is absolutely necessary that the Olympic family promotes a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs can be better served if we proceed with a meaningful change in our organization, rather than if the certification is removed.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how an abuse of such proportions as so bravely described by the survivor Larry Nassar could have gone undetected for so long, and welcomes necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a secure, positive, and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked as an advisor to John F. Kennedy and subsequently for Lyndon B. Johnson's administration.
During the 1976 elections, he was a foreign policy advisor for Carter, and later served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, following Henry Kissinger.
Just like the NSA, he assisted Carter in the diplomatic handling of world issues, such as the Camp David Accords in 1978; the normalization of relations between the USA and China in the late 1970s; the Iranian revolution, which led to the hostage crisis in Iran in 1979; and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper side, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
As the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, known as a rachis, but instead have other features of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but instead for temperature regulation or display. The scientists suggested that the specimen shows an adult plumage and not chick down, although the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers believed that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not juvenile down.
A car bomb that detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun operated according to the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system was found to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
With the help of brightness and rotation, the star's Rossby number is determined, which relates to plasma flows.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the research team was looking for would be caused by forces similar to the tides of the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers succeeded in determining that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo and is made up of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he said that the new variant was 'very concerning and alarming due to the very high mortality rate.'"
Some patients may have been infected by the bacterium at the hospital, believes Doctor Moll, of which at least two were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, it seems that the proportion with XDR-TB among the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images indicate that the temperature variations between night and day likely suggest that they are caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," says Glen Cushing at the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) astrogeology team and at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral legislation codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added except for those duly counted from the eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under extensive supervision and who follow specific procedures.

In her second race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in her women's category, with a combined time of 4:41.30. It was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place held by Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place held by Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group could not finish their runs, and 45 of the total 117 participating skiers in the giant slalom did not succeed in placing in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Despite the fact that three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services cut the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the hospital at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused in Edinburgh's sheriff court of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but all eyewitness evidence may become worthless because her picture has been widely published.
This is common in other parts of the UK, but Scottish law works differently and courts have regarded the publishing of photos as potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes that "journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc. of suspects.""
The Criminal Division (Crown Office), which has the overall responsibility for prosecutions, has stated to journalists that no further comments will be made before charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document leak is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics that are said to be reported on are the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requests a ten-year constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only agrees to allow such a presence for five years.
The hunters in the supplementary pest control experiment would be closely monitored by the park rangers, as the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and culture at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting assignment received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in the span of four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former provisional election council step down as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The partially violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
There have been reports of approximately 60 cases where improperly constructed iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and inflicting minor burns on four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "mild."
The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The office of the Northern Mariana Islands' rescue service announced that no injuries have been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also announced that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later swapped places with an elderly lady because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also praised Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman.'"
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said in a comment that "Luna was as much of a freak as I was... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she is better where she is now."
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the federal election in 2010, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in the survey share this view, that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 m and 200 freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his troubles, there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the medications needed to overcome his pain as they are prohibited in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number so far, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of the water resources on Earth, along with organic material, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth was formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean that planes fly shorter distances, save millions of liters of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being deployed, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
The fear of a lack of transportation opened up the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University reported that the new species had developed in just two generations, even though this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant Espanola Darwin's finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes hue depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together. Then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space with the help of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
A giant rocket over 30 meters is required to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest contribution of the wheel has been to provide us with much easier and faster methods of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind their successes is the concept of a niche, a specific job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males together with as many as thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion acts much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar, but more like a sentence of growling, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) via scent by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on the target.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily make their way back), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs other features or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous people have not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food with the help of sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, the animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to fear, except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, which meant there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came down into the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa, or potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests had access to.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, therefore wood was very precious.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
"Even though each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland."
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words 'Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776.' The text is displayed on the underside of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (measuring 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it is likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had come to an agreement with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and in some way also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is transferred between multiple generations, a lingering cultural footprint, and a fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to impose taxes and, because there was no national executive authority or judiciary, it fell to the state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to implement all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the states before they could be added, and the states attached such little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with the German football team, is the world's second most successful team and was the champion in the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (of which the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often considered an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production and employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then rules over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the formats of image sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-millimeter format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (divide by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number relation) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS format) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It is claimed that the best placement for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European states despite their differences in languages and customs.
Its ubiquitous power influenced everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are intended for that very purpose.
The central power of the church had been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law as codified in multiple international agreements over the past two hundred years.

Because there had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most inhabitants and countries was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation from repeating in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 to start working at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each stage in China's history, or each family that held power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period where the provinces were divided. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms, which took place during the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place among many noblemen fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history when thousands of people died in the battle for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to achieve successes.
The same applies to the military, as rank within the army was now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to make a revolution.
Muhammed was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to contemplate.
the cave itself, which survived the passage of time, provides a very clear picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, which is located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is actually not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave, there is total isolation.
It is impossible to see anything other than the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid of Giza is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor deceased pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx."
The Pyramid of Cheops was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The mark for an "up-bow" looks like a V and the mark for a "down-bow" resembles a bracket or a square missing the bottom side.
Up means that you should start at the tip and move the bow upward, and down means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow downward.
An upstroke usually generates a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to add your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed bow markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister, Madam Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a member of the mob swung the head of an imperial guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses for the American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were compelled to pay tax to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street's banks.
Naturally, the large profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains from American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The era when the events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th century to the 13th century.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from technology driving development or the technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are original, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motor-driven car unconditionally leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of determinism originating from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and culture related to this geography arose, and these, which harmonized with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate around the year 400 AD and continued until approximately the year 1100 AD.
Its influence declined during the 14th century mainly due to the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was around this time that the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 12th-13th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the slow communication routes, styles in the west could, however, lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out to produce enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological, system that uses saved seeds originating from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical nature, or it can be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "wild." Some wild children have been confined by people (often their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents rejecting a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness completely on their own.
When the wild child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to those of the specific caregiver animal, such as its fear of or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is meant to make learning easier and more interesting, remedial teaching takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but support for individuals learning something new, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is intended to question, guide, and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for many different reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide secure homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster homes are intended to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they previously came from.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions regarding user theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motives for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Even 'personal engagement' and 'continuous relationships' were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial expressions that last only a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro expressions.
Oliver Sacks demonstrated in his essay "The President's Speech" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately judge sincerity.
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals like domesticated dogs.
Research during the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to satisfy its need for amino acids from the plants that are available.
In addition, a lack of this has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
For comparison, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also offers high-quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
"When all is said and done, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today."
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which makes one have to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has expanded with the path of love within Mahayana and many techniques within Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The deity yoga is central in Tibetan meditation. Through visualization of different gods, the energy channels are purified, chakras activated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to a collaboration between the Soviet Union and the USA. When the war ended, the differences in system, process, and culture caused the countries' cooperation to collapse.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years and would be physically fought through contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland and simultaneously violating the peace treaty of Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The by far most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships for transporting cargo.
The traditional job of the fleets has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to assist Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, primarily with the help of submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated first around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them for milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Tramways for carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon ways consisted only of parallel timber planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve higher speeds and haul larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron on top.
This came to be the practice, but the iron wore more on the wagons' wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first rails entirely made of iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means the upright human) first appeared.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is made with all desirable clarity that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and the problems have worsened due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After it had been adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the Speaker of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as 'Dunlap broadsides'."
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 broadsides by Dunlap that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like those of the dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open jar of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
The term beetles is used in the formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from an ancient kinship with bedbugs, insects that are sharply adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are residents, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or in their children's best interest, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. The fact is, this method is guiding in almost all research.
However, it is not alone. Experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's view on all scientific questions, including psychology, was accepted.
As knowledge of Greek decreased, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that repeats its cycle over a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the primary indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the DNA in the subject with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the subject with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited by children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to and supports, a transport system based on private car use.
Science now shows that this massive coal economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Virtually everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, one rarely hears similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because driver behaviors cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic tends to flow somewhat consistently and can largely be represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, connections have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design, and operation of facilities along the roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the most water-rich and the second longest river in the world. Its flow is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the Earth's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main channel of the Amazon River is 6,387 km. It receives its water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and construction techniques of the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed.
The Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have been aware of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had theories that they shift to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals. There are, of course, also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
That is why the pencil was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
As newer writing methods have been developed, unfortunately, the pencil has received lower status and fewer areas of use.
Today, people write messages on computer screens and never need to come close to a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that it requires energy to create a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. This made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what motivates people or what appeals to them.
The theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they want and what it is in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. On one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain "one of the gang."
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, evaluate performances, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams maintain the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to serve as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more influence than conventional team members as different time zones can affect when their team can meet, and this might not be understood by local management.
"The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
The "invisible team" is the management group that all members report to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of starting to use organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can thrive.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organizations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavior supports researchers in their studies.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that involves the behavior, learning, and intelligence of machines.
Research in AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and also recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on offering solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is now often used in finance, medicine, technology, and the military, and has been integrated into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a big part of the teaching in every class. Often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
The technology offers virtual study visit solutions. Students can look at museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state's capital; the website is redone every year, but previous versions remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, and the presence of readers generally improves this.
As students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become more aware of the world." The requirement to cater to readers' interests encourages students to be astute and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs can provide students with the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as account for their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums showcasing Canada's present and past.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and in the northern part is Muskoka's beautiful, untouched nature.
All this and more distinguishes Ontario with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are nearly uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and is its own continent in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a significant impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, thereby finding the sea route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not make it ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of knickknacks, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the central parts.
Goma is fairly safe, but if one intends to visit outside of Goma, one should investigate the situation regarding the conflicts in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places."
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border to Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each hosting different wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship among South African national parks (SANParks).
Just like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which either provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The buildings in a row that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been likened to a sparkling bar chart, enhanced by the water in Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of the buildings on Hong Kong Island are tightly packed on former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took over, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian mainland from the coast.
Sundarbans has been inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part of the forest that lies on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps — they contain some of the last remaining sites of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third consists of wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district's joint bus station (across the river) all day, but most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakara/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters up, it is 378 meters long and has two corridors that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, gatherers, and fishermen.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of India," was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the native indigenous population.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for the fact that their polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
This year's biggest tournament takes place in December on the polo fields at Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, turn to the Asociacion Argentina de polo.
The official Falklands currency is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which matches the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, it is often fine to pay with credit cards and USD.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currency may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is situated south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature seldom falls below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
However docile they may appear, bison, moose, Canadian deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
Samoa's capital is called Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the murder of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two harbors. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Nearly all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most of them offer shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-visited family beaches with a good selection of shops located by the shore. Swimming is safe.
The primary local beer is "Number one", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might handle the journey better.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
"For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is unknown. A 'short black' is 'espresso', cappuccino comes with a heap of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made year-round, and damage to the reef due to any of these causes is rare.
Still, take the authorities' advice, obey all signs, and be very attentive to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The primary habitat of the saltwater crocodile is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they usually do not live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveler security and an assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even package deals that combine flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or gather additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should first go through the travel agency, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be near where things are happening, you need to come early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as going through ice causes really awful sounds for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos often do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or clocks, and the exits are often hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and make them stay in the venue.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is going to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice, and below-freezing temperatures may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility can also be reduced by snowfall or snowstorm, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to journeys across the country to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and with standard equipment, it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
Walking safari (also known as "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of walking for either a few hours or over several days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies due to the coronavirus vary, but by the end of March, most of them do not reach as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to begin.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is at hand.
Be vigilant and do not let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, in others several minutes are required.
Filters can vary in effectiveness, and if you are unsure, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people with violence are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without tax or other surcharges at certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated primeval forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, drive sensibly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and adhering to them is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than along many other stretches, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really tasty, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those from the neighbor to the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but mighty pastries, you can try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and certain other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a collective term that includes a large variety of regional dishes spread throughout the country.
But when used without a determiner, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes, where the flavorings that the Javanese use most are peanuts, chili, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but gets a foot stuck in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders have boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that ensure a stirrup comes off the saddle if pulled backward by a rider who falls off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountain peaks offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where one glides down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard fastened to their feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5,000 B.C.!
Downhill skiing as a sport has existed at least since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being performed on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than when walking – but you will only rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control on multiple occasions.
However, the Schengen Area functions approximately like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without undergoing passport controls multiple times.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen member country. This saves you both time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limits may be shorter in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, even though they are not as old as similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is important even for many with other professions.
Historically, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they have lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities and used reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Even though it is often used, especially among non-Romani, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel restriction, your travel health insurance or cancellation protection may be affected.
You may also wish to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own residents.
For example, different circumstances may apply to American citizens in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advisory is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The image that is often presented is hasty, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available from other sources.
Extreme weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are various types of them, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfire are types and consequences of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, gusts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include intense snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may impact travel plans.
Everyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment training" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course typically goes through all the issues mentioned here but in much more detail, often with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books on how to survive in the wilderness, while books about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they possess valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a stated gender (X) or documents that are updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches during security checks have also become significantly more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 period.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the X-ray control with their integrity and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves that break off at the shore, often near a reef or similar.
The underwater topology causes the backflow to be concentrated in a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after attempting to swim back upstream, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it is no harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere you won't get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you have been detected, wait to be rescued.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there isn't as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their original culture.
Upon returning from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture's habits.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, due to the knowledge that travelers in a new country must adjust.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The sound and light story is just like a fairy tale.
The background consists of the Sphinx, which tells a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and they have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains here merge with the plateau and then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a highest peak of 4,892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice communications.
Your local telecom operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
To travel and learn is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is especially popular among recent graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually increase the chances of getting into a higher education program in your home country.
Usually a fee is charged to register for these educational programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and the lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any pleasure yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer stopover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people, regardless of age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that very many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear stemming from discomfort with the unknown or from not having control.
Courier companies are well-paid to deliver things quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, trade goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own airplanes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they have shipped items by air freight, on certain routes it may have taken several days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline rules do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and this is where you come into the picture.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a whole lot of money for the privilege (or even better, let your company do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are prepared to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably. The companies also charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is commonly spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member countries of the UN.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite failures in the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, which was historically known as Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a bustling commercial center located by a vast harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more akin to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
The cemetery has interesting marble statues of doves over some of the graves.
It is worth wandering around for half an hour in the captivating village.
Within reach to the north lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a glowing account of its grandeur by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the amazing Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), a place world-renowned for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site and a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women still alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the website with the great dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scratching graffiti on structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs, however, are only in Catalan, as it is the primary official language according to law.
However, Spanish is also used in many places in public transport and other establishments.
Regular announcements in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are communicated by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to conduct oneself in the best manner and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it considerably easier to get around.
The brusque exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show your polite side.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forest, mainly of beech, spruce, and fir, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably high species richness, due to the extent of microclimates, different soil types, and varying altitude differences.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear a skirt that covers the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide scarves to women who have not prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you'll receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the entrance store, but those garments are not washed after each person, so you might not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that in similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and consistently uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun you, are written with a capital initial letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing slightly more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can get great help learning a lot about Persian grammar and understanding sentences better if you read this basic book on grammar.
Naturally, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn’t need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are usually outdated today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not the kind of problem that it is today, they are usually found in cities or on university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the viewing of cherry blossoms, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where they used plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
"If you visit a managed garden, and you pick a "specimen", you will also get thrown out without discussion."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
"But situated in the 'high tropics' just a few degrees north of the equator, you must contend with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely)."
There are also a small number of buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives rest.
Make sure that the bus you are considering taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Internal waterways can be a good starting point to base a holiday around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a tour along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend the Easter night awake at some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be about a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend. At midnight, the congregation then breaks up to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make their way over, and therefore the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived on the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience polar nights, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
A suit is the normal business attire, and colleagues address each other with last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, where the emphasis is placed on joint efforts rather than highlighting individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain their superiors' approval for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without hesitation.
