This not only confirms the widely circulated theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the top of this animal's feathers is chestnut-colored, while the bottom is either light-colored or carotenoid-colored.
This discovery also gives us a deeper understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed central shaft (known as the "rachis"), but had other feather features (barbs and barbules), researchers infer that the rachis may have evolved from other features at a later stage.
The structure of the feathers shows that they were not used for flight but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers believe that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult dinosaur, not juvenile feathers.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult dinosaur, not those of a juvenile.

The cause of this debate is the controversy over the disaster relief and reconstruction expenses following Hurricane Katrina; some fiscal conservatives jokingly call it "Bush's New Orleans Agreement."
The criticism of the liberal party's reconstruction efforts focuses on the practice of awarding reconstruction contracts to those considered Washington insiders.

The anger of the community has led to the current drafting of policies targeting sexual content on websites with millions of publicly licensed media.
Most of the completed research is theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team is looking for is caused by the tidal gravity between the dark matter of galaxies and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon's gravity creates tides on Earth, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational force on the Sagittarius system.
Scientists can conclude that the effect of dark matter on other dark matter is the same as its effect on ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a halo-like area of the galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said this new variant is "very disturbing and worrying because its mortality rate is very high."
Dr. Mok believes that some patients may have contracted this bacteria in the hospital, and at least two of them are healthcare workers at the hospital.
Within one year, an infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among the entire group of tuberculosis patients still seems to be very low; in South Africa, at any given point in time, out of a total of 330,000 people, 6,000 are infected.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters fill in the name of their favored candidate on a pre-printed piece of paper in solitude in a voting booth, then place it into an envelope.
After the staff verifies the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The French electoral law adopts quite strict criteria to compile electoral procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting, and that no additional envelopes are added except those cast by duly verified and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the election process. In the evening, under strict supervision, volunteers count the votes according to specified procedures.

Edgar Vigila suffered injuries to his arm and chin, while Christoph Schneider required facial reconstructive surgery.
Ukha's weapon malfunctioned while pointing at the fifth person's head. Schneider continues to feel pain, is blind in one eye, has a missing piece of skull, and requires titanium to reconstruct the face.
Schneider testified via video at the U.S. Air Force base in his hometown.
Apart from the match on Wednesday, Capanneto also participated in two individual events of the championship.
Her first event was the slalom, but she was unable to complete her first run. Out of the 116 competitors, 36 had the same result in that event.
Her other competition was the giant slalom, where she ranked tenth in the women's full discipline category with a combined time of 4 minutes 41 seconds 30, 2 minutes 11 seconds 60 slower than the top-ranked Austrian competitor Claudia Loesch, and 1 minute 09 seconds 02 slower than the ninth-ranked Hungarian competitor GY Dani.
In the women's sitting category, four ski athletes were unable to finish the race, while in the giant slalom event, 45 out of a total of 117 competitors did not achieve a ranking.
The police from the central region found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested the 5 individuals who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police chief, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, stated that the defendant appeared in court with his face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, fortunately no one was injured.
However, the driver's head was severely injured.
The road at the accident scene is temporarily closed to allow emergency services to rescue the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Gorleston.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, Adekoya was charged with the murder of her son and stood trial at the Edinburgh High Court.
She is currently being detained, awaiting prosecution and trial, but because her photo has been widely circulated, the testimony of any witnesses may be affected.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's legal system is different, and the court believes that publishing the photos might constitute prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee pointed out: "It seems to be a dangerous thing if journalists publish photos of suspects or the like."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is fully responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that no further comments will be made at least before the prosecution.
According to leaked information, this document pertains to border disputes, in which Palestine hopes to use the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war as a basis.
According to reports, other topics of discussion include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan River issue.
Israel demanded that after signing the ceasefire agreement, its military should continue to be stationed in the Jordan Valley area for 10 years, while the Palestinian Authority only agreed to a 5-year stationing of Israeli forces.
Marksmen participating in the supplementary pest control trial will be closely monitored by rangers, the trial will also be supervised, and its effectiveness will be evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is collaborating with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) to recruit qualified volunteers to participate in the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage for National Parks and Wildlife Services, the four shooters selected to carry out the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to establish a temporary electoral council (CEP) composed of 9 members.
This is Martell's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of efforts to propel the country towards new elections.
This committee is Martelly's response to the massive anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
These protests were triggered by the absence of elections (with some elections not held since 2011) and sometimes even escalated into violent conflicts.
There were approximately 60 reports of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating, resulting in six fires and four people sustaining minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that the authorities have noticed twenty-seven incidents related to the device.
METI announced last week that Apple Inc. has reported another 34 overheating incidents to them, which the company considers "not serious."
The provincial department responded that Apple's postponement of the report's release is "truly regrettable."
The earthquake in Mariana occurred at the local time of 07:19 AM (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that the country has not received any damage reports.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami at that time.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took them as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists with an M16 rifle.
Some of the hostages have been rescued, with at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as a Filipino photographer, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.

During his time working at the hospital, Liggins began using his spare time to study the problem of premature births.
His research shows that taking a hormone will accelerate fetal lung development.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen and my first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons, just as unique and strong as she was."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as eccentric as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she has gone to a better place."
Among the 1,400 respondents interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
The caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election that she believes Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of respondents hold the same view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
From an extreme perspective, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three relay events of the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have led to continuous doubts about his health condition.
He has been unable to take the medication needed to overcome the pain because these medications are banned by the Olympics.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri in the United States, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
In early February, several people verified this discovery using different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic materials on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described these rumors as "political noise and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration of the United States claims that the NextGen system can shorten flight paths for aircraft, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than the outdated technology of ground radar, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided, the ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking lots or park-and-ride facilities on the ground.
Due to public concerns about a lack of transportation options, the match might be forced to take place behind closed doors without any team supporters.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that people have always believed that evolution takes a long time. However, due to interbreeding between the local Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortes) and the introduced cactus finches (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations.
Gold can be shaped into different forms and can also be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into fine threads, then twisted and braided. It can also be pressed or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made into very thin sheets and adhered to other metals. Sometimes it is even thin enough to decorate hand-painted designs in books, which is known as "illuminated manuscript decoration."
This is called the pH level of the chemical substance. You can use purple cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color change of cabbage juice depends on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substances.
The pH value indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton after removing an electron (because a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two types of dry powder evenly, then use clean, slightly damp hands to squeeze them into a ball shape.
The moisture from the hands will react with the outer layer of the material, which in turn creates a strange sensation to the touch and forms a shell-like shape.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost all houses had flush toilets connected to an advanced sewage system.
Traces of sewage treatment systems were found in the houses of Minoan towns on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, and men and women would use them together.
When you make a call to someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
After receiving the phone call, the satellite in space will almost immediately reflect it back.
The satellite is sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket needs to reach over 100 feet high to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. Its greatest contribution is providing us with simpler and faster means of transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other different types of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized felids that feed on medium-sized prey, including rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, many small feline animals (including free-ranging pet cats) will consume a variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success lies in proper division of labor, with each cat assigned a specific task, allowing them to avoid competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all the big cats, living in groups known as prides.
A pride of lions consists of one to three adult males that are related by blood, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females usually have close relationships, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides is similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs, and their behavior is surprisingly similar to lions (but different from other large cats), and all very deadly to prey.
Tigers are versatile athletes; they can climb (although not very skillfully), swim, leap long distances, and pull with a force five times that of a strong human.
Tigers and lions, leopards and jaguars all belong to the same genus (Panthera). Among the felines, only these four types are capable of roaring.
The roar of a tiger differs from the loud roar of a lion and is more like a snarling growl.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. Almost all the animals hunted by leopard cats are much smaller in size than the leopard cats themselves.
Scientists believe that leopards use their sense of smell to detect where prey was located on the ground to find animals (prey) to eat.
Their night vision capability in the dark is very high, and they can move quietly and silently. Leopard cats hunt by first blending into the environment around their prey and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a relatively small population) separates from their main parent population (for instance, by crossing a mountain range or river, or migrating to a new island, and after reaching the destination, finds it difficult to return), they often find themselves in an environment different from before.
In a new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so this new group needs to develop habits or adaptive abilities different from before in order to become stronger competitors than ever before.
The original groups have not changed at all; they still need the same adaptability as before.
Over time, this new group began to adapt to the new environment, and their differences from another group started to grow increasingly larger.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years of transformation, these two groups of organisms will look completely different and can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and is a very important part of it.
Plants release the oxygen that humans need to breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurs were the top predators of their time, so they feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are filled with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, with additional teeth on the upper jaw, which means that anything in its path cannot escape.
We are not sure, but it might have a forked tongue. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even exhibit cannibalism.
It also attacks everything in the water. Even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus rex cannot match it.
Although most of their food was similar to ours, the Romans also had their peculiar tastes and unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the rich prefer to recline together at banquets to dine.
It was impossible for ancient Roman food to include ingredients that were transported to Europe from America or Asia only in later centuries.
For example, the ancient Romans did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa beans, nor had they tasted turkey.
The Babylonians would build a main temple for each deity, which was regarded as the home of the deity.
People offer sacrifices to the deities, and priests attempt to meet the needs of the deities through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes known as pyramidal spire towers, the pyramid-shaped towers may be constructed as part of a temple.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for deities.
Due to the warm climate in the Middle East, houses become less important.
Most of the Hebrew family life takes place outdoors.
Women cook in the backyard; the shop is just an open counter facing the street. The stones are used for building houses.
Since Canaan’s territory has no large forests, timber is very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the sagas of Norse literature, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and during his westward voyage, he discovered the island and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his findings, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time.
Although each country has been "Scandinavia", the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland still have many differences.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there is a treasure map drawn on the back of the "Declaration of Independence."
However, that is not the case. Although there is some content written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the "Declaration of Independence" is inscribed with "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." This text is displayed upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, what is known is that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was stored rolled up in the early days.
Therefore, adding the symbol is likely just for labeling purposes.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but southern France remained unliberated.
It was governed by the Vichy French. These Frenchmen made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and this attack was called "Operation Dragoon."
The U.S. military and the Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks, and then turned towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together (i.e., society).
The term "文明" (civilization) originates from the Latin word civilis (meaning civil), which is related to the Latin words civis (meaning citizen) and civitas (meaning city or city-state), which to some extent also defines the scale of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture signifies the knowledge inheritance of several generations, the continuation of cultural footprints, and a certain degree of dissemination.
The cultures of minority ethnic groups often become extinct without leaving behind relevant historical evidence, and cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress as its only component.
Congress lacked any power to levy taxes. Moreover, since there were no national executive or judicial branches at the time, Congress could only rely on frequently uncooperative state governments to enforce all laws.
The Congress also has no authority to overturn the tax laws and tariffs between the various states.
The regulation requires unanimous consent from all states to be amended, but these states do not value the central government, and even state representatives often do not attend.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are tied for second in the world, and they are also the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include: soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians also participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to Japan having a group of islands, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
The origin of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name of this island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began reforming the indigenous people's grain production methods, and hired Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. This treaty ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japanese rule over the island ended only in 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, which are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of this architectural complex have been reconstructed, allowing visitors to better understand their original appearance.
Until 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35mm is the most common format for still image photography in the world and it is also the size most widely used at the end of the era of analog film photography.
Although production still continues today, more importantly, the aspect ratio of digital camera image sensors was subsequently based on it.
The name "35mm format" is a bit misleading; it is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) can thus be described as three to two.
Many common formats (such as the format of advanced photographic systems) also share the same or similar aspect ratios.
The often misused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that, while creating a sense of vibrancy, can still maintain order in an image.
It points out that the most effective position of the subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church was heavily scrutinized due to becoming wealthy and powerful.
For thousands of years, although there are still certain differences in language and customs, Christianity has nonetheless tightly linked the relationships of European countries.
Its pervasive power affects everyone, whether they are kings or commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and this is why the church's funds exist.
The central authority of the Roman Church has a history of a thousand years, and such concentrated power and money have led many people to question whether it adheres to the doctrine.
Following the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a maritime blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, but this blockade violated international law established by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom has deployed forces in international waters to prevent any vessels from entering the entire maritime area, posing a threat to neutral ships as well.
Since the response to this strategy has been limited, Germany expects its unrestricted submarine warfare to receive a similar reaction.
In the 1920s, most citizens and nations adhered to principles of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities brought about by war during World War I, countries hoped to prevent such occurrences from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and started working at Edison's company located in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in savings, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor, the manager at his previous job.
Ancient China had unique ways of signifying different periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a unique dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there were periods of instability where provinces were divided. Among these periods, the most famous is the 60 years of the Three Kingdoms period between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, many nobles engaged in fierce battles while vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people died in the quest to ascend to the highest throne of the Xian Great Palace.
Numerous social and political impacts emerged in succession, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the state belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
Additionally, after the revolution, all professions were opened up to applications from all men, allowing the most ambitious and successful individuals to succeed.
The military also has the same situation, because now military ranks are no longer linked to class, but are determined based on capability.
The French Revolution simultaneously awakened the oppressed working-class masses in other countries, initiating their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond secular life. He often went to a cave called Hira on Mount Noor (meaning "light") to meditate.
The cave formed through the test of time, giving a vivid image of Mohammed's spiritual inclination.
Resting at the top of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is isolated from the world.
In fact, even if you know it exists, it's hard to find. When you are in the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
Here, you will only see the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. Looking out from the cave, you only see and hear a small piece of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC and is one of the many large pyramids constructed to commemorate deceased pharaohs.
Located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, the Giza Plateau (also known as the "Giza Necropolis") has several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in memory of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like a V, and the "down bow" symbol resembles a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
"Upward" means you should start pushing the bow from the top, and "downward" means you should start pulling the bow from the bow grip (where your hand holds the bow).
The up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while the down-bow produces a stronger and more solid sound.
Feel free to write down your own markings, but remember that printed bowing markings are all musically justified, so generally speaking, they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Madame Élisabeth were forced by a group of market women to return from the Palace of Versailles to Paris.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd that was roaring with anger and loudly threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
A rioter suddenly waved the severed head of a royal guard in front of the frightened queen at the Palace of Versailles.
American imperialism conquered the Philippines, and the war expenses were ultimately borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, with most of the expenditures and bond interest being paid through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the excess profits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos will form the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
Before understanding the Knights Templar, we must comprehend the sequence of events that prompted its founding.
The time of that event is often considered the High Middle Ages in European history, which is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 BC - 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing various ongoing ideas, from technology-driven or technological imperatives, to the strict sense of believing that human destiny is driven by the deep logic related to scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common perspectives: the trajectory of technological development largely transcends cultural or political influences, and technology in turn exerts an inherent "influence" on society, rather than being constrained by society.
For example, someone might say that cars will inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, if there are only a few cars, a nationwide road network is not economically viable, so new production methods will be developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to more road accidents, which in turn brings about new medical technology inventions to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism element, coming from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Under the backdrop of Romanticism, the geographical environment shapes the individual, and customs and cultures related to the geographical environment emerge over time. Those cultural customs align with the structure of society, which is preferable to any arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion metropolis of feudal Europe.
Since 400 AD, it has been renowned as a center of luxury goods, continuing until around 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status gradually declined, primarily because the Crusades brought back spoils such as silk and spices, which were more popular than the goods offered in the Byzantine market.
From this time on, the title of fashion capital of Constantinople was handed over to Paris.
Gothic style reached the peak of its popularity during the 10th to 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The initial dress design was deeply influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication between the east and west, the popular styles in the west lagged 25 to 30 years behind those in the east.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style of clothing. The most significant development at that time came from the Crusades, which led people to start using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Sustainable agriculture advocates producing just enough food to feed farmers and their families.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system that uses locally retained seeds from the ecological zone, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers engaged in sustainable agriculture, and this is still common in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together individuals with common interests who feel ignored by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
The uniqueness of a subculture can stem from the age, ethnicity, class, region, and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be its language, aesthetics, religion, politics, orientation, geography, or a combination of different factors.
Members of a subculture often express their identity through unique and symbolic ways, including clothing, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite cases of a few unfortunate children who, due to being neglected, encountering misfortunes, or being deliberately abused during their development, have not received the social education from adults.
These children are generally referred to as "feral children." Some feral children were confined by people (usually their parents), while in other cases, they were abandoned because their parents refused to accept their severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Before being abandoned or running away from home, wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma.
Some people are said to have been raised by animals, while others survived alone in the wild.
When a wild child is raised by non-human animals, their behavior (within physical limitations) is almost entirely similar to that of the animals that care for them, such as feeling fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, and the scaffolding theory goes even further.
Scaffolding theory is not a learning method but rather a form of support that assists individuals who are experiencing a new learning process, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual, or it can be real. In other words, a teacher can be a form of scaffolding, and the Clippy in Microsoft Office can also be a form.
The virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software to prompt, stimulate, and explain procedures that students find difficult to handle independently.
There are many reasons why a child is placed in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking care, love, and education, but these children are experiencing all of this.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system will provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide everything that was lacking in their previous home.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet have expanded the scope of usage and ways of fulfillment.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
In their 1998 study on users' responses to websites, Eighmey and McCord identified "personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" as new motivations.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting fleeting microexpressions and facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that accurately interpreting micro-expressions can allow one to detect whether a person is lying.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out that even people who are unable to understand the content of a speech due to brain damage can still accurately judge the speaker's sincerity.
He even suggested that domestic dogs and other animals might also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century shows that genetic variation is divided into two types: recessive and dominant.
Mutations introduce new genetic variations and selectively remove dominant variations from the gene pool.
Separation and recombination occur back and forth in the gene pools of both sets of each generation.
On the savannah, primates (whose digestive systems are similar to those of humans) find it difficult to obtain the necessary amino acids from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure can lead to serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and even ultimately result in death.
The most easily obtainable plant resources are proteins derived from leafy or leguminous plants, but if these plants are not cooked, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
After considering all of this, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a manner similar to the chimpanzees on today's savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and then falling back into sleep within a short period of time (ten to sixty minutes).
As long as you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that lets you become conscious without fully waking you up, it can be easily achieved.
If you tend to reset your alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get up to turn it off.
Other biologically rhythmic choices include drinking large amounts of fluids before sleeping (especially water or tea known to be diuretic), forcing one to get up to urinate.
The inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the physical and mental tension of an individual.
The less nervous you are, the more positive energy your life will exhibit. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of enlightenment. The only thing hindering progress toward this goal is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but through the Mahayana Buddhism's compassion and various techniques originating from Indian yoga, it has been widely spread.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to great compassion.
Kundalini Yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing various deities, it purifies the energy channels, opens the chakras, and generates an awakened consciousness.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which prompted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, conflicts in systems, processes, and culture between the two countries led to discord.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies, and the Cold War has officially begun.
It will continue for the next forty years, with proxy armies fighting real wars on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invading eastern Poland, entering and establishing the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Utilizing maritime transport is temporarily the most effective method for transoceanic conveyance of large populations and goods.
The traditional duty of the navy is to ensure that your country has the ability to transport its citizens and goods, while disrupting the enemy’s ability to transport their citizens and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The United States attempted to cross the Atlantic to transport manpower and supplies to assist the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the German Navy mainly used U-boats to attempt to stop the transportation.
If the Allies fail, Germany might conquer Britain just as it had previously conquered other European countries.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats are usually herded in groups on hills or other pastures, tended by shepherds who are typically children or teenagers, similar to the shepherds we are more familiar with. These herding methods are still in use today.
England had already built carriageways as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage roads were only made of parallel wooden planks, compared to the somewhat rougher roads of the time, they enabled horses to go faster and pull heavier loads.
The use of sleepers to secure rails was introduced very early. However, gradually people discovered that adding a small amount of iron to the surface of the rails was more effective.
This evolved into a common practice, but iron would cause greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. All-iron tracks were first introduced in 1767.
The earliest known mode of transportation was walking. With the appearance of Homo erectus (referring to the upright-standing people), humans began walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
The specialized form of bipedal animals was found among Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can participate in environmental movements, and even become activists to some extent to reduce harm to the future.
This is just like prescribing the right medicine for many situations. However, if we don't just want to solve the problem temporarily, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it from the source.
Obviously, with the ever-advancing human technology and techniques, the world has been completely transformed. Due to overpopulation and the overly extravagant lifestyles of humans, the problem has become more severe.
After the bill was passed by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was subsequently sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located several blocks away.
Made 150 to 200 copies throughout the night, now known as the "Dunlap Broadside."
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon in the front yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy was sent to London on August 10.
The 25 known existing Dunlap broadside copies are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten manuscript no longer exists.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived to the present day. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people do not consider them dinosaurs.
However, there are still many things about birds that remain similar to dinosaurs.
Their feet have scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a tyrannosaurus.
Nowadays, almost all computers in use are based on manipulating information, and the encoding of information is in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer terminology.
Internal organ poisoning may not manifest immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are very common and do not allow for immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious signs of internal poisoning may be opened medicine containers or toxic household chemicals left at the scene.
Check the label of specific poisons for designated first aid instructions.
The term "bug" used by entomologists, in a formal sense, refers to this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, an insect highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs are both nidicolous animals, accustomed to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple might think that raising a baby is not in their best interest, or not in the child's best interest.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through scientific methods. In reality, this approach indeed guides most scientific research.
Conducting experiments is not the only method; an experiment is merely a test used to rule out one or more feasible hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations can equally guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers emphasize classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, are widely recognized.
As Greek knowledge declined, the Western world disengaged from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
The rhythms observed in many physiological and behavioral aspects are usually primarily determined by the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through the biological clock.
Rhythmic cycles are not only responses to external periodic cues but are also recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator, which will continue to run its natural cycle for a period of time even without external cues.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase is one of the crucial proposals that suggests DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one labeled the DNA in bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus, and the other labeled the proteins in bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of a mutation can vary depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only variations in the germline cells can be inherited by children, while other variations may lead to cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature allows the appreciation of scenery, including wildlife, and holds great appeal for nature enthusiasts.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying information related to ecosystems.
One example is touring, photographing, and learning about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to their workplaces, brushing past those whose work destinations are exactly the places they just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is, to some extent, connected and supporting the transportation system with private vehicles.
Modern science indicates that this large-scale carbon economy has pushed the biosphere away from a stable state, which has been the pillar of human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
You seldom hear complaints of a similar magnitude about water quality or bridge collapses in developed countries.
Why does the transportation system lead to complaints? Why is there a malfunction every day? Are the traffic engineers so incompetent? Or is it because there are some more fundamental issues?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and interact with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow research is not easy because we cannot accurately predict drivers' behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior tends to be within a reasonable and stable range; therefore, the traffic flow tends to have a certain reasonable consistency and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships among three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky. Their ability to fly helps them evade predators more easily, as well as find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backward along their bodies.
This allows them to reach more tiny places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many believe the opposite is true, that the solar system (including the sun, and even other celestial bodies) revolves around the Earth.
It seems reasonable since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
Of all the water that flows from rivers into the sea on Earth, as much as 20% comes from the Amazon.
The main channel of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small streams.
Even though the construction of pyramids using stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, the scale and advanced construction techniques of the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period marveled at the monuments from over a millennium ago of the preceding period.
Vatican City's population is about 800 people. It is the smallest and least populous independent country in the world.
The official language of communication and law in Vatican City is Italian.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people working in that country, while Latin is more commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens within Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can be found in nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the four elements. Those four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
These are more like the four states of matter (arranged in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, his theory also points out that the different states of these elements can transform into new substances, forming the things we see in front of us.
An alloy is essentially a mixture composed of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many more elements on the periodic table.
Calcium and potassium, among other elements, are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals as well, such as silver and gold.
There are also some alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is extremely tiny; so small that the period of this sentence can accommodate trillions of atoms.
Therefore, when the pencil was introduced, many people considered it a good friend.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and frequency of use of pencils have decreased.
People now type messages on computer screens and no longer need pencil sharpeners.
People can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when newer things appear.
The operating principle of a fission bomb is that it requires energy to combine nuclei with many protons and neutrons together.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again and then releasing some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to split even with very slight vibrations or no vibrations at all.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The front side of the crust is about 70 kilometers thick, and the back side is 100 kilometers thick.
The crust under the lunar seas is thinner, while beneath the high ground it is thicker.
Due to the thinner crust, the near side may have more lunar maria, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying the reasons why humans do certain things or how their interest may be sparked.
These theories suggest that in the process of growing into adults, certain needs and/or desires become internalized.
These theories explore what it means for certain people to desire to do certain things, and what factors in their environment lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager begins leading their former peers, two behaviors may emerge. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the team."
Managers of this type often have difficulty when making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning work responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum is the manager turning into a completely different person, who would feel it necessary to change everything constant in the team and take full responsibility themselves.
After all, the leader must ultimately be responsible for the team's success or failure.
This kind of behavior can sometimes lead to disagreements between the leader and other team members.
Virtual teams must adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are still slight differences between the two.
The function of virtual team members is often to serve as a liaison point for their immediate physical group.
Because their team can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by management in various locations, they often have greater autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why are organizations willing to spend time becoming learning organizations? One of the objectives of practicing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are fully utilized by the functional departments within the organization, creativity and uniqueness will be elevated.
Ultimately, the process of internal cooperation within the institution to overcome challenges can lead to an innovative process of serving the needs of customers.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must establish a culture of innovation and promote knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angie (2006) explained that the continuous method is used to help organizations improve performance.
The data from neurobiology provides physical evidence for the theoretical approaches to cognitive research, thereby narrowing its scope and making it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior has confirmed the scientists' research.
A long time ago, people already knew that different types of brain injuries, traumas, damages, and tumors could affect behavior and lead to changes in some psychological functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to observe and study previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides a lot of information and materials for us to build a simulated model to help us understand how the brain works.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it still constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptability.
The research of artificial intelligence involves automating tasks that require intelligent behavior by machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnostics and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial recognition.
The aforementioned items have now become separate independent fields, focused on providing solutions to problems encountered in real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and have been integrated into some home computer and electronic game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of all education. Teachers often want to take students to places that buses cannot directly reach for inspections.
Technology provides virtual field trip solutions. Students can explore museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful artworks while sitting comfortably in the classroom.
Virtual field trips are also a good method for reflecting on and sharing experiences from field trips in future teaching.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital every year. The website is updated annually, but the old versions are also kept online as a memento.
Blogs can also enhance students' writing skills. When students initially start writing blogs, they usually have grammatical and spelling mistakes, but the presence of readers generally changes this.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, bloggers will strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, the blog "Enhancing students' understanding of their surroundings" meets the readers' interests by inspiring students to become smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools for inspiring student collaboration outside of school and encouraging students to extend their learning beyond traditional school days.
Proper use of blogs "can enhance students' analytical skills and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their own positions based on the meaning of others' articles and outline their views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, featuring a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, while heading north are the undeveloped natural beauties of the Muskoka River and others.
All of this highlights Ontario even more and is regarded by outsiders as a typical Canadian place.
Most parts of the northern region are sparsely populated, with some areas even being uninhabited wilderness.
This is a surprising population comparison for many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest continent and also a habitat for wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are also known for luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land and carried out large-scale occupation in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism originated in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope to India.
The northern region is surrounded by the Sahara, while the south and west are surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that any female traveler, regardless of marital status, should say she is married.
Wearing a ring can also help (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should understand that certain cultural differences may lead to incidents perceived as harassment, such as being followed or having their arm grabbed, which are quite common.
When rejecting a man, your attitude must be firm, and don't be afraid to express your stance (cultural differences are not an excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Bayda, where Spanish merchants established a trading base and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places near the old medina selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various trinkets, but they are all targeted at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo. The volcanic lava covered most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is quite safe, you should conduct research before visiting any place outside of Goma to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and it offers the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking service in Africa.
You can tour Goma by taking a Boda-boda motorcycle taxi. The normal (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese Francs.
Additionally, due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for distant exoticism.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished town, but its historical fame has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to the desert sandstorms, this place was listed as an endangered World Heritage site.
Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World" lists this place as one of the major stops.
This city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, as it has a more Arab atmosphere compared to African cities.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into fourteen different ecological zones, each providing habitat for different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is regarded as the flagship park of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation and park entry fee.
If you buy a Wild Card, it also has benefits, as it can grant you access to designated South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with Hong Kong and is also a focal point for many tourists.
The numerous skyscrapers that make up Hong Kong's skyline resemble a shimmering bar chart, appearing exceptionally striking against the waters of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the most beautiful scenery of Hong Kong, leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This place was once occupied by British colonizers, making it a good starting point for finding evidence of colonial history on this territory.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland to Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarban has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The forest located within India is known as Sundarban National Park.
However, the forests here are not only mangrove swamps; they also include the last remnant of the huge jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The area of Sudaban is 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water/swamp area.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses are available around the clock from the district bus station (across the river), but most departures are concentrated between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumthang.
Due to inter-district buses often being fully booked, it is recommended to purchase tickets several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster shuttle buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to reach nearby locations, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The twin towers are 83 meters tall, the bridge is 378 meters long, and there are two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011, but did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is completed.
The Guarani people live in present-day eastern Paraguay and are the largest indigenous group in the area. They live a semi-nomadic lifestyle as hunters and also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco area is home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua. They live by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Province of the Giant Indians," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has consistently managed to retain much of its native characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest championship of the year takes place in December at the La Canitas polo field.
The rest of the year, you can also enjoy watching smaller championships and competitions.
For information about the match and where to purchase tickets for the polo match, please refer to the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is set to be equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
You can use British pounds everywhere on the island, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are usually accepted.
Credit cards are usually not accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currency might be accepted; it is advisable to confirm the acceptable payment methods with the shop owner in advance.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so you should exchange currency before leaving.
As Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures exceeding thirty degrees Celsius are quite common.
Winter may be mistakenly thought to be very cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but combined with the wind and humidity, it feels colder than what the thermometer shows.
There is no specific "rainy season" and "dry season" there: the annual rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
There are many animals in the park that are accustomed to seeing humans, but these wild animals still retain their wild nature and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park regulations, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem on the outside, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can potentially attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they do not maintain an appropriate distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please keep your distance from them.
In addition, please be aware that smells can attract bears or other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented food, and keep the campsite tidy.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom all refused to leave the harbor.
Except for one British cruiser, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence in the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the death of Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland spanning two harbors, there are many beaches in this area. The most popular beaches are located in three regions.
North Shore Beach (Beigang District) is located on the Pacific Ocean, extending from the northern Changwan to the southern Devonport.
Almost all of the beaches here are suitable for swimming, and most have New Zealand Christmas trees providing shade.
Tamaki Drive beach is at Waitematā Harbour, located in the upscale Auckland neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
This place is very popular with family swimmers and can be quite crowded at times, with many shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One." It is not a complex beer, but it gives a pleasant and refreshing feeling. Another local beer is called "Manta."
You can buy a lot of French wine here, but those from New Zealand and Australia may be shipped better.
The local tap water is very safe and drinkable. However, if you're concerned, it's also very easy to find bottled water.
To Australians, "white" coffee is a foreign concept. A short black coffee is an "espresso," cappuccino has a lot of cream (not milk froth), and tea is without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juice is expensive, its quality is excellent.
All year round, many people travel to the coral reefs. However, on the coral reefs, injuries due to any of the aforementioned reasons are very rare.
Nevertheless, it is still important to heed the authorities' advice, comply with all signs, and closely pay attention to safety warnings.
From October 1770 to April, box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths. Outside of this period, they can occasionally be found.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away on their own.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean. Their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can provide travelers with accommodation upon arrival at their destination, giving them peace of mind.
Travel agencies usually have partnerships with specific hotels, but you can also book campsites and other types of accommodations through them.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, round-trip airport transfers, and even combinations of flights and hotels.
If you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (such as a visa), they can also hold the reservation for you.
Any modifications or requests should first be made through the travel agency rather than directly with the hotel.
At some music festivals, most of the attendees choose to camp on-site, and they all consider it a necessary part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the event location, you should arrive early to find a campsite close to the music.
Remember, even though the music on the main stage may have ended, some parts of the festival might still be playing music into the late night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If traveling across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, the location of the cabin needs to be checked because when crossing the icy sea, the cabins most affected will have terrible noise.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers may be exempt from visa requirements (for details, please refer to the terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are typically no windows and clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment arrangements to keep guests in good spirits and staying inside the casino.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is lower, and you cannot drive in the same way as on regular asphalt roads.
In a blizzard, snowfall in a very short period of time is enough to trap you.
Visibility may be limited due to snow or blowing snow, or the car window glass fogging or icing.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are very common in many countries, and traffic is hardly ever disrupted throughout the year.
A hunting safari may be the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and is also the itinerary most anticipated by many travelers.
The term "safari" generally refers to a journey overland to observe the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) like to approach cars, and you can see them clearly with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, leopards, and cheetahs are relatively shy, and using binoculars makes it easier to see them.
Hiking trips (also known as "jungle walks," "hunting treks," or "walking") can include hikes that last for several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other areas within Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, with the last time being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you might find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not include July 2020 (the original time for the Olympics).
The ticket prices for most events are expected to range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price being about 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels will lend you an iron and ironing board even if the room doesn't have one.
If there's no iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are many different methods for purifying water on the market, some of which can effectively counter specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other places, several minutes are required.
The effectiveness of filters varies; if you have any concerns, you might consider purchasing sealed bottled water produced by a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animals and pests that are not commonly seen in their hometown.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people with their strength, usually do not meet the criteria to become pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the purchase of tax-free goods at specific locations.
In heavily taxed countries, travelers can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
On the section of road between Marion Point and Fairmont, the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway presents the most challenging driving environment, frequently traversing the terrain of remote and isolated areas.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, please stay alert: there are mainly steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns here.
The legal speed limit is noticeably lower than the preceding and following sections, usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), and strictly adhering to the speed limit is more important than other matters.
However, the strange thing is that the cell service signal here is much stronger than many other sections along the way, such as the wilderness of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are very delicious, and Bavarian pastries are similar to those of their southern neighbor Austria, with a very rich and diverse variety.
Fruit pastries are very common, with apple pastries seen throughout the year, while cherries and plums are regulars in the summer.
Many German baked goods are also made with almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. A popular cake paired with a cup of rich coffee is usually an excellent combination.
If you want to try some small and delicious pastries, you can try a Berliner jam bun, which might also be called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, cheese is a common ingredient in curry; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, people generally use coconut milk.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands to choose from, and Indonesian food is a general term that covers a wide variety of local cuisines from all over the country.
However, without further modifiers, the term tends to be interpreted as food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine can be found everywhere in the archipelago, including a range of simply seasoned dishes. The main seasonings favored by Javanese people are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
A stirrup is a support for the rider's foot, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but there is also a safety risk as the rider's foot might get stuck inside.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but one foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse runs off, they may be dragged. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most of the riding boots worn by riders have heels and smooth, relatively narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles (especially English saddles) are equipped with safety bars, which allow the rider to pull back when falling, and the stirrup leather will come off the saddle.
The top climbing spot in Chile – Cochamó Valley, also known as the Yosemite of South America, features various massive granite walls and cliffs.
The scenery of the mountain peaks is breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world continuously develop new routes along the valley's endless rock walls.

Skiing is a major tourist activity, and there are many enthusiasts (sometimes referred to as "skiing fanatics") who plan their entire holidays around skiing in specific locations.
The concept of skiing is very ancient—the cave paintings depicting skiers can be traced back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
Although related to alpine-style ski tourism or mountaineering, most do not involve it. The latter takes place on steep slopes and requires harder skis and boots.
Think of ski trails as similar to hiking trails.
Under good conditions, your skiing range can be farther than the distance of walking. However, in very rare circumstances, you can achieve cross-country skiing speed without having to carry a heavy backpack while gliding on well-maintained tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Generally, traveling to multiple countries means having to obtain visas multiple times and going through passport checks multiple times.
However, the way the Shen Gen area operates in this regard is like a country.
As long as you stay within the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Boundary Zone, usually you do not need to go through passport control when crossing the border.
Similarly, as long as you have a Shengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member country one by one, thus saving time, money, and reducing paperwork.
There is no unified definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define items that are over a hundred years old as antiques.
This definition has regional differences, and the age restriction for antiques in places like North America may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be classified as antiques, although they are younger than mass-produced products of the same kind.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture of reindeer trading is also very important to many other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami people participated in large-scale reindeer herding. Instead, they relied on fishing, hunting, and similar activities for livelihood, with reindeer primarily used as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people engage in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used (especially by non-Romani people), it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting has a travel warning issued, your travel medical insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
Besides referring to the recommendations of your own country's government, you can also refer to the advice of other countries' governments, but their recommendations are often designed for their own citizens.
To cite an example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advisory is merely a simple overview of a country's political situation.
Compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere, the recommendations presented here are relatively rough, vague, and overly concise.
Adverse weather is a general term referring to any dangerous weather phenomena that may cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Inclement weather can occur anywhere in the world, with different types that may depend on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and impacts of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Strongly advise travelers to be aware of any risks brought about by severe weather affecting their area, as these may impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone must undergo professional training first.
Searching the internet for "Hostile Environment Course" may provide the addresses of local companies.
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here, with detailed analysis and typically includes practical experience.
A course generally lasts 2 - 5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid training, and some weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are very common, but there are very few that mention war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry the necessary valid documents for their return.
Different countries have varying willingness in issuing passports without specifying gender (X) or updating documents to match the required name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to implement these documents varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, the searches at security checkpoints have become more intrusive.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to maintain their privacy and dignity when passing through scanners.
A rip current is the backflow of waves impacting the beach, usually occurring at places like reefs or similar areas.
Due to the underwater topographic return flow being concentrated in some deeper parts, the rapid currents towards deep water may originate from this.
Most of the fatal cases are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, an attempt that is unlikely to succeed.
Once you break away from the current, swimming back is as simple as usual.
When you still haven't been found, try looking in other places, but it also depends on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, because you might want to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning to the workplace comes faster than cultural shock (the honeymoon period is shorter). It lasts longer and can also be more severe.
Travelers who once easily adapted to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
When you first go abroad, people may show patience and understanding because they know that travelers need to adjust in a new country.
People might not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
For the children, the pyramids' sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can view the pyramids in the dark and admire them in silence before the performance begins.
Usually, you always hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Display scenes on the pyramid, and different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are currently claimed by several countries, and they have the highest number of bases on the islands, with 16 operational bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is the location of the town of Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still active volcanic crater has been flooded to form a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, and it is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountain ranges merge into the plateau and then emerge into the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern or Sentinel Range holds Antarctica's highest mountain range, known as the Vinson Massif, with its peak, Mount Vinson, at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Satellite phones generally cannot replace mobile phones because you must be outdoors with an unobstructed line to the satellite to make a call.
This type of service is frequently used in shipping, including yachts, and for expeditions with long-range data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, traveling and learning are increasingly popular choices.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before going to college without affecting their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year program abroad can actually enhance your chances of receiving higher education in your own country.
Generally speaking, attending these educational courses requires paying tuition fees.
Finland is very suitable for rowing. This "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
A yacht is not necessary for touring islands and lakes.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lake can accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even canoes can provide a different experience.
Rowing is a very common pastime for Finns, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
There are similar situations in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but compared to other countries, Finland is very unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one in forty).
Most distinctive Baltic cruises make longer stops in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can have a full two days to visit this historic city and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
As of 2009, if you are only disembarking for tourism purposes, you will not need an additional visa.
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and tours of the city are not included in the price of the cruise.
For people of any age and background, flying can be a frightening experience, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding the principles of how airplanes work and what happens during the flight process may help overcome a fear based on the unknown or the uncontrollable.
The courier company is richly rewarded for delivering items quickly. For business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs, time is often of the essence.
On some routes, big companies have their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies face problems.
If they transport goods by plane, it may take several days on some routes to unload and clear customs.
The fastest way is to send it as checked luggage. The airline's policy states that luggage cannot be transported without a passenger, which is exactly where you come in.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a lot of money to enjoy this privilege (a better way is to have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: based on a rough estimate, you can expect business class fares to be about four times the cost of regular economy class, and first-class fares to be 11 times as much!
Generally speaking, it is pointless to look for deals on business or first-class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Since airlines are well aware that some core passengers are willing to pay high fees for the privilege of arriving comfortably and quickly at their destination, they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the emergence of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but has not been recognized by any United Nations member states.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been reestablished.
The main religion of Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

Please treat this venue with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the venue, write on, or graffiti the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand Catalan, and almost everyone understands Spanish.
However, most signage is only in Catalan, because Catalan is legally designated as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used on public transportation and other facilities.
The regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by the automated broadcast system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to interact with people in Paris is still to show your best side, like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will make the visit much easier.
If you show some basic courtesy, the Parisians' rude exterior will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, primarily with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying elevations, there is clearly a particularly high diversity of plant communities.
This area is also home to a wide variety of animals and birds.
In this area, you can find rare animal groups such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, as well as many common species.
When visiting the monastery, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries offer scarves to unprepared women, but if you bring your own scarf, especially a bright-colored one, the monk or nun at the entrance will greet you with a smile.
Meanwhile, gentlemen must wear knee-length pants.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca is similar to that of the Mediterranean, focusing on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and makes extensive use of olive oil.
Pa amb Oli is a simple and popular dinner especially favored in the summer: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns used with "Sie" must be capitalized, even when in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method to distinguish between verbs and objects.
It can also be said that this makes it easier to read, even though writing is somewhat complex, because it is necessary to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
The pronunciation of Italian is relatively easy because most of the words are pronounced as they are written.
Pay attention to the main letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes based on the following vowels.
Additionally, ensure that the pronunciation of r and rr is different: caro means dear, while carro represents a two-wheeled carriage.
The grammar of Persian is relatively simple and generally regular.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book can help you learn more Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Of course, if you understand a Romance language, then learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, someone who only knows a little Spanish might carelessly conclude that it is not necessary to learn Portuguese separately, as they are very similar.
Pre-modern observatories are usually abandoned today and preserved as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not as severe during their heyday as it is now, they are usually located in cities or campuses and are more accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China. There, people choose to appreciate plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom party near the Imperial Palace was held by the Emperor for himself and other members of the royal family.
Plants only look beautiful when they grow in a natural environment, so you need to resist the temptation of thinking it's okay to "just take a little" as a specimen.
If you visit a meticulously arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will definitely lead to expulsion, with no room for discussion.
Singapore is typically a very safe place and is very easy to navigate. You can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But Singapore is located a few degrees north of the equator in the "high tropical region," and you need to get used to the (frequent) hot weather and the intense sun (which is less encountered when the weather is clear).
There are still a few buses heading north to Hebron, which is the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives.
Please ensure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and its purpose is to celebrate the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this festival are also embraced by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of waking up at some time on Easter night to watch the sunrise.
Of course, Christian theology can explain the origin of this tradition, but it is likely a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
More traditional churches usually hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with the congregation typically entering into celebrations suddenly when the midnight bell rings, commemorating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first came to the island did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals are unable to travel long distances, making giant tortoises the primary grazing animals of the Galápagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, they have introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a great opportunity to view the aurora because the sky will be in darkness for twenty-four hours.
Due to the sparse population in these areas, light pollution is usually not a problem, and you can also enjoy the stars.
Compared to the workplace culture commonly practiced in the West, Japan's workplace culture is more hierarchical and more formal.
Suits are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or titles.
Harmonious workplace relationships are extremely important, emphasizing team efforts and outcomes rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees must obtain approval from their superiors before making any decisions and are expected to comply with their superiors' instructions without question.
