This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but it also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and with a pale or carotenoid color below.
The discovery also demonstrates how bird feathers have evolved.
Since dinosaur feathers have an underdeveloped feather shaft but possess other feather features – barbs and barbules – scientists concluded that the feather shaft likely developed later in the evolutionary process.
The composition of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or appearance. Researchers suggested that despite this being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers rather than downy feathers.
Researchers concluded that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers instead of chick down.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning. Two police officers died and more than twenty others were injured.

Their conclusion was that the sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: All stellar activity in the system turned out to be determined by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly of a theoretical nature, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the Bowman's Galaxy.
The effects the team was looking for originated from the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
The Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy just as the moon pulls on the Earth and causes tides.
The scientists concluded that dark matter affected other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is situated around it as some kind of halo and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered an extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis bacterium (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that he considered the new variant to be "very difficult to deal with and extremely dangerous due to its high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the infection at the hospital, believes Dr. Moll, and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected individual can infect about 10 to 15 people if they come into close contact with them.
The percentage of XDR-TB among all groups of tuberculosis patients, however, still seems to be very low, or 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 patients who were infected during a certain period in South Africa.

The epidemic has prompted Indian authorities to implement such measures, for example, the distribution of pig trappers in severely affected areas, the distribution of thousands of mosquito nets, and the spraying of insecticides.
The authorities have also promised several million vials of vaccine against meningitis. It will help healthcare institutions in preparation for the next year.
Plans for vaccine distribution in the areas that have historically been most affected this year were delayed due to lack of funding and lower prioritization compared to other diseases.

Infrared photographs revealed variable temperatures during night and day, and therefore it likely involves caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the US Geological Survey (USGS), a team in the field of astrogeology and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Elections in France have generally not been very technical: voters step aside into a voting booth, mark the appropriate candidate on a printed sheet, and then put it in an envelope.
Once the officials have confirmed the voter's identity, the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French election laws detail the process quite thoroughly.
Since 1998, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the voting process and that no envelopes are added except from recognized voters.
Candidates are allowed to send representatives to observe the entire process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision in accordance with specified procedures.

In the other competition, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind Claudia Loesch from Austria who finished in first place and 1:09.02 minutes behind Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary who finished in ninth place.
Four female skiers in the women's sitting category did not finish, and 45 out of a total of 117 competitors in the giant slalom did not qualify in the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered a computer and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Chief Inspector D K Arya said: "We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Assistant Chief of Police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, reported that the accused had attended the court proceedings with their face covered.
Despite three people being inside when the car was driven into the house, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was then brought before the Edinburgh district court charged with murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting formal charges and trial. However, the testimony of those who were present might be compromised because her picture has been shown in many places.
This is standard practice elsewhere in the UK, but justice does not work like that within Scotland. Courts view the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, points out that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous path by publishing images, etc., of suspected individuals."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, has told journalists that nothing more will be disclosed at least until a formal charge is made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants to base on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other subjects discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issues of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that the military remain in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, whereas Palestinian authorities only want the military to be in the area for five years.
The shooters in the extermination test were to be under close supervision by the rangers, as the test was monitored and its success evaluated.
The collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) led to the recruitment of skilled volunteers for the hunting program of the sporting shooters' association.
The four shooters chosen to participate in the shooting expedition were given detailed guidance on safety and training, according to Mick O'Flynn, acting executive director of the agency for national park protection and cultural heritage at NPWS.
Martelly yesterday inaugurated nine members of the provisional electoral council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the presidential committee recommended that the CEP step down as part of a package of actions to move the country toward new elections.
The appointed committee was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the authorities that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, started because elections were not held; certain elections were supposed to take place in 2011.
Around 60 cases have been reported of defective iPods that overheated and resulted in a total of six fires where four people sustained minor burn injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 incidents of overheating to the company, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay on the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Office in the Northern Marianas said that no domestic damage had been reported.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former police officer in the Philippines took tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their tour bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and it is confirmed that at least 6 people have died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly citizens, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the position of an elderly woman as she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins did the same as his father and began a career in the field of medicine.
He specialized in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he worked at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His research revealed that the administration of hormones accelerated fetal lung development.
Xinhua announced that government investigators had found two 'black boxes'/flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also honored Luna's memory.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said: "Luna was as crazy as I am ... even crazier ... love her and will miss her ... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people who were asked before the federal elections in 2010, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by about 8 percent since 2008.
The Prime Minister Julia Gillard was quoted during the 2010 election campaign as saying that she believed a republic should be established in Australia when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
34% of those who responded to the survey are of the same opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the most decisive options of the survey, 29 percent of participants wanted Australia to be converted into a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent felt that a republic should never be established in Australia.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness has been called into question.
He has not been able to take the medication that is supposed to relieve the pain because they are banned at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number today, January 25.
Several parties confirmed the discovery with different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could possibly have transported water to Earth along with organic compounds that can form proteins and be a source of life.
Scientists carry with them the hope of gaining an understanding of how planets are formed, especially how the Earth came into being, but comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said that the rumor was "political nonsense and foolishness".
It is believed that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims allows aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to find the location of aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be added and trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and facilities for parking are unavailable on site.
Concerns over the lack of transportation raised questions about whether the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published last Thursday in the journal Science discussed the evolution of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands.
Scholars at the American Princeton University and the Swedish Uppsala University reported that the new species had evolved in only two generations, previously it was believed that the process would take much longer due to breeding between the indigenous Darwin's finch, Geospiza seildyra, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in all kinds of ways. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire which can be twisted and braided together. It can be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
The material can be diluted significantly and applied to other metals. The material can be diluted so much that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called pH chemistry. You can make an indicator with juice from red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the substance is.
The acidity is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test sample.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry ingredients together, then shape them into a ball with clean and wet hands.
Moisture on the hands will affect the outer layers, which works a bit strangely and forms a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water toilets in almost every house, which were connected to an advanced sewage system.
Ruins of sewage systems have been found in the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were mixed together.
When someone thousands of kilometers away is called, a satellite is used.
The satellite receives the call and reflects it almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts light and our view.
A giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall must be used to send a satellite or space telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the bicycle has done for us is to provide us with much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, automobiles, and other means of transport of various kinds.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are also many small felines (including pet cats) that eat quite a bit more of small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind their success is the idea of a niche, a specific task that each cat is responsible for, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of the cat species and live in large groups called prides.
Groups consist of 1-3 adult males along with up to 30 females and young.
The female animals are usually closely related to each other, being a large family composed of sisters and daughters.
Lion groups behave in a similar way to groups of wolves or dogs. There are animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior and also very deadly towards their prey.
The versatile body structure of a tiger enables it to climb (not particularly well though), swim, jump far, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather resembles a sentence with growling, shouted words.
Leopard cats often eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all animals that leopard cats hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that leopards track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent and by sniffing where they have walked on the ground.
They have night vision and see very well in the dark, and their movements are stealthy. Panthers hunt their prey by blending into their environment and then making a swift attack on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to another island making it difficult to return), the environment often turns out to be different from what they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors. The new residents therefore need different characteristics or adaptability to be strong competitors compared to what was before.
The original inhabitants have not changed at all. They still have the same need for adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other residents.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have become so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
This is called speciation, which simply means that a new species is formed. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and they absorb carbon dioxide which people breathe out.
Plants create their food by using the sun and photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Animals could not live without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time. She feared no one, except for other mosasaurs.
The long snout contained more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra row of teeth at the top of the palate, and thus nothing that crossed her path escaped.
It is not certain, but she may have had a split tongue. She ate turtles, large fish, and like other mosasaur lizards, she may have engaged in cannibalism.
She also attacked everything that came into the water, even the largest dinosaurs such as the spinosaurus were no match for her.
Although we were familiar with most of their food, the Romans also had some unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the wife ate sitting in chairs while the rich men held feasts together and reclined as they consumed their food.
Meals of the ancient Romans could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, there was no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the gods' needs with rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary into which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not considered very important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their lives under the open sky.
Women cooked in the garden, the shops were just open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, and therefore wood was exceptionally expensive.
The settlement of Greenland was sparse. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and called it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, tribes of Eskimos lived there at that time.
Although the countries are all Scandinavian, there are many differences between the nations, the kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
You might think a treasure map is drawn on the back of the United States Declaration of Independence if you watched the movie National Treasure.
However, this is not true. Something is written on the back of the declaration, but it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is clear that early in its life this large parchment document (75 x 62 cm) was rolled up for storage.
It is likely that the note has been added as a tag.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated Northern France, but Southern France was still not free.
It was controlled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invading armies instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies launched an invasion into Southern France; the operation was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the United States Army and Free French forces managed to liberate Southern France and then continued towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture that a very large group of people, who live and work together in a society, share with each other.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also somehow defines the scale of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilization involves knowledge that is transferred between generations, a long-term cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Smaller communities often disappear without leaving behind important historical evidence, and such cultures are not recognized as actual national cultures.
In the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak government – with the National Assembly as its only component – according to the first constitution.
The assembly did not have sufficient authority to impose taxes, and because there was no federal executive or judiciary present, it relied on the authorities in each state, which were often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
Nor did it have any authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the countries before they could be amended, and the countries showed such great disrespect to the state authority that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national team, has achieved the second-best results in the world among national teams, and Italy became the world champion in football in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to the archipelago, Japan is often referred to, geographically speaking, as an "island arc."
The beginning of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company set up camps in the southwestern part of Taiwan and changed the rice production traditions of the indigenous people, hiring workers from China to work on the company's rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the military of the Qing Empire (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of Western and Northern Taiwan and made Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the first war between China and Japan (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki and ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, specifically the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the area have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally were.
By the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed, and that reconstruction is still ongoing.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog movie era.
It is still being produced today, but what's more, the sensors of digital cameras are based on its aspect ratio.
The 35 mm format is actually rather confusing, it is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format collection) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-misused rule, often mocked as a third, is a simple guideline to create dynamics while maintaining order in a picture.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds horizontally and vertically intersect (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had amassed wealth and power, began to be seen with more critical eyes.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had bound European countries together despite different languages and customs.
Her authority influenced everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christians is that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist primarily for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in power in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether these doctrines were being fulfilled.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain blockaded Germany.
The strategy proved successful and halted essential military and civilian supplies, although this blockade was in violation of generally accepted international laws confirmed by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom deployed mines in international waters to prevent ship traffic into vast sea areas, which posed great danger even to neutral ships.
Germany expected similar reactions to the unrestricted submarine warfare because the reactions were limited to this tactic.
In the third decade, a policy of peace and isolationism was the prevailing attitude of most of the nation's people and countries.
After the horror and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to prevent such events from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient times, China used a unique method to denote different periods, each period in China's history or each ruling dynasty was distinguished as a separate empire.
The periods between the empires were unstable and characterized by disputes within the provinces. The most well-known period is the empire of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years, lying between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce warfare occurred between the various noblemen who fought for the crown.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died in battles to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi’an.
Many social and political influences are present, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from autocratic to democratic governance, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the nation and not to a single head of state.
After the revolution, jobs were available for male applicants and the most ambitious and powerful ones achieved the greatest success.
The same applies to the army because instead of the military classification being based on class, it was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave, later known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which withstood the test of time, provides a clear picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
The cave is on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is not easy at all to find it, even if one knows about it. Once inside the cave, complete isolation takes over.
There is nothing to see but a clear and beautiful sky, and many mountains surround the area. From inside the cave, there is little to see of that world or to hear.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands.
On the Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, one can find numerous pyramids (the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest of them), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest of them), some small tombs, a few temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for "upstroke" looks like a V, and the symbol for "downstroke" resembles a staple or a square missing the bottom.
Up means that you should start at the top and push the bow, while down means you should start at the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Generally, a softer sound is heard when the bow is stroked upwards and a stronger and clearer sound when the bow is stroked downwards.
Insert your own markings as desired, but keep in mind that the printed curve marks have musical significance, so they should generally be taken into account.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were on October 6, 1789, forced by a group of agitated market women to return to Paris.
They returned to Paris in a horse carriage and were surrounded by a mob that screamed and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the carriage windows completely open.
One from the mob swung the severed head of one of the king's bodyguards, who was killed in Versailles, in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipino nation itself had to bear the costs of the war caused by American imperialist policy due to conquests in their country.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government in the United States to meet a large portion of the expenditures and the interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine state was rolled through the investment banks on Wall Street.
The gains of American imperialism had their origins in the superprofits resulting from prolonged exploitation of the Filipino nation.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which the order was formed.
The time when the events took place is generally called the High Middle Ages, which is the period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended with a council around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses various kinds of ideas, ranging from technological push or technical imperatives to a strong sense that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path that is largely independent of cultural and political influences and that technology similarly has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile inevitably leads to road construction.
However, a nationwide road network is not financially viable for a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The large number of cars also leads to a higher frequency of road accidents, resulting in new methods in healthcare being invented to patch people up.
Romanticism played a major role in the cultural determinism derived from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to the romantic movement, the land shaped the individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged that were connected to the land and were in harmony with society, proving to be much better than laws enacted arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the contemporary era, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital during the feudal period in Europe.
The fame of this center of luxury began in 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had higher market value than what the markets in Byzantium could offer.
It was at this point in time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period from the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, style variations in the Western world may be about 25 to 30 years behind due to how slowly communication progresses.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest advancements that came about due to the Crusades was that people started fastening clothing with buttons.
Subsistence farming is agriculture aimed at producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming often revolves around a simple and organic system using seeds that originate from the ecosystem, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize the harvest.
Through the ages, most farmers have engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite as like-minded individuals who consider themselves neglected according to societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their affiliation through unique and symbolic style use, which includes fashion, demeanor, and slang.
One of the most traditional methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to rely on a few unfortunate cases of children who experience neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse. Children who do not receive socialization from adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "animalistic" or wild. Some animalistic children have been locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child's neglect was due to the parents' rejection of its severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is said that others were raised by animals. It is said that some have lived out in nature of their own accord.
When a child is raised entirely by animals other than humans, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost identical to the behavior of the animal that cares for it, such as fear of or lack of interest in humans.
Even though it may be easier and more interesting to learn in project-based education, learning aids take it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method. Rather, it should be seen as a tool that provides individuals with support to engage in innovative learning experiences, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both in virtual worlds and real worlds, i.e., a teacher is a kind of scaffold but the same applies to the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual learning supports are integrated into the software and are intended to critique, prompt, and explain methods that may have been too difficult for the student to solve alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for various reasons, which can range from neglect to abuse and even due to compulsory care.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and enriching, but they do.
We regard the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster system is intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
A foster home is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both media and personal communication.
The unique features of the Internet created an additional dimension in terms of efficiency and a satisfactory approach.
For example, "knowledge acquisition" and "social interaction" are highlighted as important incentives for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also defined as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
The theory has emerged that it is possible to determine if a person is lying by accurately interpreting the slightest expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in the paper The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nonetheless able to assess sincerity with precision.
He even suggests that such a skill in interpreting human behavior is something that animals like dogs also possess.
Research in the twentieth century has demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variability, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variability.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variability back and forth between two sets with each generation.
Out on the grassland, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to satisfy their amino acid needs with the available plants.
If, in addition, this has not been done, it can have serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources easiest to access were proteins from leaves and legumes. Primates like us, however, have difficulty digesting such things unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also contains high-quality proteins and essential amino acids.
When all is said and done, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a manner similar to how chimpanzees on the tropical savannahs do to this day.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep time and then falling back asleep shortly afterward (10–60 minutes).
It can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, place it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options related to circadian rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (particularly water or tea, known as diuretics) before sleep and forcing a person to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace one possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present. All individuals have the possibility to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has also been influenced by teachings on love from Mahayana as well as by various methods from Indian yoga.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of higher truth) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, and visualization.
The focal point of Tibetan meditation is yoga connected to deities. Cleansing of energy channels takes place by visualizing various gods, the energy centers are activated, and informational awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, disputes arose because their systems, methodologies, and cultures did not fit well together.
Less than two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
This was set to last for the next 40 years and would be seriously fought over by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive line had already been pushed back, and the only hope lay in retreating and reorganizing at the Romanian border.
However, these plans fell through when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army launched an attack and formed front lines in Belarus and Ukraine after the army invaded the eastern regions of Poland and violated the Riga peace agreement, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
It is most efficient to use ships to transport large numbers of people and substantial quantities of goods across the oceans.
The navy's role has always been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to transport your people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans attempted to transport manpower and materials across the Atlantic to assist the British.
Simultaneously, the German navy, which mostly employed submarines, was trying to stop these shipments.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans would probably have managed to conquer Britain as they did elsewhere in Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began storing such things to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often tended by goat herders, who were more often than not children or teenagers, similar to the better-known shepherds. These methods are still used today.
Roads for wagons were laid in England as early as the 16th century.
Roads for horse carts were only laid with adjoining planks of timber, but horses could nevertheless pull the carts at higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of that time.
Crossbeams began to be used rather early to keep the rails in place. But it gradually became apparent that the utilization of the rails would be better if they had iron on the top.
This was common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The first known forms of transportation went smoothly. Man began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk as upright.

It is possible to be kinder to the environment, become involved in the environmental movement, and even be an activist to reduce the misery of the future to some extent.
This is like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not want a temporary solution, then we should look for the root of the problem and disable it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the progress of humankind in science and technology, but growing problems are present due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyles of mankind.
On July 4, as soon as the congress had approved the constitution, John Hancock, the president of the congress, and Charles Thomson, the secretary of the congress, signed the handwritten drafts and sent them to the printing press of John Dunlap nearby.
That night, between 150 to 200 copies were made, which are called the "Dunlap broadsides".
John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6. He had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The oldest known copies of the document are the 25 Dunlap cannons. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group survived. That group of animals is called birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
Their feet have scales and claws, they lay eggs and use both hind legs to walk, just like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on processing information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and such digits are referred to as binary digits, or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning does not always become immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are very general, and therefore a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best signs of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container with medications or toxic household substances.
Check whether the labels contain instructions for first aid regarding this particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient knowledge about bedbugs. They are insects that have adapted to parasitize humans.
Both fleas and bedbugs are nest-loving, wanting to make themselves a nest in the host.
Within the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), and MS is the primary neurological disorder affecting younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in the best interest of either them or the child for them to raise the child.
These couples can choose to put together an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the child's parents relinquish their rights so that other parents can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through a scientific approach. This method actually guides most scientific research.
This is not the only objective because experiments, or tests to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations are also guiding themes of scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers emphasized classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science were generally accepted, including regarding psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the Western world lost contact with the philosophical and scientific roots of Greek culture.
Many rhythmic patterns in physiology and behavior often heavily rely on intrinsic cycles and their production by biological clocks.
A regular rhythm, which is not simply a response to external regular cues, has been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillations that maintain a regular rhythm even without external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading propositions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to splice their own DNA with a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA in the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Mutations in germline cells alone can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism captivates people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying nature, including wildlife and plant life.
Examples of recreational activities at the location include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, visits to botanical gardens, and learning something new about the ecosystem.
An example of such is traveling, taking photographs, and learning more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive to work from small suburban towns and meet others who were leaving the workplace.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has released the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In the developing countries, there are rarely as many complaints about water quality or bridges that are on the verge of collapse.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are the engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some fundamental issue to blame?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and the effects they have on each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is not possible to predict drivers' behavior with certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within normal limits. Consequently, there is a certain consistency in traffic flows that can be roughly represented by mathematical calculations.
To better describe the flow of traffic, relationships have been defined between the three main characteristics of traffic: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist with the planning, design, and operation of racetrack facilities.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. They used their ability to fly to easily escape enemies and to more efficiently seek food and mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more varied little places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings now are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right even though many believed the opposite, namely that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and even other planets).
There seems to be sense in this, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river in the world. At its widest, it is six miles.
A total of 20 percent of all the water that flows from the rivers of the Earth into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). Water is collected into it from thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom; however, pyramids as large and technically advanced as the pyramids at Giza were never built again.
The Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the smallest population.
In Vatican City, Italian is used for legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the state. Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Catholic.
Since ancient times, there has been knowledge of elements like gold, silver, and copper. All of these can be found in nature in their natural form. It is quite simple to work the materials with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle claimed that all matter was made of one or more elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also proposed a theory that they transform into new substances that make up what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that many elements can be found in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of elements that are not metals, such as carbon.
The universe is all made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend of many when it first appeared.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been downgraded in status and its use has decreased.
People now write messages on computer screens and never need to reach for a pencil sharpener.
One can only let one's mind wander about what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes on the market.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. If the core is split again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus and therefore tend to break apart with little or no friction.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner beneath the lunar mare and thicker beneath the highlands.
There can be more of Mary's near because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories aim to find out what motivates people or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt in adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Among the two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two kinds of behaviors can arise when agents start working for former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum, they try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
That kind of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, enforce sanctions, conduct performance reviews, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
The other end of the spectrum shows an unrecognizable person who feels that one must change everything the group has done so far and make the works their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's progress and mistakes.
This behavior often results in a rift forming between the leaders and the others in the team.
The same quality standards apply to virtual teams as to regular teams, although there is a slight difference.
Virtual teammates are often liaisons for the real group that is closest to them.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members as their teams may need to meet across different time zones that their managers at each location may not understand.
The existence of the true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element in virtual teams.
"The Invisible Team" is the management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One reason to implement ideas about a learning organization is innovation.
When all available resources have been used up by all departments of a company, creativity and genius may begin to emerge.
As a result, a company's collaboration in overcoming obstacles can lead to new ways of innovation to serve the interests of its customers.
For a company to become progressive, its management must create a culture of innovation in addition to information sharing and knowledge acquisition within the company.
Angel (2006) reports that companies can use the Continuum approach to significantly increase their capacity.
Neurological information provides substantial clues about the theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This, in turn, narrows the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior drives scientific research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, traumas, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functioning.
The rise of new technology enables us to see and study the composition of the brain and its functions like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Artificial intelligence has strong ties to science fiction, but in reality, artificial intelligence is a very important field within computer science and deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves building machines to perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior, automatically.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer analysis and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate fields where the emphasis is on creating solutions to real problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but it has been integrated into many programs in home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of all education. Often and frequently, the teacher is more than willing to take students to places that buses cannot reach.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can explore artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
A joint field trip is also a good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year that discusses their trip to the state capital. Every year, the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online for reference.
Blogs can also contribute to improved writing skills of students. In the beginning, students' blogs are often full of poor grammar and spelling, but the existence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the audience that criticizes the most, the blogger starts by trying to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
When students blog, "they have to become better acquainted with the world around them." The requirement to address the readers' interests encourages students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way to foster collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Responsible use of blogging "can encourage students to think critically; students can use online content to both take a stance on what others are writing and to present their own viewpoint on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting, bilingual capital of Canada. It hosts many art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north is the home of Muskoka's untouched natural beauty and beyond.
All these aspects and more show what out-of-towners consider to be particularly Canadian about Ontario.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of population that surprises many: There are more black people of African descent living in the United States than the total number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent on its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or connected to France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also came and brought Islam to the countries and it became very popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, European influence began to emerge, and colonialism started as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
To the north, the district's borders lie with the Sahel, and to the south and west, with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that women who travel claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that different cultures may manifest in what they consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be determined when you reject people and unafraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, this does not justify it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sailors in the 10th century BC. It was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a militarily important port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and jewelry, but all of this is made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Republic of Congo, located furthest to the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed in the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, which buried most of the town's streets in lava flow, especially the central part.
Although Goma is relatively safe, one should carefully consider all trips outside of Goma to understand the situation of the conflicts still raging in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, along with one of the cheapest treks to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel around Goma. The usual fare (within the area) is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Mixed with difficult accessibility, "Timbuktu" has started to be used as a metaphor for unusual, exotic places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation still attracts tourists and there is an airport in the area.
In 1990, the site was placed on the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat posed by the desert sand.
This was one of the main stops on the special "Wonders of Africa" with Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city is in perfect contrast to other cities within the country because it has more Arabic influence than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeastern part of South Africa and runs along the borders of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The public park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecosystems that support various wildlife.
The national park is among the top tourist destinations in South Africa and is an absolute gem among the national parks of South Africa (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, it is under constant protection and requires a fee to enter.
It can also be useful to buy the so-called "Wild Card" which provides access to a number of national parks in South Africa or all the national parks in South Africa.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, and most tourists visit there.
A sequence of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has sometimes been compared to a glittering bar chart. It appears by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best view of Hong Kong is from the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
A great majority of the urban planning of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British settlers claimed as their own, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coastline into the rural areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Sundarbans National Park is the forest area located within the territory of India.
The forests are not just marshy mire, though; they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one third is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses depart from the transport center (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Since the buses that run between regions are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets several days in advance.
Small Japanese buses run to most neighborhoods. They are comfortable and safe.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, the bridge is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open for traffic until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully operational by September 2017. At that time, it is anticipated that the Brazilian customs stations will have been completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group that lived in the area that is now Eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
In the Chaco region, there were homelands of other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who made their living from hunting and gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, or "the Great Indies Province," was established when Spanish settlers encountered groups of natives.
The Spaniards began the colonial period which lasted for three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous nature and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is well-known for its polo team and top-level polo players.
The biggest event of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo grounds.
One can also watch smaller tournaments and games here at other times of the year.
For match news and where to buy tickets for polo games, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), and its value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted in most places on the island, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outer islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, although British and American currency might be accepted. Check with the owners in advance about which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands, and therefore it is advisable to exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone. In the summer, it is common for the temperature to be over 30 °C.
The winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no particular "rainy" or "dry" season: the precipitation is similar throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild, and they must not be fed or disturbed.
According to the national park authorities, a distance of at least 100 meters must be maintained from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how peaceful they look, bison, moose, and bears, and almost all large animals, can attack people.
Annually, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and can prove dangerous, so they should be given plenty of space.
Additionally, you must keep in mind that scent attracts bears and other wildlife, so you should avoid bringing or cooking foods with strong odors and make sure to keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British battlecruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
In the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the high chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, being killed.
There are many beaches there because Auckland lies between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore coastline (in the North Harbor district) lies by the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and pohutukawa trees provide shade.
The shores of Tamaki Drive are along the Waitemata Harbour in the premium suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops by the shore. Swimming is safe.
The most popular beer at the place is "Number One", it is not a complex beer but good and refreshing. The other beer from the place is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be bought, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might withstand the journey better.
It is completely safe to drink the tap water in the area, but it is easy to obtain bottled water if you are concerned about the tap water.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is exotic. "Short black" is an espresso, cappuccino comes with a heap of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but very good.
Many trips are made to the reef all year round, and injuries due to any of this on the reef rarely occur.
Nevertheless, heed the advice in advance, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Velvet scoters are found near shores and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, they are found outside of this period.
Sharks exist. However, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, but their main habitat is at the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveler can relax knowing that they have secured a place to stay upon arrival.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package tours with breakfast, airport transfers, and sometimes flights and hotel in the same package.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or gather some documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
First contact the travel agency regarding changes and other requests before contacting the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of visitors attending music festivals choose to camp on site, and most of the guests consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages is finished, music may be played in the festival areas long into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Before taking the ferry across the Northern Baltic Sea during winter, it is best to check the location of the cabin, as the noise from sailing through ice can be overwhelming for sensitive people.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (please check the terms and conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to get visitors to spend as much time and money as possible. Most often, windows and clocks are nowhere to be found, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
There are usually special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. Intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
It is likely that anyone driving at high altitudes above sea level or over mountain passes will encounter heavy snow, slush, and cold on their journey.
On icy and snow-covered roads, traction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In a snowstorm, it can snow so much that one gets stuck in an instant.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or drifting snow or icing on car windows.
Icy and snow-covered conditions, on the other hand, are customary in many countries, and traffic proceeds mostly undisturbed throughout the year.
A safari is possibly the main attraction for tourists in Africa and the highlight of the trip for many visitors.
The term safari is generally used to refer to trips through the countryside to view stunning African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, for example elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment makes it easier to observe them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and can be seen better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "forest trek," "hiking safari," or going "on foot") involves a walk that lasts either several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Certain events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
As the Summer Olympics were held in Tokyo in 1964, it will be the only city in Asia that has hosted the games twice.
If you booked the flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might end up in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies will not extend into July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to begin.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, and regular tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
Wet clothes dry faster when they are ironed. At many hotels, it is possible to borrow an iron and ironing board, even when one is not in the room.
Try using a hairdryer if it's available, if you don't have an iron, or if you don't want to walk around in ironed socks.
Make sure the clothes do not get too hot (which can cause them to shrink or even singe).
Many methods are available to purify water. Some are more effective against certain threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil water for one minute, but in other places, the water has to be boiled longer.
Filters vary in quality, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may face animal diseases that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or infect.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm people or cause death, are generally not classified as plagues.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase products that are exempt from taxes and duties at certain locations.
Those who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerably, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The road section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the worst driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway and often runs through remote rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you should take care: Such roads are characterized by steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp bends.
Speed limits that are posted are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h - and strict compliance with them is even more important than otherwise.
However, it is interesting that mobile service is considerably stronger here than in other long stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.

In the interior regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry, whereas coconut milk is usually used in Southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
In Indonesia, there are 17,000 islands, and therefore the term Indonesian food covers a vast array of regional dishes throughout the entire country.
But if used without additional distinguishing features, the term refers to food that can be traced to the central and eastern parts of Java.
Javanese dishes are now being served widely across the archipelago. A diverse selection of simple and flavorful dishes is offered, where Javanese flavor predominates, including peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's legs, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can be a safety feature due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off but one of his feet is caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him along if it runs away. Several safety measures can be taken to reduce the risk of this happening.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, rather narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrup bars that cause the stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if pulled backward because the rider falls.

When conditions are good, you can travel quite a longer distance than if you were walking. However, you very rarely achieve the same speed as on cross-country skis without wearing a heavy backpack in ski tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small in size but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, one would have to go through multiple visas and passport checks when traveling between many countries.
The Schengen Area essentially functions as a single country in this regard.
If you stay in this area, it is generally possible to cross the border without going through passport control again.
In a similar way, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state separately, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiquities. Some tax offices define items over 100 years old as antiquities.

Due to the topography of the continental shelf, backflow accumulates in several deeper parts, and a swift current of deep-sea water can form there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, but it may not be possible.
As soon as one gets out of the current, it's no problem to swim back.
Try to take shelter or, depending on your skills and whether you have been seen, wait for rescue.

This is the same as in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Most popular cruises around the Baltic Sea feature a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city during the day and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you go ashore solely for shore excursions organized by the cruise line, you do not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin in Germany in their brochures. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not at all near the sea and therefore a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
People of all ages and different backgrounds can be afraid on a plane, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced trauma.
