Although an experimental vaccine seemingly reduces Ebola fatality, no medications have yet clearly proven to be suitable for treating an existing infection.
An experimental cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed a lot of promise in the field, but formal studies revealed that it had fewer benefits in preventing death than previously thought.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, which means that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs in their sport can be better served if we make meaningful changes within our organization, rather than causing decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely spread theory, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot deliver, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown above with a blotchy or carotenoid-colored underside.
The fund also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft (called a quill) but had other feather features — barbs and barbules — researchers concluded that the quill was probably a later evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers have proposed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen comes from mature feathers and not from the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen comes from adult feathers and not from the down of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep (Turkey). Two police officers were killed and more than twenty other people were injured.

Brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

This extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant "was very concerning and alarming due to its very high mortality rate."
A few patients might have been infected in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were from the hospital staff.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

All the cave entrances, which were called "The Seven Sisters," have a diameter of at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet).
Infrared images show that the temperature fluctuations from day and night prove that it is probably a case of caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but they are consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff (Arizona).
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their candidate of choice into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that at the beginning of the voting no envelopes are inside and that no envelopes are added except those from duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to special procedures.

Her other event, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's seated Giant Slalom with a combined running time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the women's single-seater group could not complete their run, and 45 out of the total 117 female skiers in the giant slalom could not qualify.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and the mobile phone.
The deputy of the general inspector D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile phone and her laptop."
Accused were Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police President Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the emergency services rescued the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Meanwhile, Adekoya was charged at the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh with the murder of her son.
She is in pretrial detention until she is charged and brought to court, but all witness testimonies could be prejudiced because her photo was widely published.
That is common in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes, "that journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecution, informed journalists that no further comments would be made until the indictment.
According to the data leak, the document refers to the disputed border area that Palestine claims based on the pre-Six-Day War 1967 borders.
Further alleged topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years as soon as an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority wants to allow this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control study should be closely monitored by rangers, as the study was supervised and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Deputy Director for Park Protection and Heritage of the NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service), the four selected shooters received comprehensive instructions on the topics of safety and training for the first shooting event.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presiding commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failed elections, which have been due in part since 2011.
There were approximately 60 reported cases of iPods overheating, which resulted in a total of six fires and four people sustaining minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 more overheating incidents to them, which the company described as "not concerning."
The ministry reacted to the postponement of the report by Apple, calling it "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday 9:19 a.m. GMT).
The Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage was reported throughout the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A few hostages have been rescued, and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an older lady who had to go to the toilet. De Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his free time.
His research showed that when a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid their last respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna left us on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even a little more... I loved her and miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, those who are against Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Among the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He was unable to take medication to overcome his pain because they are prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
A few people verified the discovery using different hardware until the beginning of February, and that was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been, along with organic substances that can form proteins and support life, a source for water supplies to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, above all, how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
At the beginning of this year, Cuomo took office as governor at the age of 53, and last month, he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriages.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential elections.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will enable airplanes to fly shorter distances, save millions of tons of fuel, and reduce CO₂ emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground radar-based technology, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional means of transport in operation and overcrowded trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking spaces and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear of lacking means of transport increased the possibility that the game would have to be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on a Thursday in Science reported on the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although the process likely took much longer due to the breeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all possible forms. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be worked with a hammer and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stuck onto other metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books, called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is referred to as the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using juice from red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (the H in the pH value) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feel bumpy and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remnants of sewage systems were found.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women gathered in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost instantly back down.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light in sight.
A huge rocket more than 30 meters high is needed to bring a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in indescribable ways. The greatest advantage we owe to the wheel is much faster and easier transportation options.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Among them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and red deer.
After all, there are many small cats (including free-ranging house cats) that eat the much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task that each cat has which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups also called prides.
A pack consists of one to four adult males, together with up to thirty females and young ones.
The women are usually close family with each other because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to those of wolves or dogs – animals that are surprisingly similar to the lion (but not other big cats) in behavior – and they are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-conditioned athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the complete roar of a lion, but rather like a tangled sentence, yelled words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey animals to eat by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move well. Ocelots hunt their prey by adapting to their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (such as by moving over a mountain or a river, or by relocating to a new island and thus cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were previously in.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to their new surroundings, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can never be called the same species again.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an unavoidable form and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses and produce our clothing from plants. The majority of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the palate, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't take him on.
Although the majority of their food seemed familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women sat on chairs and ate, the rich men liked to hold banquets together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Meals in ancient Rome could not contain any foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no old people ever ate guinea fowl.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Occasionally, special pyramid-shaped towers – called ziggurats – were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Near East, houses were not so important.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the garden, the shops had only open counters to the street. Stone was used for the construction of houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to the Northern legends, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But independent of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences regarding people, kings, customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie 'National Treasure', you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is, however, not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text is located at the bottom of the reversed document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
It is therefore likely that the remark was simply added as a description.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated Northern France, but the South was still occupied.
He was governed by the "Vichy"-French. Those were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In not even two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civic, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and an orderly dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation – with the Congress being its only component.
The Congress had no power to raise taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state agencies, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
He also had no authority to abolish tax laws and duties between the states.
The clauses required unanimous approval from all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government lightly, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the world champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan has its origins as far back as the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiated a transformation of the core production of the indigenous people, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644 – 1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the past.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
The most commonly used photo format worldwide for still images is, for example, 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced nowadays, but especially its aspect ratios have been taken over by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35-mm format is actually, what one might slightly simplify, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format family) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The often misused and frequently mocked Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
She claims that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Their all-pervasive power affected everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's funds exist specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from navigating entire sections of the ocean, which has even endangered neutral ships.
Because there was only a limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to prevent a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA to see Thomas Edison with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job).
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different eras: Each phase of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an uncertain time with divided provinces. The most famous of these eras was the Epoch of the 'Three Kingdoms,' which lasted 60 years and occurred between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a severe war took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, which enabled the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of army ranks based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also encouraged many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was strongly interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He repeatedly visited a cave known as 'Hira' on the mountain 'Noor' (Light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has endured through the centuries, provides a very vivid image of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if one knew that it existed. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains to be seen. When one is in the cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), a few small tombs, a few temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and several of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The "uptrend candlestick" looks like a V, and the "downtrend candlestick" resembles a bracket or a square missing the bottom side.
Above means that you should start at the tip and press the bow, and below means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
A downstroke generally produces a softer tone, while an upstroke is stronger and more decisive.
Feel free to make your own markings with a pencil, but don't forget that the printed bowings are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be adhered to.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris by a mob of market women from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and yelled threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a participant of the mob held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was terrified to death.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, as a large portion of the expenses and the interest on the bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the fundamental achievements of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 – 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice; from technology-push or technological imperative to a strong sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
One could, for example, say that the car necessarily led to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network is not economically profitable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs for the vehicle owner.
Mass motorization also leads to a higher frequency of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In connection with Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures emerged that are related to this geography and were better than arbitrary imposed laws because they were in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renown as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th to 11th and the 14th century.
In the beginning, Byzantine culture had a very strong influence on garments in the East.
The styles in the West might, however, lag 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication channels.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments from that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that combines seeds originating from the ecoregion with crop rotation or uses other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, behavior, and argot.
One of the most frequently used methods to clarify the meaning of socialization is to refer to a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse by adults while they were growing up.
Such children are called "feral." Some feral children were confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this confinement of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical impairment.
Young runaways may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If that wild child is raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost entirely similar to those of the respective foster animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support that assists individuals who are having a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual as well as real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but this also applies to the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and should query, prompt, and explain processes that might have been too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in care facilities for numerous reasons, ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to exploitation.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, social, and educational, but it is just the way it is.
We see the care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our care system should provide a safe home, caregivers who have a very warm manner, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Care provision should provide all the necessities that were missing in the house from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent properties of the internet lead to additional dimensions with regard to the usage and gratification approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are regarded as important motivations for internet usage (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they examined audience reactions to internet sites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions – facial movements of a few milliseconds.
Above all, it is claimed that one can recognize whether a person is suffering by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper The President's Speech how people who cannot understand language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills are shared in the interpretation of human behavior by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two poles of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination shift the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Furthermore, there are serious consequences if you don't do this: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (seafood, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide a wealth of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in almost the same way that the chimpanzees do nowadays in the savanna.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes later).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively slow alarm clock to bring you to consciousness but not fully awaken you.
If you set the clock back in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The measure of inner peace that a person possesses correlates inversely with the measure of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is the Guru Yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clashes of system, process, and culture led to the collapse of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies developed into enemies, which ushered in the Cold War.
It was supposed to last the next 40 years and be fought by proxies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in numerous other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
These plans were almost overnight outdated, when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union marched in and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient way to transport many people and goods across oceans.
The task of the navy traditionally consists of ensuring that their country retains the ability to move their people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the ability of their enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to get men and material across the Atlantic to assist Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried, primarily with submarines, to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain and the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
All cultures and peoples have kept them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
House goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders, who were often children and adolescents, similar to the widely known shepherds. This method of herding is still used today.
Roller coasters were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although railways mainly consisted of parallel wooden beams, they allowed horses to pull wagons more quickly and transport larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of those days.
Railroad ties were introduced fairly early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it turned out that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
That became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first cast iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking; humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 – 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join an environmental movement, and we can even be activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
That is like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and we should eliminate them.
It is obvious enough that the scientific and technological advancements of humanity have greatly changed the world, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of humanity.
After being adopted by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a little further to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 to 200 copies were made, which are known today as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap flying leaves, of which we know still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The handwritten original copy has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists are convinced that a group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are considered binary digits – or bits (to use computer language).
An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
On the label, you will find specific first aid instructions for the respective poison.
The term "Kiewerlek" is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the predatory bugs and the bedbug are nest-dwellers, which have adapted to life in the nest or the dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest – or that of their child – to raise a baby.
These couples can decide to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to clarify how the world works through the scientific method. This method definitely guides the majority of scientific research.
She does not do it alone, Experimenting – and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses – asking questions and making observations are also part of conducting scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not merely reactions to external periodic cues have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that continue to run for a while even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, which either marked the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit nature areas to enjoy the landscape, including the plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in cars to drive to their workplaces and pass by those whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system that is based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has disrupted one of the stable conditions of the biosphere that has supported the evolution of humanity over the last 2 million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In industrial countries, one rarely hears complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation planners simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships between the three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
That offers them a wider range of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, mayflies and burrowing mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold back their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people assumed the opposite; that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), would move around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, in some places nearly 9.7 kilometers wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers worldwide into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical achievement of the construction of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Already in antiquity, humans knew basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be found in nature in their natural form and can be extracted relatively easily with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more than the 4 states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma; although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys with small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so surrealistically small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was, therefore, a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil has become less important and less used with the development of new writing methods.
People now write messages on computer screens and no longer need sharpeners.
One can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The renewed division of the cell nucleus then releases a part of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they break apart with little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker over the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what people tick or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reached adulthood.
This theory considers what is going on with certain people who want the things they want, and which things in their surroundings lead to them wanting certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can arise when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain 'one of the colleagues'.
This type of leadership struggles to make unpopular decisions, enforce disciplinary actions, conduct performance evaluations, delegate responsibility, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable person who feels the need to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as liaisons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can meet according to the respective time zones, which is not necessarily understood by the local management.
The characteristic of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each individual member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized in the functional areas of a company, creativity and resourcefulness can be expressed.
Here, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the customers.
For an organization to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous use as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus, they narrow the research field and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
That provides us with a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us to understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI forms a very important field of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research includes the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such matters have become separate disciplines that focus on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, technology, and military, but is also integrated into many home computer and video game software applications.
Excursions make up a large part of every class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is a good opportunity to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
Every year, the students of Bennet School in North Carolina, for example, design a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is rebuilt every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help to improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the awareness of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author starts striving to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become better acquainted with the world around them." The necessity to capture the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
An appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of comments from others and also emphasize their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital city of Canada and has a range of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls and to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered typically Canadian by foreigners.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of the population, which is very surprising: There are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself when it comes to flora and fauna.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or are linked with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it was a long way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel zone, in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that traveling women say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they might perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, and so on.
Don't be timid when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to assert yourself (cultural differences aside, that doesn't make it right!).
The present-day city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in the year 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish traders, who established trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old town of Medina, you will easily find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a plethora of gadgets are sold, but that is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's roads, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all trips outside Goma should be examined to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla excursions in Africa.
You can take a Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
A combination with its relative inaccessibility made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations during the PBS Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities of the country, as it has more of an Arabic than African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are also daily conservation and entrance fees for the park here.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the region of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider as the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront promenade opposite.
A large portion of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonists claimed for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove area in the world and extend from the coast over 80 km (50 miles) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamp, however – they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles that once spread over the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and over 30,000 axis deer in the area.
The buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (across the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Because the cross-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical distance beneath the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group that lived in what is now Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunters, who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the home of other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of India," was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous groups.
For the Spaniards, the Age of Colonization began, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in the year 1537, Paraguay has preserved a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be watched here at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo players, check with the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to a British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the 'FIC West' shop.
The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the remote islands, although British and US currency is accepted; check with the owners in advance for an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures typically exceed +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: The temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There is no particular "rainy" or "dry" season: The amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild, and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, one should keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how tame they look, bison, moose, elk, bears, and just about all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous; so give them their space.
Furthermore, you should be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia, with just under 40,000 inhabitants, is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the high-ranking chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to the two harbors of Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The 'North Shore' beaches (in the 'North Harbour' district) lie on the Pacific and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most provide shade through pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
There are two local beers, the most important is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing; the other is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that one must have tried, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might get there more easily.
The local tap water can be safely drunk, but mineral water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'Flat White' coffee is exotic. A short black is called 'Espresso', Cappuccino has whipped cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many excursions to the reef are made throughout the year and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, consult the authorities for advice, follow all the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been coming to the beaches and river mouths from October to April since 1770. Sometimes they can also be found outside of that period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If booked in advance, the traveler can be quite reassured that he will have somewhere to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, although you might also be able to book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain other documents for your travel destination (e.g., visa).
Changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of participants at music festivals decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be right where the action is, you need to get up early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember, even when the music on the main stage comes to an end, there might still be areas of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, then check the state of the cabin, as passing through ice can cause quite eerie noises for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually adhere strictly to maximizing the time spent and money spent by clients. Windows and clocks are usually missing, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and on the premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic drinks on the house. But alcohol impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who travels in high latitudes or over a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is low and one cannot drive as if on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for one to get stuck.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or blowing snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries and traffic usually continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attractions in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland journeys to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars closely, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with a spotting scope.
A walking safari (other terms include "bush walk", "walking safari", or "on foot") consists of hikes, either lasting several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games are held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events are held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city that has hosted the Olympic Summer Games twice, having already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing about ¥7,000.
Hanging out damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if you are not in the room.
If no stretch spray is available, or you don't feel like wearing stretched socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful that the fabric does not get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various possibilities for the purification of water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In a few areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, a few minutes are necessary.
Filters have different effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a known company.
Travelers may encounter pests in their home regions that they are not familiar with.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or in the worst case trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers who enter countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently leads through remote woods.
If you are used to driving on country roads, then stay alert: steep inclines, narrow alleys, and sharp bends prevail.
The stated speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections – usually 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph) – and adhering strictly to them is even more important than usual.
Strangely, the cell service here is much stronger than along other parts of the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor Austria.
Pastries with fruit are everyday; apples are baked into pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums are added in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you're looking for small but rich pastries, try what is offered depending on the region as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, cooked together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can vary from "dry" to "a sauce" depending on the liquid content.
In the hilly regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the nation.
When, however, it is used without further specification, the term usually means food from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine has meanwhile spread widely throughout the archipelago and offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors of Javanese cuisine being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer more stability for the rider, but they can raise safety concerns because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but a foot remains caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, various safety precautions can be taken.
First, all riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to come off the saddle if pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and rocks.
Summits offer breathtaking views from the peaks. Mountaineers from all parts of the world always find new routes among the endless potential of walls.
Descending snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrains with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are occasionally also called "ski fanatics" and plan their entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to around 5000 BC!
The sport of skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational skiing club of Norwegians in Australia was founded.
Backpacking tours on skis: This activity is also called ski-mountaineering, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related, but usually not associated with alpine skiing-like tours or mountaineering, whereby the latter takes place on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine the ski slope as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly larger distances than on foot – but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for a few visas and go through passport controls.
The Schengen Area functions in this regard similarly to a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Exactly like this, with a Schengen visa you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member state, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which handmade items are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, with the age limit in countries like North America possibly being lower than in Europe.
Hand-crafted products could be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many alongside other professions.
Also traditionally, not all Sami were extensively involved in reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities and kept reindeer largely as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work as modern craftsmen. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the area of the Sámi.
Although it is widespread, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and the inaccurate perception of the Roma.
If the country you want to visit is affected by a travel warning, it may impact your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
Maybe you also want to take advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens could be confronted with different situations in the Near East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are no more than a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The provided views are often superficial, general, and in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere, oversimplified.
Severe weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or the loss of human life.
Thunderstorms can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hailstones, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are often advised to be aware of the danger of storms that can occur in their area, as they can affect travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
When searching the internet for 'hostile environmental course', the address of a local company is likely to appear.
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, typically combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing and a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the wild are commonly found, but there are only a few publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers planning a gender transition abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports where the gender is not specified (X) or to update documents to reflect a change of name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents varies widely.
Screenings at security checkpoints became much more intrusive in the time after September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through the scanner with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning currents of waves that break on the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow concentrates on a few deeper sections, and a fast current can form there in the deep water.
Most fatalities are the result of fatigue when trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you emerge from the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be pulled back in, or depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, it might be advisable to wait for rescue.
The re-entry shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (has less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be difficult.
Travelers who were able to easily adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, the people were probably patient and full of understanding because they knew that travelers have to adapt in a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers who return home.
The Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in peace before the show begins.
Normally, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx is regarded as the background and narrator of a long narrative.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in the year 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in the year 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The ridges of the peninsula merge here with the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, also called Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson as the highest point at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make calls.
The service is often used by shipping, including sport boats, as well as expeditions that require external data and language recognition.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how you can connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, applying for a year abroad can actually enhance your chances of higher education when you return home.
Normally, tuition fees are due to enroll in these study programs.
Finland is a wonderful travel destination for boating trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has a few thousand islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, one does not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, smaller boats or simply a kayak offer a different experience.
In Finland, boating is a national hobby with a boat for seven to eight people.
That can be found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, the number in the Netherlands is about one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises offer a longer stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
This means that you can visit the historic town for a few days while you sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go onshore with cruise excursions, then you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises attract with Berlin (Germany) in the brochures. However, as you can see on the map above, Berlin is not on the sea, and the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a distressing experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: It is no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that many other people have.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear of the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often critical for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the largest companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they had sent items by air freight, it could have taken days on some routes before everything was unloaded and cleared customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline regulations do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The obvious thing about the opportunity to fly first or business class is that it involves paying a lot of money for the privilege (or even better, having your company pay for it).
That is not cheap, though: As a rough rule of thumb, one can expect to pay up to four times as much as for Business Class and eleven times as much as for First Class!
Generally, it makes no sense whatsoever to search for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know very well that there is a certain core of air travelers – those who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably – and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-declared Transnistria Republic in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any of the UN member countries.
Economic relations were re-established between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
İzmir, with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
While it was once the ancient city of Smyrna, today it is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades, and the modern shopping centers overlook traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of an atmosphere of the European Mediterranean than of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík, with a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, has an extraordinary octagonal church.
At the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on some graves.
It is worth it to amble for half an hour through the fascinating village.
In the north and easy to reach, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners following a fervent depiction of its splendor recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you must also visit the significant Shrine of Fatima, a globally known place for Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that holds an almost incalculable significance for another part of the world's population.
There still live many men and women who survived their time here, and many more who were killed or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching the structures with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the people speak Catalan, a very large part understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs, however, are only in Catalan because it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have the reputation of being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to present oneself in the best light and behave like a "bien élevée" (well-mannered) person. It simplifies everything significantly.
The abrupt behavior of the Parisians quickly fades if you are a bit polite.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests - mainly beech, spruce, and pine - and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably large variety of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie can be found there, along with many other species.
During the visit to the monasteries, women must wear skirts that go beyond the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most cloisters provide a wrap for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a colorful one, you will be greeted with a smile by the monk or the nun at the entrance.
That's exactly how men have to wear shorts that go over the knees.
You can also borrow that from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after every use, so you might feel uncomfortable when putting on the skirts. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple, popular evening meal, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and all available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All main words next to the word 'Sie' for 'Dir' always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
That is a very important opportunity to distinguish between a few verbs and objects.
It presumably also simplifies reading, although writing is a bit complicated due to the necessity of figuring out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Make sure you pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: 'caro' means 'dear', but 'carro' means 'car'.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Reading this grammar textbook would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it becomes easier to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak little Spanish might then erroneously conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain preserved as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution at its peak was not as much of a problem as it is nowadays, they were usually located in cities or on campuses and were easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, called Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the Emperor held the first cherry blossom festivals exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally designed garden, you will also be immediately thrown out without discussion if you "collect specimens."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to live, very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost everything upon arrival.
But because it is located in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Verify that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Bathing water routes can be a good theme to plan a vacation around.
You can, for example, visit the castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat tour on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday were also adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at an exposed point to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could certainly be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday during the Easter weekend, with communities frequently celebrating the resurrection of Christ precisely at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the island either swam, flew, or drifted on the water.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to make the journey, resulting in the giant tortoise being the first mammal on the Galapagos.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or the Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
That offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, because the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you are also able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and more formal than what people from the West are used to.
Suits are standard business attire and employees address each other by their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial and emphasizes the efforts of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain approval for all decisions they make from their supervisor, and they are expected to follow their supervisor's instructions without asking questions.
