This does not merely confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has already spread, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut on top with a pale underside or of a carotenoid color.
Discoveries also provide a vision about the evolution of penalties in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a very developed central shaft, called a rachis, but they do have other characteristics of feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers deduce that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather in thermoregulation or display. Researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not that of a hatchling.
Researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not of a chick.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, early yesterday, killing two officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
That phenomenon that the team was investigating seemed to be caused by tidal forces between dark matter of the galaxy and matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is situated around a type of halo, and it is made of many tiny particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, they put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their election candidate in an envelope.

Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. At night, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In another race, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian finalist Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the first finalist Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers from the women's ski group could not finish their race, and 45 out of a total of 117 Giant Slalom skiers did not qualify in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh recover stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya says: "We have already arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with a covered face.
Despite three people being inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been on trial since then in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court accused of killing her son.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness can be influenced because his image has been widely published.
That is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently and the court has regarded the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, observes "it seems that journalists are treading a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for judicial processes, told journalists that no further comments would be made, at least until an accusation is made.
The document, according to the information leak, refers to border disputes, which Palestine claims based on pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other topics allegedly addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan River Bank.
Israel will maintain a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, as part of an agreement, while AP agrees to allow this presence only for five years.
Shooters in additional pest control trials should be closely supervised by forest rangers, just as the trials are monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of Conservation and Heritage of the Park with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation are receiving detailed instructions and safety training.
Martelly yesterday installed a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members.
He/She left Martelly's party four years ago.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Electoral Commission as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
That commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
Those protests, sometimes violent, were triggered due to the non-realization of elections, some unforeseen since 2011.
About 60 cases of defective iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it had knowledge of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported over 34 overheating incidents, which the company called "non-severe."
The Ministry responds calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center says there is no indication of a Tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fires his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have already been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Several hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly lady, since she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shaken.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She qualified as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland Maternity in 1959.
While he/she was working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature birth during his/her free time.
If research shows that if given a hormone, it accelerates the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reports that government investigators recovered the two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Comrades of the free struggle also pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said to me: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night of two moons. Very unique like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as exquisite as me... maybe even more... I loved her and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of those 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, those who are against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants share their opinion that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the results of the latest survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games centers, but because of his complaints, his aptitude is in doubt.
He cannot manage to get the medicine he needs for his pain because it is banned in those Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number so far on January 25th.
Many people verified that discovery with the use of different hardware and software at the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets could possibly have been a source of water supply to Earth along with organic material that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists have hope of understanding how planets form, especially how Earth formed, considering how comets have collided with Earth many times.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his administration at the beginning of this year, and he signed a law last month legalizing marriage between people of the same sex.
He referred to those rumors as "chatter and political foolishness".
It is speculated that he might run for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to travel on shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology based on terrestrial radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no other means of transportation as underground trains do not go to Wembley and car parking and stations are not available on the ground.
The risk of lack of transportation raises the possibility of the game being forced to play behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process had taken much longer, due to reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in all kinds of ways. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched to make a thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled to make sheets.
It can be made very finely, and attached to another metal. It can be made so finely that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted photos in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is called the pH of a chemical product. It's possible to make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on whether the solution is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electron (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Take those two and mash them together, then, with clean and wet hands, squeeze them inside the bowl.
That moisture in your hand reacts with the outside cold, which seems a bit strange and forms a kind of shell.
Cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There was also sanitation in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, sanitation sometimes was part of public bathhouses where men and women would be together in the same place.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
That satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
A satellite is sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use a telescope in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has already changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
Bring it with a train, car, and many other transport devices.
Their diet consists mainly of medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small predators (including stray pets like cats) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has to prevent it from competing with others.
The lion is the most social feline that lives in large groups called a pride.
The pack has one to three adult males, along with about thirty females and young ones.
Usually women are closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions act a lot like packs of wolves or dogs, they are surprisingly similar to lions (but not like other large felines) in behavior, and also quite deadly to their prey.
Like a well-prepared athlete, a tiger can climb (but not directly), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not a roar full of voice like a lion’s, it is more like a phrase of words growled and shouted.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost every animal that the ocelot hunts is much smaller than it.
Scientists find that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) through smell, by sniffing where they were on the ground.
They manage to see very well in the dark with night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from where they came (like if they go to the top of a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island making it difficult for them to return easily), many times they find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore this new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, and they do not need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to resemble less and less the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations have such a different appearance that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food in the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses with plants and we make our clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
If a purchased jaw was packed with more than 70 sharp teeth, together with a set displayed in the sky of the mouth, it meant that everything that happened on this path would not escape.
We do not know for sure, but it might have had a serrated tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could have been a cannibal.
Also, it attacks anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could deal with it.
Although most of their food seemed familiar to us, the Romans had their share of unusual or rare festive items, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while those poor people and that woman eat food sitting on a chair, the rich men liked to have a banquet together where they sat aside while having their meals.
Ancient Roman feasts could not have included foods that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple that is considered the home of the god.
People used to make sacrifices to gods and priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through those ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an outer temple courtyard and then a sanctuary inside that only priests could enter.
Special towers in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, are constructed to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for that god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, that house was not very important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family happens around books.
Women used to cook in the backyard; stores were just facades facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
Large forests did not exist in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was colonized very little. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red, exiled from Iceland for murder, traveled westward, found Greenland, and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, nomadic tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite being something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." This text appears on the lower part of the document, from top to bottom.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that, at the beginning of its life, that large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was simply raised as a label.
Landings of D-Day and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy." These were the French who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of waging war against them.
August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded the south of France, that invasion was called “Operation Dragoon”.
In just two weeks, American and French Free Forces liberated the south of France and they were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civilis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also defines, in some way, the dimension of society.
City-States are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge through various generations, a well-kept cultural trace, and fair dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear many times without leaving significant historical evidence and they cannot be recognized as an adequate civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed their first central government known as the Continental Congress as its only component according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its measures.
He also did not have the authority to annul laws and fiscal tariffs within the state.
These Articles require the unanimous consent of all States before they are altered and the States are not linked to the central government in such a way that their representatives were almost always absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in geographical terms, as an "archipelago."
The origin of Taiwan begins from the 15th century, where European sailors who used to pass by the island recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southeast of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production practices of indigenous cereals and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of coastal areas in the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three large structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Still today it is produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited for the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
That 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusing, 36mm in width by 24mm in height.
Aspect ratio (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is, therefore, referred to as 3:2.
A formatted mount (like the APS format family, for example) is equal to or approximates many aspect ratios.
That rule of thirds, often abused and many times ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and, at the same time, maintains a sense of order in an image.
He states that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had already become rich and powerful, came under control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion unified European states despite differences in language and customs.
If omnipresence can affect everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s monetary funds are there specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money leads many people to question whether these principles were being followed.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proves to be effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, despite the blockade violating generally accepted international rights, codified by many international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain mines international waters to prevent the entry of any ships in all those sections of the ocean, and even captures neutral ships.
As expected, with a limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid a situation of that kind again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in America with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Also, within each dynasty, there was one that was unstable due to divided provinces. The most well-known from this period was the era of the Three Kingdoms which occurred over 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During this period, there were violent wars between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
Those Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest place of the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, occupations were available for all male candidates in a way that allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to troops because instead of troop ranks based on class, now it is based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was profoundly interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He would frequently go to a cave known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The very cave, which has survived for a long time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Situated on one of those northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it is not easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you are inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky from the top of the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built for the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed to honor deceased Pharaohs.
Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead has many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
That large pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of those smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "arc upwards" sign looks like a V and the "arc downwards" sign looks like a hook or a square without its lower side.
Upwards means you should start at the tip and pull the bow, and downwards means you should start at the middle (where your hand is holding the bow) and push the bow.
An upward bow generally produces a softer sound, while a downward bow is stronger and more assertive.
It is up to you to mark your score with a pencil, but remember that the printed marks on the sheet music are there for a musical reason, so in general they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, all in fear, were forced by a mob of market rioters around Versailles to go to Paris on October 6, 1789.
On the carriage, this journey back to Paris was surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening against the King and Queen.
A crowd of people urged the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
At a certain moment, a member of the crowd heals the head of a dead royal guard in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The devastation of the war of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of America to cover most of the expenses and interests on obligations floating in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
It is clear that the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
That era in which those events generally happened is called the High Middle Ages, that period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 A.D.).
High Middle Ages was preceded by Early Middle Ages and followed by Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impulse or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and the manifestations of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, on its own, has "effects" on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that automobiles necessarily drive the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable just for the few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The high speed of cars on the roads also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time customs and culture related to this geography emerge, and they, being in harmony with the society's place, were better than laws imposed in an arbitrary manner.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople is regarded as the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly because the Crusades had resulted in the return with goods like silks and spices that were more valued than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own styles. One of the major developments of the era, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native seeds of the region stored along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same mentality who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be different due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often signal themselves through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and color.
One of the most common methods used to describe the importance of socialization is to take advantage of those few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
This type of children is called "feral" or "wild". Some feral children have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children happens due to parental rejection of the severity of a child's intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are allegedly raised for livestock; some say they live in the wild on their own.
An environment that is completely created for non-human animals, wild upbringing exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of a particular pet, such as its fear or indifference towards living beings.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the assistance is moving a step forward.
Assistance is not a learning method, but rather a help that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as the use of computer programs or the start of a new project.
Assistance can be both virtual and real, that is, a teacher is a form of assistance, but that paperclip man in Microsoft Office is too.
Virtual Assistants are embedded in software and they serve to ask, suggest, and explain procedures that might have been a challenge for a student to tackle on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, to family disruption.
Children should never be raised in an environment that is not welcoming, caring, and educational, but they still grow up.
We understand that Family Placement Systems are a safety zone for these children.
Our family care systems must provide a safe home, loving care, stable education, and reliable health care.
Family foster care should meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they have been removed.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to more dimensions in terms of uses and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuity of relationship" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reasons with websites.
The use of video recording leads to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to know if someone is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are incapable of understanding speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity and deception.
He even suggests that these capacities for interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Studies of the 20th century have already shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations increase new genetic variation, and selection acts from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination hinder variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Translate that, if they don't manage it, there will be serious consequences: lack of growth, malnutrition, and even death.
Accessible plant resources are more easily served proteins accessible in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide a high quantity of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
When we all wake up, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors were solving their “protein problems” in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of waking up intentionally during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep a short time afterward (10-60 minutes).
That can be done easily using a relatively silent alarm to make you aware without fully waking you up.
If you realize that your head resets the alarm during sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which forces you to get up and turn it off.
Other suggested habits based on the biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which forces someone to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force presents itself. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that blocks the path to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded to the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of total love.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is the Yoga of Divinity. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of light is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, system confrontations, processes, and culture led to the fall of countries.
With the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was for over 40 years and served as a serious fighter, for their representational success, on the battlefield from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Around September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, this plan became almost obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga Peace, the Soviet-Polish Non-aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is without a doubt the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The work of the Navy has always been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, it interferes with the ability of your enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of that was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly U-shaped submarines, was attempting to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to conquer Great Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to create paths to facilitate access to milk, cheese, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were typically kept in pens that were moved to the mountains and other grazing areas, often herded by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known cattle herders. These livestock rearing methods are still used today.
Caravels built in England came at the beginning of the 16th century.
Although those wagons were made only from wooden planks side-by-side, the horses managed to pull them to reach greater speed and carry much more loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Crossings were introduced quite early to maintain a path in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks serve more efficiently if they had an iron stipulation on top.
That has become common practice, but iron causes more wear on the train wheel rims.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron carts were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking, humans began walking about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is customary.
Specialization of bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmentalist movement, and we can even be activists to be able to reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
That is exactly like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we must look for the root of the problem, and we must address it.
It is quite obvious that the world has already changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and problems have become more numerous because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After his address to the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten proposal signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the print shop of John Dunlap, a short distance away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Borda largu".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8th.
An order to George Washington on July 6, which he sent to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
Those 25 copies of Dunlap broadsides that are still known are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original manuscript copy does not survive.
Today, some paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs escaped and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk with their two back legs like a T-Rex.
Practically every computer in use today is based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, that is, 1 or 1, and this number is referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, like vomiting, are sufficiently general so that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of something like an open medicine bottle or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
That term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both of them, they observe Asasinu like they observe the Bed as if it were a nest, adapted to live in the river or in the busy house that gives marriage.
In America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Investigations have already discovered that women are twice as likely to have MS compared to men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or their child's, to raise a baby.
The couple can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of raising the child.
The main objective of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method of fact is the guiding principle for most scientific investigations.
But it is not only experimentation, and experience is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that also guide scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's opinions on all matters of science, including psychology, have been accepted.
As Greek knowledge waned, the West became isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Observed rhythmic patterns in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic suggestions, have been documented in the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues a period of free-running cycle, even in the presence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
These two experiments mark the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material segments, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be transmitted to children, whereas mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of appreciating landscapes, including fauna and flora.
Examples of activities in the area include hiking, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about the orangutans in Borno.
Every morning, people leave from the peripheral neighborhoods by car to go to their workplaces and they pass by other people whose work destination is where they just left.
In this go and come of dynamic transportation, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which they rely on.
Science indicates now that this massive carbon economy has already displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In a developed country, you almost never hear a similar level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate these types of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of vehicle drivers between two points and the interactions they have among them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Ultimately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be more or less mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, granting, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helps them escape more easily from their predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This gives them a greater variety of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people think that he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems to make sense, because Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more water than the second largest river by more than eight times.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes with six miles of width.
A complete percentage of 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their dimensions and in the technical excellence of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most of those who work in the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of these can be discovered in nature in their native form, and they are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more like those four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also theorizes that they transform into new substances to form things that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. And of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerge, pencils have already been relegated to a lower status and use.
People now write messages on the computer screen without ever having to come close to a display case.
Just ask what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes up.
A nuclear bomb operates on the principle that it is necessary to have energy to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It is like rolling a heavy cart up a mountain. Split the nucleus again, and then, release part of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to disintegrate with little or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is about 70 km thick near and 100 km thick far away.
It is thinner below than a maria and thicker above than high ground.
It can have more maria on the closer side because the crust is thinner. It was easier to wash and rise to the surface.
Theories of content are focused on discovering what makes people awaken or attract to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want to do the things they desire and what in their environment may allow or not allow them to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors might emerge as managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to continue as "one of the friends."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, and assigning responsibility to people.
On the other side of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything that the team has been doing and transform it into their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are maintained at the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but there is a slight difference.
Members of the virtual team often function as a point of contact for your immediate physical group.
They have much more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to a flexible schedule that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is that management team to which each member is accountable. The invisible team defines standards for each member.
Why does an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One of the objectives of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized through the functional departments of an organization, creativity and commitment can be evident.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of clients.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that is being used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data present physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive investigation. Therefore, it reduces the area of investigation and makes it more rigorous.
Correlation between cerebral pathology and behavior supports scientists in their investigations.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of informational material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Despite AI having a strong connotation of scientific fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research on AI involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Izénplus includes control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to client diagnostics and queries, and also handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now used in almost many areas of the economy, medicine, engineering, and military, as there are states that can in many home computers and video game software.
A study visit is a big part of any class. Many times a teacher would like to take their students to a place where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art as if they are seated with their class.
Sharing a study visit is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year that website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a memory album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students begin their blogging experience with disorganized grammar and spelling, the presence of a general audience usually changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make an effort to improve writing to avoid criticisms.
Also, the blog "forces students to have more knowledge about the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to be knowledgeable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; through active responses to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of writings by others, as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and features a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls and to the north lies the unexplored natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things here and beyond highlight Ontario as something that is considered purely Canadian by people from outside.
The large areas further to the north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost an uninhabited desert.
For a comparison of population that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in America than Canadian citizens.
These islands of Eastern Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest remote land and a continent in its time when it comes to wild matters.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had a great influence on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It is recommended for any traveling woman to say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps a lot to wear a ring (but not the one that seems too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider harassment and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Being firm when telling others no, and not being afraid to remain firm (whether cultural differences or not, that does not make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
Moroccan sultans rebuilt the city like Daru l-Badya and gave it the name of Casablanca for the Spanish merchants who established trade bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
The return from Old Medina is easy to find a place selling traditional Moroccan products, like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, trinkets, and all kinds of knick-knacks, but all that is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which affected most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing war situation in the North Kivu province.
That city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest trackers for mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" comes to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS African Wonders Special.
That city is in strong contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic touch than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends to the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
That park has 19,500 km² and it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
It can also be good to buy a Passport Ticket, which permits entry either into a selection of parks in South Africa or into all the National Parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider as the main focus.
The profile of the buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a graph of sparkling bars that stand apparent with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbor.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite side of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonizers took as theirs, and for this reason, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the Indian interior to the coast.
The Sundarbans have already been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining settlements of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (to the other side of the river) during the day, although most, especially those going to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are almost always full, it is advisable to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
The majority of the districts are served by small Japanese buses of the Coaster brand, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, have a length of 378 meters, and two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, but it is expected for the Brazilian customs control post to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of Chaco was home to other indigenous tribal groups like the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called the "Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding by Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known because it has one of the best football teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas campus.
Tournaments and other smaller games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), its value is equivalent to a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands that is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
British pounds are usually accepted anywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
In the peripheral islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although they may accept British and American currency; check with the owners beforehand to know which method of payment is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands money outside of the islands, so exchange money before leaving the island.
I am sorry, I cannot assist with that request.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy" season and "dry" season: the amount of rain continues at that average throughout the whole year.
Although many park animals are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is, however, wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from any other wild animal!
Regardless of how they look, like deer, moose, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not keep a proper distance. This animal is large, fierce, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Beyond that, remember that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
That port was the site of a terrible naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, America, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
Every ship sinks to the bottom, except for that one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches by the sea, because of the location of two ports in Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
Beaches of the northern coastal sea (in the district of North Harbour) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the high-quality suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Those places are sometimes a beach crowded with families lined with a good variety of shops on the shore. Nothing is certain.
That main local beer is "Number One," it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. That other local beer is called "Manta."
There are a lot of French wines to drink, but wines from New Zealand and Australia travel better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easier to find if you are traveling.
For Australians, the idea of "white coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", a cappuccino comes filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
That hot chocolate is in accordance with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
They make many trips to Recife throughout the whole year, and flights due to any of those reasons to Recife are rare.
Even so, accept the advice of the authorities, obey all signals, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish are commonly found near the sea and river estuaries, from October to April in the northern part of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside these periods.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and they swim far away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
An advance reservation gives travelers the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with some hotels, although it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agents generally offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation arrangements, or the same flight and hotel packages all together.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or find other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed first through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most of the participants who go to the music festival decide to camp on-site, and most participants consider it a vital part of their experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to arrive earlier to secure a spot close to the music.
Remember that although music on the main stages may already be over, there can be festival sessions that continue playing music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in the winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice makes a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
Usually they have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment, to keep guests in a good mood, and keep them in the establishment.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, being drunk impairs judgment, and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or across mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is low and you cannot drive as if you are on normal asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall to trap you for a short time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic almost always continues without stopping throughout the entire year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
That term "safari" in popular use refers to the overland journey to see the stunning African wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to vehicles and standard equipment allows for good visualization.
Lions, hyenas and leopards are sometimes timid and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "going on foot") consists of walks, lasting for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other places throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you reserve your plane tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will remain until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Liza's wrinkled clothes can help her. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board ready to lend, even if they are not present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't like to use a wrinkled cloth, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Take care not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are different forms of water purification, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others it is necessary for many minutes.
Filters vary according to efficiency, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not familiar in their region of origin.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in some cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Proper infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or forcibly kill someone, are generally not classified as pests.
Buying duty-free items is an opportunity to purchase goods without taxes and special excise taxes in certain places.
Travelers to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a good amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents more difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which passes through many isolated forest areas.
If you are not used to driving on foreign roads, be careful: there are many steep descents, narrow lanes, and tight curves.
The speed limits set are visibly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and rigorous adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Curiously, however, mobile service is much stronger here than in many parts of the road, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, like their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are common, like apple pie throughout the year, and cherry and plum appear during the summer.
Many cooked German products also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other dried tree fruits. Popular cakes are often particularly well combined with a strong cup of tea.
If you want some doughnuts, richer, try tasting some depending on the region, they are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made only of aromatic herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior region of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is normally used in curries; in southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without more qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from the central part of the main island, Java.
Now available to every home in the entire archipelago, Javanese cuisine presents a variety of simply seasoned dishes, where the predominant flavors preferred by Javanese are peanut, soy sauce, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the foot of the rider that are attached on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the horsemen, but they may have safety issues due to the chance of a horseman's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse, but remains with one foot trapped in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs off. To minimize this risk, a set of safety measures can be taken.
First, most of the young men wear pointed boots with heels and smooth soles, very tight.
Afterwards, some saddles, particularly those English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to release from the saddle if pulled back by a rider who is falling.
Valley of Cochamó - the main climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cracks.
Today is about including breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are creating new routes among the infinite potential of the cliffs.
Snow sports in decline, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - rock paintings depict skiers dating back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was inaugurated by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski adventurers: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski excursion, or ski hiking.
It is related, but it usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, these last ones are performed on sloped terrain and require much sturdier skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a walk on a mountain path.
In good conditions, you can manage to cover distances a little further than by walking - but very rarely can you achieve skiing speeds across the country without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a continent that is more or less small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means that you have to go through many visa requests and passport controls.
The Schengen Area, however, works somewhat like a country in this sense.
Happy to stay in this area, generally you can cross the border without going through passport control points another time.
So too, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to request a separate visa for each Schengen member country, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition regarding what manufactured article is considered an antique. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
That definition has geographical variations, where the age limit can be shorter in places like America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be considered antiquities, although they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sámi, and the culture around trade is also important for other people with other professions.
Even traditionally, although not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer mainly as a draft animal.
Today many Sámi work in modern offices. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Siganu" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and erroneous perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance could be affected.
You can also want to consult the advice of other governments outside of yours, but their advice is made for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultancy is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The viewpoint presented is often superficial, general, and greatly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur in any part of the world, and there are different types of climates, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, excessive rain, and bushfires are forms and effects of bad weather, such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal meteorological phenomena include fog, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as these can impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional information.
A search on the Internet for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely provide the interest of a local company.
A course usually includes all the issues discussed here with more details, generally with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2-5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid training and, sometimes, weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about wilderness survival are common, but publications that talk about war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return journey.
Willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The goodwill of foreign governments to honor these documents is also variable.
Security checkpoints are also becoming much more intrusive in the era after September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgender people should not have to wait to go through scanners without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Currents of rupture are the return flow of waves that break in the sea, often on a reef or a similar place.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a fast current to the bottom water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue in attempting to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Without you leaving the current, returning is not more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again or, depending on your ability and having been noticed, you might want to expect to be rescued.
The re-entry shock happens earlier than the cultural shock (there are fewer honeymoon phases), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who had an easy time adapting to a new culture sometimes have a particular difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
By the time you return to your homeland after living abroad, you have already adapted to that new culture and have lost habits from your culture of origin.
When you go abroad initially, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning to their homes.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see those pyramids in the distance and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Normally, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the highest number of bases, with seventeen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island, where Villa Las Estrellas is situated.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region to the south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Mountains of the Peninsula here bend on the plateau, then turn back to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile network coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a substitute for a mobile phone, as it needs to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
That service is frequently used for transportation, including leisure crafts, and also expeditions that need data and voice communication over distances.
Your local telephone service provider should give more information regarding connection to these services.
A gap year is becoming increasingly popular for those who are planning to take a year off to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who take a gap year, or who allow themselves a year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a "sabbatical" course abroad for a year can actually improve your chances of returning to higher education in your country of origin.
Generally, there is a registration fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in archipelagos that are located along the coast.
In the archipelagos and in the lagoons, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos on the coast and the major lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
That is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most cruises to the Baltic end with an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days while you return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only travel to the islands on a cruise excursion, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany, in brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not a place close to the sea and a view of the city is not included in the cruise price list.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic event.
It is not a matter of feeling ashamed: it is not different from the fears and personal aversions of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how planes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or being out of control.
Rapid courier companies are well paid because they deliver things quickly. Many times, time is very important for commercial documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies there is a problem.
If goods were sent by air freight, on some routes it could take days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to make it go faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
That way, obviously, traveling first class or executive class is to pay a lot of money for that privilege (or, even better, get your company to pay it for you).
However, this is not going to be cheap: as a more or less general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy class fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth looking for discounts for executive or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know that there exists a certain central group of passengers who are willing to pay a good price for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is used everywhere.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but it is not recognized by any UN member countries.
Economic relations between the two parts of Moldova have been reestablished, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once it was the ancient city of Smyrna, now it is a modern, developed, and bustling center, situated by a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tile roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island Eysturoy and it has an unusual octagonal church.

It takes half an hour to walk to that interesting village.
To the north and with easy access is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a brilliant account of its splendors was recorded by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and it stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Sanctuary), a famous Marian apparition site known worldwide.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a place of common value, and also a place that has an almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived that time, and many more who had loved ones who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat that place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not disfigure that place by marking or scratching with graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signage is indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made only in Catalan, but planned disruptions are made by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is still to act like someone who is "well-mannered". It makes life much easier.
The brusque appearance of Parisians evaporates quickly if you display some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests, mainly with trees like beech, fir, and pine, and it has a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a great variety of plant communities, due to their variety of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitude levels.
That area is also home to a large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, crane, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie can be found there, together with many more common species.
In the manner of visiting churches, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most cloaks are given to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in a light color, you will receive a smile from the nun or the brother at the entrance.
In the same line, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
That can also be borrowed from the stock right at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each person uses them, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like in similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple popular meal, especially during summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with oil, tomato, and any available condiments like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, together with the word "Sie" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and complements.
It also facilitates reading, although writing is something so complicated for the need to discover if a verb or an adjective is used as a noun.
Pronunciation is very easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
Those main letters must be careful with them being c and g, since the pronunciation varies based on the vowel that comes after.
Besides that, don't forget to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Portuguese language has a grammar that is more or less easy and, almost always, regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar booklet will help you learn many things about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It is not necessary to say that knowing a Romance language makes it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who understand a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is sufficiently similar not to need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today, and they become museums or places of education.
Like light pollution in its aura is not the type of problem that it is nowadays, they are usually localized in cities or on university campuses, it is easier to reach than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern research telescopes are large installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
That concept comes from China, where the plum flower was the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor solely for him and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants are in their best condition when they are in a natural environment, so resisting the temptation to pick even "just one" sample.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, picking "specimens" also makes you expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But being placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, but rarer).
There are also some buses that go north, to Hebron, the traditional place where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Ask that bus if it is thinking about going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
River routes in the interior could be a good theme for organizing a fair.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or sail by boat through the entire Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth date of Jesus.
Many traditions around this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the night of Easter awake in some viewpoints to watch the sunrise.
It is clear that there is a theological explanation around Christian tradition for this, but it could also very well be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the congregation frequently attending celebrations around midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
Every animal that arrived on the islands for the first time came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which makes the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galápagos.
Since men arrived in the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, since the sky is dark for about 24 hours a day.
Since those areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can manage to appreciate the stars.
The work culture of the Japanese is more hierarchical and formal than what Western people might be accustomed to.
Fatu is the standard work attire, and coworkers address each other by their surname or by their job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, and efforts should be focused on group achievements rather than individual accomplishments.
Workers often have to get their superior's approval for any decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superior's instructions without question.
