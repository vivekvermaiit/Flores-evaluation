And this not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, and this is a previously widespread theory, but it is not possible to provide details such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the color of this animal's feathers is chestnut brown from above with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The discovery also provides a sharp insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given the lack of inclusion of the dinosaur feather shaft in an evolved vertebral column, called "rachis", but it has another feature - the quills and barbules - researchers concluded that the column might have evolved gradually after these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used during flight but rather for regulating or displaying temperature. Researchers proposed that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimens show mature feathers and not the small fluffy down.

The director of public prosecution, Mr. Kier Starmer (Queen's Counsel), gave a statement this morning announcing the trial of both Huhne and Pryce.
Huhne resigned and Ed Davey, the deputy in the Council of Ministers, will take his place, and it is expected that deputy Norman Lamb will accept the position of Minister of Business that Davey is leaving.
And Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on the 16th of February.
The deceased were Nicholas Alden, aged 25 years, and Zachary Cuddeback, aged 21 years, with Cuddeback being the driver.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw while Kristoffer Schneider requires reconstructive surgery for his face.
Uka's weapon was lowered while it was pointed at the head of a man in his fifties. Schneider suffers from continuous pain, is blind in one of his eyes, and has lost part of his skull, and his face was rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from the American Air Force base in his homeland.
After Wednesday's events, Carpenedo competed in two individual events in the championship.
Her first race was a slalom race, where she was unable to reach the finish line in her first round. A total of 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
And she witnessed her last race, the Giant Slalom race, where she occupied the tenth position in the women's group with a total time of 4:41.30, slower than the first place winner by 2:11.60 minutes, the Austrian Klaudia Loesch, and by 1:09.02 minutes from the ninth place holder Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four competitors from the women's group failed to complete their rounds, and 45 out of 117 competitors failed to achieve a ranking in the Giant Slalom race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Syrian woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop as well."
And the names of the accused have been mentioned as follows, and they are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
And Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused have appeared before the court and their faces were covered.
Despite the presence of three people inside the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
Except for the driver who was injured with serious wounds to his head.
The road that witnessed the occurrence of the accident was temporarily closed while the emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT car.
He was initially transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
And since that time, Adekoya has appeared before the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh on the charge of killing her son.
This lady is detained pending the issuance of the charges list and the trial, but any evidence from eyewitnesses may be fabricated because her image was widely circulated.
And this practice is considered common in other places in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works in a different way, and the court considered that publishing the pictures is likely to be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "it seems that journalists take a dangerous path if they publish pictures and the like of those suspected."
The Public Prosecution Office, responsible for judicial prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no comment will be made under any circumstances until the accusation is directed.
The document will indicate -for release- to the border dispute that Palestine uses based on the borders before the 1967 war.
And it is said that the other topics that were discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years immediately upon the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian authority agrees to limit this presence to only five years.
The forest guards should have supervised against deception in the trials of complementary pest control management, where the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In the partnership established between the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Sporting Shooters' Association in Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers have been employed as part of the hunting program affiliated with the Sporting Shooters' Association (NSW).
According to what Mick O'Flynn, the acting manager of park conservation and heritage with NPWS, mentioned, the four teams selected for the first controlled burn operation received comprehensive instructions on safety and training.
Yesterday, the hunter swore the oath of office before a newly formed electoral council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It is the fifth interim election council for Martelly within four years.
And one of the main committees recommended last month the resignation of the previous provisional electoral council as part of a set of measures to move the country forward towards conducting new elections.
The committee was convened as a response from Martelly to the widespread protests opposed to the regime that broke out in October.
Protests erupted, which were sometimes violent due to the failure to hold elections, and some were scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating in malfunctioning iPod devices have been reported, resulting in a total of 6 fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that she was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the METI organization announced that Apple Inc. reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not dangerous."
The minister responded, standing, describing the delay by Apple company as "extremely regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at exactly 07:19 AM local time (which is 09:19 PM on Friday Greenwich Mean Time "GMT").
The Office of Disaster Management in Northern Mariana mentioned that it has not received any reports of damage occurring in the country.
As the Tsunami Warning Center in the Pacific Ocean said, there are no indications of a Tsunami occurring.
A former Filipino policeman held two tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire from his M16 rifle on tourists.
A number of hostages have been rescued and it has been confirmed that at least six have died so far.
Six hostages were released, among them children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers caught up with an elderly lady because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and practiced the profession of medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
After finishing his work at the hospital, Liggins began researching the field of premature birth during his free time.
His research showed that if the hormone is given, it will accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found one of the flight recording devices, the "black box," on Wednesday.
The colleagues, the wrestlers, also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer mentioned: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme festival. She was the first manager. Luna passed away on a night when the moon was shining brightly, and it was a unique night, just like her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, saying: "Luna was eccentric like me... and maybe more so... I loved her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among 1,400 people included in the poll before the 2010 federal elections, the number of opponents who want Australia to become a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her belief that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the participants in this opinion poll wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
It was decided that the person holding the gold medal for the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle swimming events across three rounds in the Commonwealth Games would be questioned, but after a complaint, doubts were raised about his eligibility.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain as their use was prohibited during participation in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
A number of people have managed to make a discovery using different devices and programs by the beginning of the month of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth alongside the organic compounds that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists are interested in understanding how planets form, especially how the Earth formed when comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, aged 53, began his position as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
And he referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
He is expected to run for presidency in the year 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on satellites instead of the old radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide more accurate information to pilots.
Do not use additional transport means and trains will not stop above ground in Wembley, as car parks and waiting and boarding facilities are not available on the ground.
And it raised concerns about the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors without the team's audience.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
A researcher from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden stated that new species evolved in just two generations, despite it being previously believed that this process would take much longer, due to the crossbreeding between Darwin's finch and the medium ground finch, the small immigrant cactus finch, and the large cactus ground finch.
Gold can be crafted into all shapes. And it can be folded into small forms.
It can be stretched into a fine thread so that it can be wrapped and knotted. It can be folded or rolled into sheets.
It can be extremely thin and attached to another metal. It can be made extremely thin because it is sometimes used to decorate images hand-drawn in books called "manuscripts."
This is called the pH of the chemical substance. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical substance.
The concentration of hydrogen ions (as the pH) refers to the pH level in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions consist of protons that have been stripped of their electrons (where hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and a single electron).
Mix the two powders together, then press them into a ball shape with damp and clean hands.
The moisture present on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a pleasant feeling and providing you with a kind of protection.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro each had a flushing toilet system in almost every house connected to an advanced sanitation system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the homes of the cities of Mycenae Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of the public baths, where men and women would share the baths together.
Whenever you communicate with someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives the communication signal in space, then retransmits it almost instantaneously.
The satellite is sent into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and visibility.
The task requires a giant rocket that exceeds 100 feet in height to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The invention of the wheel has changed the face of the world in remarkable ways. The most important thing the wheel has provided us with is easier and faster means of transportation.
She provided us with the train, the cars, and several other means of transportation.
There exists a range of medium-sized pieces that feed on medium-sized prey starting from rabbits and reaching wolves and gazelles.
Recently, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat the most numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of specialization, which means defining specific work tasks for each segment, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are distinguished by being the most socially structured cats, living in large groups called "prides".
Prides of lions consist of one to three adult males, in addition to up to thirty females and cubs.
The women usually form strong bonds with each other, and you find them to be a large family supporting the sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, and other animals greatly resemble lions in their behavior (but this does not include other big cats), and they are also extremely deadly to their prey.
The tiger, by virtue of its flexible body, can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with a strength five times that of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Genus Panthera) that includes lions, leopards, and American jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that produce a roaring sound.
The roar of the tiger does not exactly resemble the roar of the lion, but it is more like a combination of a growl and a scream.
The "tiger" family loves eating small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, frogs, and birds if they can. All the animals they hunt are generally much smaller than them in size.
Scientists believe that the Ocelot tracks animals through its sense of smell to find and eat them (prey), and it detects their presence on the ground.
It can see well in the dark with night vision and also move with great stealth. Cats mostly hunt their prey by blending into the details of the surrounding environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small community) becomes isolated from the main group from which it came (if it moved to a new island and cannot easily return from it), it often finds itself in an environment different from what it was in before.
This new environment contains different resources and diverse competitors. Therefore, the new residents will need various traits or adjustments to be stronger competitors than before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, and they still need the means of self-adaptation that they previously required.
And with the passage of time, when new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, their appearance becomes less frequent, just like other residents.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In the year 1767, the first fully iron railroad was introduced.
This process is called the process of recombination, which is used to prevent the formation of new species. Recombination is considered an inevitable result and is an extremely important part of the process of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans inhale and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., the breath).
Plants make their food from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, and similarly, we make our clothes from plants. Most of the foods we consume are from plants. And animals cannot survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its time, therefore it did not fear anything except for other Mosasaurs.
The long jaw was studded with more than 70 dagger-like teeth, in addition to an extra set of teeth found in its upper jaw, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know the matter for certain, but perhaps it had a forked tongue. Its diet may have included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it was a predator of human flesh.
Even a behemoth like the T. rex, "the Tyrannosaurus rex," could not withstand an attack of anything that touches water.
While you may find that most Roman foods are familiar to us, you will notice that they had unusual or uncommon dishes during festivals, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of dormouse called the zaghiba.
The most significant difference was that while the poor and women were eating their meals seated on chairs, the wealthy men preferred to hold banquets together, where they would recline on their sides while consuming their meals.
It is not possible for ancient Roman meals to include the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Greeks did not taste pomegranates.
The Babylonians built for each of their primary deities a dwelling which was considered a residence for the gods.
People used to present sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through festivals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, towers were specially built in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the towers was considered a sacred place for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home does not represent significant importance.
Most Jewish families lived an unsettled life.
The women were roaming in the courtyard, and the shops were just open windows overlooking the street; stones were used for building the houses.
There were no vast forests in the land of Canaan, so the price of wood was extremely high.
Greenland was settled heavily. In the Scandinavian sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on charges of murder, and when he traveled to the west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Despite the fact that all these countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might believe that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
And yet, this is not correct. Despite something being written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, there is a phrase that says: "The original Declaration of Independence dated September 4, 1776." The text appears on the document upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that it was written recently, as the wrapping of the large manuscript document (which measures 29 3/4 by 24 1/2 in time) was done for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that I would add the coding simply as a symbol.
The Normandy landings and the following battles resulted in the liberation of northern France, but the south had not been liberated at that time.
It was ruled by "Fascist" France. These are the French who made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers in their work instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
The Americans and the Free French forces liberated the south of France in a period not exceeding two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, meaning a society.
The word "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil and is connected to the Latin word "civis," meaning citizen, as well as "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it also defines, to some extent, the size of the society.
Cities of nations are the ancestors of peoples. Civilization means the transfer of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural mark, and the dissemination of justice.
Often, minority cultures disappear without leaving historical evidence that can be linked to them, failing to be recognized as appropriate heritages.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States formed for the first time a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - pursuant to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and due to the absence of national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were mostly uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
It did not have the authority to override laws, taxes, and customs tariffs between the states.
The proposal for the materials was unanimously approved by all the states to amend them, and the central government took it so lightly that its representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is considered the second most successful team in the world, having been crowned World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, tennis, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in northern regions where athletes compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan includes approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Given the group of islands present in Japan, it is often referred to geographically as the "Archipelago."
Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, and began transitioning to the practice of producing cash crops and employing Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas in Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province belonging to the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
In the year 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it relinquished sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main stone structures, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The reconstruction of most of the buildings located on the outskirts of the complex provided a better image for tourism grants than their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, and it was the dominant film size at the end of the era of analog film.
Its production continues to this day, but more importantly, the width-to-height ratio is the same ratio that the configuration of the digital camera sensor acquired.
The 35 mm format is actually approximately a rectangular shape, with a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
Therefore, it is mentioned that the aspect ratio of this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many popular ratios (for example, the APS formatting group) equal or approximate this height-to-width ratio.
The triangular base—which is often used and frequently utilized in most cases—is a simple guiding principle from which a dynamic movement arises while maintaining a degree of organization in the image.
He states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal parts (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, underwent scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has connected European countries together despite differences in language and customs.
Her rising power has impressed everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that resources should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial funds are specifically designated for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and the concentration of power and wealth there has led many to question whether this doctrine has been actually implemented according to it.
After a brief period following the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to impose a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy has proven its effectiveness, as it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade being a violation of international law, which has been ratified in general form, and recorded in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
And given the limited response to these maneuvers, Germany expected a similar reaction to the unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In the year 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of depicting different periods of time; each stage of Chinese history or each dynasty in power was distinctively characterized by a ruling lineage.
There was also an unstable era among each dynasty for the divided regions. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, a fierce war broke out among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is considered one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, as thousands of individuals met their deaths fighting for the throne at the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects that occurred, such as: the use of the metric system, the transition from absolute monarchy to republican and national governance, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and outstanding to succeed.
The same applies to the army because instead of relying on the military rank, they now depend on the degrees of distinction and importance.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many of the oppressed working class in other countries, prompting them to begin igniting their own revolutions.
Muhammad paid significant attention to matters beyond this worldly natural life. He frequently visited a cave known as "Hira" on the Mountain of Light to contemplate the universe.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, vividly represents the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad (PBUH).
The cave is located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not easy to find at all, even if an individual already knows of its existence. As soon as you enter the cave, you are in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the beautiful clear sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century BC is one of many large sacred structures that were constructed to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Pyramids" area in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings includes many pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid) and many small tombs, as well as a collection of temples and the great Sphinx statues.
The Great Pyramid was constructed as a form of tribute to Pharaoh Khufu, while a number of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol "the upper bracket" resembles the letter V, and the symbol "the lower bracket" resembles a grid or a square without its lower side.
What is meant by the word "upper" is that you should start from the tip and pull the bow, and the word "lower" means that you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow), and consider the bow.
Usually, the upper arch produces a softer sound, whereas the lower arch is stronger and more resolute.
Do not hesitate to draw your markings with a pencil, but remember that the following curvature marks exist for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
In an atmosphere of fear, a mob forced the royal family of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Mary Therese, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, to return to Paris on the 6th of October, 1789.
They traveled on horseback back to Paris and were surrounded by a large crowd of people shouting and cheering with threats targeting the King and Queen.
The crowds forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their car all the way.
Once, a member of the gang gestured towards the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people have paid for themselves what the American imperialist war cost in the invasion of the Philippines.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear a large part of the costs and interest on the bonds that were floated in the name of the Philippine government through banking institutions on Wall Street.
Naturally, the enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the fundamental gains for American imperialism.
In order to understand the truth about the Knights Templar, one must be aware of the context that led to the establishment of this order.
The era in which the events took place is referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
It was preceded by the early Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which ended - as is known - around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, starting with the technological drive or technological necessity and ending with the precise meaning that the fate of humans is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural and political influence, and that this technology, in turn, "influences" traditional societies, rather than being influenced by society.
For example, a person might say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically efficient for a small number of cars, therefore new production methods for roads have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread increase in car ownership rates also leads to a rise in accident rates on the roads, which results in the invention of new technologies in the field of healthcare to treat bodies that have sustained damage.
Romanticism had a great deal of cultural determinism, derived from the works of authors like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography developed, and sometimes the best compatibility with the status of society arose from laws imposed in an arbitrary manner.
Although Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital in Medieval Europe.
Her fame began as it became a center for luxury around the year 1100 AD.
Its importance declined into the 12th century, primarily due to the return of the Crusaders bringing gifts such as silk and spices, whose values were higher than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the transfer of the title of the capital of fashion from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The art of embroidery reached its peak during the period between the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Nevertheless, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western patterns may lag behind the schedule by approximately 25-30 years.
With the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own distinctive style. Among the major developments of that time—resulting from the Crusades—people began to use buttons for fastening their clothes.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, that uses local heirloom seeds combined with techniques like crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase yields.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, and is often organic, using native preserved seeds in ecological areas in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers worked in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals in thought who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
A subculture may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of its members.
It may be that the characteristic which defines a distinct subculture is linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender-based, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their affiliation through the distinctive and symbolic use of a certain style, which includes fashion, behavior, and dialects.
One of the most common ways used to demonstrate the importance of social upbringing is to rely on a small number of unfortunate cases of children who were not socially developed by adults during their growth, through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse.
These children are often labeled as "feral" or wild. Some of these feral children were abandoned by individuals (usually their parents). In some cases, this abandonment was due to the parents' inability to handle the child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have been subjected to mistreatment or severe trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
It is alleged that there are individuals who were adopted by animals, and it is mentioned that some have lived in the wild alone.
Because of being raised by animals away from humans, the feral child exhibits behaviors (insensitivity to physical boundaries) exactly similar to the behaviors of certain caregiving animals, such as the fear of humans or indifference towards them.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more exciting, the benefits go far beyond that.
Heavy burdens are not a way to learn, but they are an aid that provides support to individuals who are going through a new educational experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The obstacles can be both hypothetical and real at the same time, in other words, the teacher is a form of an obstacle, just like the little man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are integrated into the program and aim to pose and stimulate questions, and explain the procedures that may be difficult for the student to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should be raised in an environment that does not care about education, nurture, and learning, yet they do so.
We understand that the foster care system is a safe environment for these children.
The sponsorship system is supposed to provide a safe home, caregivers who are kind and affectionate, a stable educational system, and reliable healthcare.
The host family is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the house they previously lived in.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and personal communication.
The distinctive features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage method and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "social development" have been proposed as important motives for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries related to the interpretation of subtle expressions and facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
Specifically, he claims that it is possible for a person to discover whether someone is lying by accurately interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his statement "the president's speech" how individuals who are unable to comprehend speech due to brain damage are nevertheless capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
Rather, he suggests that such ability in explaining human behavior can also be shared by animals such as domesticated dogs.
A study conducted during the twentieth century revealed that there are two types of genetic diversity: hidden and apparent.
Mutation adds new genetic variation and its removal is caused by selection from the expressed variation pool.
The class operates and reconfiguration alternates variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
Outside of the savanna pastures, it is difficult for the herbivores that have a digestive system similar to humans to meet their requirements for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, the failure to do so has dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately inevitable death.
The most accessible plant resources were the proteins, which can be found in tree leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for the main ones, for example, to digest them unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a good amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
If we consider all matters, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and then sleeping again after a short time (10-60 minutes).
It is possible to do that easily by using a relatively low-volume alarm to bring you back to consciousness without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself repeatedly pressing the snooze button while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythm include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, one of the well-known diuretics) before sleeping, which forces a person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more positive the vital forces are. Every person has the ability to achieve absolute peace and feel complete satisfaction.
It is possible for everyone to achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is tension and negativity.
Tibetan medicine relies on Buddha's teachings; however, it has expanded through the path of love offered by Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
From the outset, the Tibetan Buddhism is extremely simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) awakens via yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations.
The Tibetan treatment center specializes in the practice of tantric methods. The purification of energy channels is conducted through embodying different deities, activating the chakras (the body's seven energy centers), and enlightening awareness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. With the end of the war, clashes between systems, operations, and cultures led to the disintegration of countries.
Former allies have become enemies now, two years after the end of the war, and the Cold War has begun.
It was supposed to last for 40 years and fight in a real sense, by using military allies, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had effectively collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
And yet, this plan became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is considered the most efficient method for transporting large loads of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional missions of naval forces traditionally focused on ensuring your country's ability to transport people and goods, while simultaneously working to disrupt your enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II is one of the most prominent modern examples worth mentioning. The Americans tried to transport men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this movement, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to invade Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were domesticated for the first time nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve it due to the ease of access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Usually, domestic goat farming was conducted in plots that roamed hills or other grazing areas, and they were often tended by goat herders who were typically children or teenagers, akin to the most famous shepherd. These herding methods are still in use today.
The horse-drawn carriages were made in England in the early sixteenth century.
Despite the fact that the chariots were composed only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speed and carry heavier loads than those that traveled on the more rugged roads of today.
Installation conditions were provided early enough to fix the paths in place. However, I realize that the paths would be more efficient if they had an iron plate on top.
This practice has become widespread, but iron caused more corrosion in the wooden wheels of the wagon.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In the year 1767, the first complete railways were introduced.
The first means of transportation known to history is walking, where humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of upright humans (meaning humans with an upright stature).
Their ancestors did not descend from the Australopithecus (the upright-standing apes as commonly thought).
Species with bipedalism were discovered in Australopithecus excavations dating from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, despite the fact that Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs since seven million years ago.
We can begin to live in greater harmony with the environment, and we can join the environmental movement, as it is also within our capacity to become activists for the sake of alleviating future burdens in many ways.
This matter is very much like treating a disease accompanied by symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the roots of the problem and solve it.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to scientific progress and technology for humanity, and problems have become greater due to the population increase and the demanding lifestyle of humans.
After its approval by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and the Secretary General was sent a few buildings away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document by John Nixon took place in Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, and he read it before his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25th Dunlap call that still exists is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a single group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them "birds."
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and are capable of flight.
But there are many things in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
It has legs with scales and claws, lays eggs, and walks on its hind legs like a T-Rex.
All currently used computer systems rely effectively on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
The binary number can contain only one value out of two possible values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers – or bits, for use in computer language.
The interior design may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as nausea are usually not sufficient to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poor interior design might be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bugs" in the official sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the old term "bed bug," which is an insect that has greatly adapted to parasitize humans.
All bed bugs and dangerous insects are nesting species, and they adapt to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis than males.
The couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to develop a plan for adopting a child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main aim of science is represented in understanding the way the world works through the scientific method. This approach actually works to guide most scientific research.
However, conducting experiments alone is not sufficient, as experimentation is like a test used to eliminate one or more probable hypotheses and pose questions, just as making observations directs scientific research as well.
Scientists of nature and philosophers have focused on classical texts, particularly the Holy Scripture in Latin.
Aristotle's viewpoint was accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Often, many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior fundamentally depend on the presence of internal intrinsic cycles, which are regulated through the biological clock.
A mechanism documenting the natural and regular organization method for reproduction has occurred for most living organisms, which is not limited to responding to external periodic signals, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is an inherent oscillating mechanism that will continue to operate for a period even in the absence of external signals when riding a free-running cycle.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was considered one of the main hypotheses emphasizing that nucleic acid is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their nucleic acid into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to distinguish nucleic acids in viruses using radioactive phosphorus or protein with radioactive sulfur.
A mutation can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material segments, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Mutations in germ line cells can only be passed to children, while mutations can cause cell death or cancer elsewhere in the body.
Nature-based tourism attracts individuals interested in visiting natural areas for the enjoyment of natural landscapes, including both plant and animal wildlife.
Activities include examples such as hunting wildlife and fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of that is visiting orangutan habitats, photographing them, and getting to know them in Borneo.
Every morning, people travel from the small town to their workplaces, and others pass by them whose work destination is the place they just left.
In the dynamic transport hub of Makkah, everything is connected in some way to a transport system that relies on and supports private cars.
Current science indicates that this enormous carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
Rarely do you hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or fallen bridges.
Why do transportation systems create such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are the transport engineers not competent, or is there something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movements of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are considered difficult because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a stable range reasonably; thus, traffic flows tend to a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
To represent the flow of traffic more efficiently, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, (3) speed (1) flow (2) speed.
These relations assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies easily and efficiently, search for food, and find mates for reproduction more effectively.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings again along the length of their bodies.
This matter grants it a wide range of small places for hiding from the predatory animals.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings now are the tsetse fly and the mayfly.
A man named Aristarchus mentioned thousands of years ago that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people believed that he was correct, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems logical, because the earth does not appear to be moving, isn't that so?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on the face of the Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water carried by the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also considered the widest river on the face of the earth, with a width reaching six miles in some areas.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main length of the Amazon River reaches 6,387 km (3980 miles). It works on gathering water from thousands of small rivers.
Despite the continuation of pyramid construction with stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and artistic distinction in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least in terms of population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official statements.
The Italian language is also the language that is used by most people working in the country, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in their original form and extracted relatively simply using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more elements from four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (respectively): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, despite the fact that he also assumed that they would transform into new substances different from what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
It appeared very small to the extent that trillions of it could fit with the dot at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
And unfortunately, with the emergence of new methods of writing, the pencil has decreased in status and usage.
People now write messages on computer screens without the need to approach the pen.
A person can only wonder about what the painting of keys will become when something new arrives.
Explosive devices work according to the principle of using energy to form nuclei with a number of protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Redistributing the energy once more leads to releasing some of this energy.
Some nuclei contain isotopes that are unstable, which means that they tend to decay with little or no rolling.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the Earth's crust ranges from 70 km on the lower side to 100 km on the maximum side.
There are fewer fish under the dark area (Maria), and more fish under the elevations.
There may be more from the dark region (maria) on the near side, because the thinner crust has made it easier for volcanic lava to ascend to the surface.
The content theory revolves around discovering what maintains or attracts people.
This theory sees that people have specific needs and/or desires that are fulfilled when they reach the stage of maturity.
This theory examines the things that make specific individuals desire the things they do, and about the elements present in their environment that make them perform specific actions or refrain from doing them.
There are two widespread theories for content: Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, behaviors may appear when managers begin to lead their former peers. One side of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager faces difficulties in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary procedures, conducting performance evaluations, defining responsibilities, and holding individuals accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the person transforms into an individual who is unrecognizable and feels that he must change everything that the team has done and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of distinction that traditional teams are subject to, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They generally enjoy greater independence than traditional team members, as their teams often meet according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The existence of an "invisible team" is also a unique element for the virtual team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The invisible team is the management team that every member follows. The invisible team sets the standards for each member individually.
Why might the organization be interested in going through a lengthy process to establish an educational organization? One of the objectives of setting organizational learning concepts as implementation topics is innovation.
When using all available resources efficiently through the institutional job management, innovation and creativity emerge.
As a result, working together can lead the organization to overcome obstacles, resulting in an innovative new process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains how the Continuum method is used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neural biological data provide empirical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating cognitive processes. This, in turn, narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The relationship between neuroscience and behavior works to support scientists in their research.
It has been long known that there are different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors that affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see the structure of the brain and the processes it performs, and to verify all of these things in an unprecedented way.
This matter provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence carries strong connotations of science fiction, it constitutes a highly important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
The research in artificial intelligence involves creating tools to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
It includes examples of control, planning, and scheduling, and the ability to respond to client diagnoses and their inquiries, in addition to recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate specializations that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are often used currently in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and military, as it has been designed in numerous software applications and home video games.
Field trips are considered a large part of any study course. Often, a teacher likes to take her students to places where a bus trip is not a suitable option.
Technology offers the solution through virtual field trips. Students can take a look at archaeological sections in the museum, or visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine arts while sitting with their classmates in the study hall.
Field trip participation is considered a great way to reflect on trips and to exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned each year, but previous editions are kept online as a record of stories.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Given that students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins striving to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
As blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to attract the audience's attention inspires students to be smart and distinctive (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend the scope of learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through active engagement with online content, students can determine their positions within the context of the writings of others, in addition to identifying their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada, bilingual, and includes a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase the history of Canada in the past and present.

All of these things and more make Ontario stand out as what expatriates consider truly Canadian at its core.
The vast areas located in the north are characterized by a low population density, while others are almost uninhabited.
A comparison that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
The country of Madagascar is considered the largest without rival, and it is like a continent on its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are considered independent countries or are associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
When the Arabs came to the country with peace, Islam greatly predominated over the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European expansion and colonization began in the fifteenth century, where the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to Asia, leading to India.
The region stretches from the northern side along the coast, and from the south and west along the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for any female traveler to say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is also beneficial to wear a ring (not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women must realize that cultural differences may lead to what they might consider harassment, and among the uncommon matters are following her or grabbing her by the arm, and things like that.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to defend your position (whether there are cultural differences or not, for that does not make the matter normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish traders called it Casablanca (addar al-bayda2) who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Throughout the old city, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, and shisha, plus a full range of trivial items, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, volcanic lava emitted from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed the city of Goma, covering most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
In general, the city of Goma is reasonably safe, but it is necessary to explore any visits outside Goma to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also considered a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo with some of the cheapest gorilla trekking routes in Africa.
You can use a boda boda (a motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The regular (local) fare is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for distant foreign lands.
Timbuktu is considered a poor city today, despite the fact that its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and there is also an airport there.
In the year 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' program about the wonders of the African world on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the country’s cities because it is characterized by an Arab nature more than an African one.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, extending across the borders of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered on the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It represents one of the main attraction areas in Southern Africa and is considered one of the most prominent national parks in Southern Africa (SANParks).
As is the case with all national parks in South Africa, there are maintenance and daily entrance fees for the park.
An individual may also benefit from purchasing a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selected group of parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong grants the Hong Kong region its name and it is the place that many tourists consider the main focal point of interest.
The series of buildings that embrace the skyline of Hong Kong resembles a brilliant chart that reflects its image on the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, cross the island and head towards the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the urban development areas of Hong Kong Island are covered by reclaimed land along the northern shoreline.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as a private place for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence about the colonial past of the region, this is a good place to start your mission.
The Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal belt formed of mangrove trees in the world, extending to a distance of 80 kilometers (50 miles) within the delta regions in Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining tiers of the great jungles that covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, with water/swamps covering about one-third of it.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
The buses leave the station between the areas (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those heading east to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Considering that intercity buses are often fully booked, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas enjoy the service of small Japanese Coaster buses, which are characterized by comfort and durability.
Shared taxi cars are considered a fast and comfortable means for traveling to nearby places, such as Paro District (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is considered a suspension bridge. The Oyapock River extends to connect the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, and their length is 378 meters, and they include two paths with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It was decided to operate the bridge at full capacity in September 2017, and at that time the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs inspection points is expected.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now known as Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic fishermen and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who remained alive by relying on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay, which was formerly called "the Giant Province of the Indies," was born from the womb of the war raging between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the indigenous population.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for about three centuries.
Since the founding of the city of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its natural character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The major championship for this year will be held in December on the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
It is also possible to watch the championships and smaller matches here at other times of the year.
To obtain news about championships and places to buy polo match tickets, have a look at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged at a value equal to that of the British pound sterling (GBP).
Funds can be spent at the only bank on the island, which is headquartered in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted at any location in the islands, as are Stanley credit cards and the US dollar accepted frequently.
It is possible that credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, despite the possibility of dealing with British and American currency; it is necessary to check with the owners in advance to determine the acceptable method of payment.
It may be impossible to trade Falkland Islands currency and exchange it outside the islands, so it is advisable to exchange money before leaving the islands.
And given that the city of Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
The city of Montevideo is located in the subtropical regions; in the summer season, the temperatures are above +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely dip below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel much colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons per se, meaning that the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, their lives must remain wild, and these animals should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
Regardless of their tamability, cats can attack deer, American elk, bison, and almost all large animals.
Every year, dozens of visitors sustain injuries due to the lack of appropriate distance between them. These are large wild animals and are likely to be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition to that, you must understand that scents attract flies and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or preparing foods with strong odors and maintain the cleanliness of the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000 people.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave Germany.
All ships sank except for one British ship. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, given that Auckland is located between two harbors. The most famous of them are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them have pohutukawa tree shades.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are crowded at times with a number of shops lined up along the shores. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", and it is not a complex beer, but it is enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many types of French beverages, but the types of New Zealand and Australian beverages can be transported abroad in a better condition.
Locally sourced tap water is completely safe to drink, but finding bottled water can be a challenge if you are concerned.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign to them. The light black coffee is "espresso," the cappuccino comes full of crema (and not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate drinks rise to the Belgian standards. The prices of fruit juices are considered high, but they are wonderful.
Numerous trips are organized to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries for any reason among these causes to the coral reefs rarely occur.
Always adhere to all signs, receive advice and guidance from the authorities, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the city of 1770. It can sometimes be found outside these times.
There are indeed sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not enjoy living in the ocean, as their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking grants the traveler peace of mind by knowing that he will have a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you may find that it is possible to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites, through the travel agent.
