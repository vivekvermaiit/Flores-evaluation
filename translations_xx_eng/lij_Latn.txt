This here does not confirm only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely spread theory, but it provides details that fossils alone can't, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
Scientists said that the fur of these animals was chestnut-brown on top, with the underside being carrot-colored.
The discovery allows a look into the evolution of colors in birds.
Before the dinosaur feathers developed a well-defined shaft, called a rachis, they had other types of feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers deduce that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to these other types.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or for display. The researchers have proposed that, while this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the example shows the feathers of a large one and not the fluff of a chick.
Researchers have proposed that, although this is the tail of an unknown dinosaur, the specimen shows the bones of a large one and not the fragments of a chicken.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth, place a pre-printed paper sheet indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting register.

The white ballots allow the sending of representatives to attend every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

The decree provided that violent video games sold in the state of California be marked with a "18" label and that their sale to a minor be punishable with a fine of $1000 for each violation.
The Director of Public Prosecution, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning announcing the prosecution of both Huhne and Pryce.
Chris Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the ministry for Employment and Pensions. Davey is without a portfolio.
Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates Court on the 16th of February.
The dead are Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla had injuries to an arm and the jaw, such that Kristoffer Schneider required reconstructive surgery for his face.
The UK's army failed so much that it was ranked behind a fifth man. Schneider has two long fingers, is blind in one eye, a missing section of the skull, and a titanium-reconstructed face.
Schneider testified via videolink from a USAF base in his homeland.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual races at the championships.
The first was the slalom, where he got a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the maximum result in that race.
Last week, the giant slalom ended in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's group did not manage to finish their race, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to classify themselves in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who assaulted a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and her laptop."
The dolls are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendants appeared before the court with covered faces.
Even though three people were inside the house, when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
Every morning, the driver has complained of a severe headache.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed while the emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
At the beginning, it had been taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was relocated to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya is now in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh charged with the accusation of having killed her son.
He is in custody awaiting the indictment and the trial, but if any testimonial evidence could be contaminated, it is proven that his image is being published everywhere.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice functions differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes that "journalists tread on a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for criminal prosecutions, has stated to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least the indictment.
The document, according to the leak of information, referred to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 war borders in the Middle East.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after signing an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority accepts to allow this presence for only five years.
The tests in the additional disinfestation had to be strictly supervised by the rangers, so much so that the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited as part of the hunting program by the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director in charge of the Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first operation of the year have received comprehensive instruction in safety and training.
Martelly has already seen himself in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members.
It is the first CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests, which began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, have been triggered by the improper conduct of elections, some of which go back to 2011.
There have been reported over 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods, which have caused a total of six fires and left four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has said that he was notified of 27 incidents related to the instrument.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company has called "non-serious."
The minister has responded by calling the delay of the Apple report "unacceptable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT according to the updated time zone on Friday).
The office for emergency management in Northern Mariana has stated that no emergencies have been reported in that state.
Also the Tsunami Attention Center in the Pacific has stated that there was no tsunami risk.
A former Filipino police officer, no longer in service, held Hong Kong tourists hostage after taking control of their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Various hostages have been saved and, for now, six at least have not been reported as dead.
Six hostages, among others the children and an elder, have been released early, just like the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down with firearms.
Liggins was born close to his parents' footsteps and started his career in medicine.
He studied obstetrics and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins started studying the work of prematures in his free time.
I am researching the broad bean which, if a hormone was administered, would accelerate the fetal respiratory maturation of the child.
Xinhua reports that government investigators have recovered two black box flight recorders from the crash site.
The fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna went away on a night with two moons. Beautiful and unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "the Moon was strange like me... maybe never more... I loved her and lost her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this opinion, and wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those interviewed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his issues with his form, it has been in doubt.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to overcome his illness, after they were banned by the authorities.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of the date of January 25th.
Many people have verified the discovery with various hardware and software checks, and it was announced on Tuesday.
And how they could have been sources of water. Arrived on this earth together with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
The sciences hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, since comets collided with the ancient Earth.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship at the start of this year, and last month he signed a law that legalizes marriage between people of the same sex.
He has defined the voices as "of gossip and of political foolishness".
It is speculated that he is running for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA supports that would allow planes to travel on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
He emphasizes satellite technology in contrast to the old technology based on radar from the ground to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport was implemented and the overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and the parking and park-and-ride are not available on site.
The fears of transport strike raised the possibility that they may be forced to play the match behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A study, which was published recently in the journal Science, reported on the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species has evolved in just two generations, far sooner than previously thought necessary for such a process, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
The egg can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be hidden in tiny forms.
It can be bent into thin threads, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or engraved into leaves.
It can be very well melted and cast onto another metal. It can be done much less than cast, because it was used for decorating images that were hand-painted in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This here is called the pH of a chemical substance. It is possible to make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The gastric juice changes in color, depending on when it is acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical product.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix and knead a little then, with clean and wet hands, flatten it into a ball.
The humidity in the walls reacted with the external salts, which felt strange and formed a layer of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet outside, immediately in all the houses, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Traces of sewage networks have been found in the Minoan houses of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were public baths in ancient Egypt too, as well as in Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets also were part of public baths where men and women would stay together in mixed company.
When we call someone who is miles and miles away, you have to use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back immediately.
The satellite was being sent into space by a rocket. The scientists had to put telescopes into space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a very tall tower, more than 100 feet, to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The road has changed the world in an unbelievable way. The most important thing that the road has done for us is that it has provided us with much easier and faster transportation.
She brought the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below there are middle-sized felines that eat prey of medium size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are many small felines (including domestic cats) that eat very well many small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the niche concept, a special behavior that every feline assumes, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines, and they live in large groups, which are called prides.
The packs are made up of one to three large related males, together with thirty females and the young.
In common, the women are closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of hyenas behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and very deadly to their prey as well.
As a well-trained athlete, the tiger can jump (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and run five times the strength of a human being.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the gentle roar of the lion's voice, but more like a phrase of an angry and shouting hen.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are smaller than them, for sure.
The sciences hold that ocelots hunt and find prey (for food) through smell, by recognizing the terrain where they have been.
Frogs see very well at night with night vision, and they blend very well stealthily too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment and then pouncing onto their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they come (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or settle on a new island, in such a way that they cannot return back easily) they often find themselves in a different environment from the one they were in before.
This new environment here has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs major initial adjustments.
Over time, as the new population starts to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble more and more the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations would be so different that they could no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which refers simply to the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale as breath).
The plants produce their food from their own foot through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We make our homes with plants and we make clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, consequently it was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
And his long jaws were armed with more than 70 teeth aligned like razors, with one of the most in the mouth's entrance, as if to say there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We are not certain about this, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
He swallowed up everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex could have fought with him.
While most of their food seemed familiar, the Romans had their share of exotic or bizarre festive foods, such as boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich had the habit of using benches where they sat on one side while consuming their meals.
The meals of ancient Romans could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built in each of their places a principal temple, which was considered the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special tower structures in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not very important.
Most of an Italian Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women were making food in the courtyard; the shops had only some open doors that opened onto the street. The stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norwegian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red had been exiled from Iceland for murder and, when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, regardless of their discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were “Scandinavian,” there were indeed many differences among the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film “National Treasure” you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the “Declaration of Independence”.
Anyway, it is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
In the back of the “Declaration of Independence” were the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776”. The text is seen at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is said that at the beginning of its life the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was wrapped to be preserved.
Therefore, it is probable that the notation has been added just as a label.
The Normandy landings and the battles that followed had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had collaborated with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In the span of two or three weeks, the Americans and the French forces had liberated southern France and were ready to head towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, it has a society.
The word civility comes from the Latin "civilis", which means "civil", signifying "citizen", and "civitas", which means "city" or "city-state", and in some way defines the dimension of society.
The city-state is a precursor of nations. A culture of a civil type is brought close to the transmission of knowledge through different generations, a persistent cultural imprint and an equitable diffusion.
Primitive cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as old and true civilizations.
In the revolutionary war, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government – with the Congress as the only component – according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have any power to impose taxes, and since there was no executive or judiciary, it relied on the central authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
He did not even have the authority to annul the fiscal laws and tariffs between the states.
The Statute required the unanimous consent of all states before it could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, and car racing in F1.
Winter sports are most practiced in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and in the Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the biggest one is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as "Ilha Formosa," or "beautiful island."
From 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the indigenous practices of grain production, and employing Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugarcane plantations.
Since 1683 and perhaps since the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), control was taken over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and by 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three principal structures, known as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the adjacent constructions to the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues even today.
For example, the most common fixed-image film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
The vinegar is still produced in large quantities, but above all, its properties have been inherited from the forms of meaning of digital camera images.
The 35 mm format is actually a confusing title: 36 mm in width by 24 mm in height.
It is therefore said that the proportion of this form (when divided by twelve, to obtain the ratio of whole numbers or the simplest one) is 3:2.
Many common shapes (for example, the family of APS shapes) are paid or are very close to these proportions.
A frequent and exaggerated use of secondary variations is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
It states that the most effective position for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become much weaker and powerful, was put to the test.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has held European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His power, which pervaded everything or covered everyone, from the king to the ordinary person.
One of the first Christian principles is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and misery, and that the church's monetary funds are thus well-suited for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this principle was right.
Just after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy turned out to be effective, with strategic and vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violates internationally accepted law and is codified in various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain has mined the international waters to prevent access to certain areas of the ocean, causing a danger to neutral ships as well.
Since there had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the Twenties, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolationism.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of war in the First World War, nations decided to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss in the previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating periods of troubled times; each phase of China or every ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Between one dynasty and another, there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, there were many wars between various nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in China's ancient history, with thousands of people dying in battle to seize the highest seat of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are quite a lot of social and political effects, like the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Today the preview of the Revolution and occupation are open to all male candidates, thus allowing the ambitious and successful to move forward.
Maximum discourse for the military, because I intend to lower the ranks of the army in the classes, now lowering their importance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people oppressed by the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond this mundane life. He frequented a cave that became famous under the name "Hira," in the mountain of "Noor" (a place for contemplation).
The largest cave, surviving through the ages, exhibits a very vivid image of Mom's spiritual inclinations.
Perched on the top of a mountain to the north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy at all to find it, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
One can see nothing but the sky, beautiful and high above, and the many mountains below. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing.
Built from the beginning of the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), various smaller tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The uphill sign is a "V" and the downhill sign is a bracket, or a square without the bottom side.
"Sciù" means that you should start from the tip and untie the knot, and it signifies that you should start from the small handle (which is where your hand holds the handle) and untie the knot.
A high-pitched arch usually creates a softer sound, whereas a low-pitched arch is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your signs with the pencil, but remember that the printed staves are there for a musical reason, therefore they should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrorized, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two little children (eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and his sister, Madame Élisabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In a carriage they return to Paris surrounded by a mob of people shouting and hurling threats against the king and the queen.
A mob of people forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At a beautiful moment, one of this rabble brandishes the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles, before the terrified queen.
The expenses of the war of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the great Filipino people.
I was forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the expenses, and the interest on these bonds was issued in the name of the Philippine Government, through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Naturally, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the primary gain of Filipino imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a great many ideas, from techno-push or technological imperative in the narrow sense, to the notion that the destiny of humans is guided by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows its own course beyond cultural and political influence, and that the technology itself has “effects” in societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the use of cars necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Every morning, a national road network is not economically sustainable just for a few cars, and so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The large number of cars leads to a high incidence of accidents on the road, which causes the invention in health care of new surgical techniques to provide recovery to damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography has shaped individuals, and over time has influenced the customs and cultures linked to that geography, and those, being in harmony with the societal surroundings, were seen as better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame of being a center of luxury began shortly after 400 A.D. and endured for a short time until 1100 A.D.
The condition began to decline in the twelfth century, especially due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were considered more than those that the Byzantine merchants displayed.
It was during those times that the title of Capital of Fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the outfits were strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Besides, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the era, after the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses original local seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
The subcultures consisted of individuals who think in the most personal way, and who feel neglected by social standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive based on age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their developmental phase.
These children are called "feral" or "wild." Some feral children were raised by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the children was due to rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical impairment of the child.
The wild children may have suffered serious abuses or childhood traumas before being abandoned or running away.
Of others, it is thought that they have been more like beasts; it is said that some have lived alone in the wild.
When it comes entirely from non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the particular animal it grew up with, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
As project-based or duty-based learning makes it easier and more interesting to learn, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support that provides a foothold to people who are about to face a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher can be a form of scaffold, but so can the Microsoft Office paperclip assistant.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and have the purpose of discussing, suggesting, and explaining procedures that could be difficult for the student to manage alone.
The children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons that range from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We would consider that the foster system should be a consistent support area for these children.
Our foster care system was supposed to provide adequate housing, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare assistance.
The foster care had to provide everything necessary that was missing in the houses from which they had been taken previously.
The Internet combines mass elements like interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and access to benefits.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are proposed as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" are also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they were investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few seconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect if a person was about to lie by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article “The President’s Speech,” pointed out how people who are unable to understand a speech due to brain damage are still able to evaluate its sincerity.
It suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two bases of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation forward and backward between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate, with a digestive system like that of a human, to satisfy its amino acid needs from the plant resources available.
Furthermore, the impossibility of doing so has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were the proteins found in legume leaves, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not easily digested, but they provide a high amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our very own ancestors solved their "protein problem" a bit like savannah chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process when one wakes up spontaneously during the normal sleep period and falls back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done slowly by using a rather silent alarm to bring you back to awareness without waking you up abruptly.
If you find yourself having to turn off the alarm again while you're sleeping, it might be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to stop it.
Other basic options in the rhythm involve the consumption of plenty of fluids (mainly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleeping, which obviously forces one to go down to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The more the tension is low, the more the present vital force is positive. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can access enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our greatest tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been extended by the path of the Mahayana compassion and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everything.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the divinity Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to the collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the clashes of system, process, and culture led to the rift between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
He had served as a soldier for 40 years prior and had been seriously engaged in actual combat, by providing armies for hire, in the battlefields of Africa, Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Before September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these treaties became almost instantly obsolete when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army and the Soviet Union entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping and freight transport by sea are the most efficient means for moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of the navy is to ensure that your nation retains the capability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously interfering as much as possible with the enemy's ability to transport its people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Great Britain.
At the time, the German navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying hard to stop this traffic.
If the wings had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about ten thousand years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes begin to maintain them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often tended by goatherds who were more or less young, similar to the shepherd we know. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
The wagons were built in England already in the 16th century.
They wrote that the carriages were simply made of parallel wooden axles, allowing the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and to carry heavier loads compared to the slightly rougher roads of those times.
The traverses were introduced rather quickly to maintain and hold them in position. Anyway, it was clear in the morning that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had a point of leverage on the upper side.
This here is becoming a common practice, but doing it required much more usage of loads of carts.
In the end, the wooden rails were replaced by iron. Since 1767, the first all-iron ones were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, and human beings began to walk upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, usually did not walk upright.
The bipedal specialization is found in the fossils of Australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally respectful way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also be activists, to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This here, many times, is just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we should find the roots of the problems and deactivate them.
It is indeed clear that the world has changed significantly thanks to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and that problems have become many more due to overpopulation and the erratic lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress, on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the president of Congress John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was sent a short distance away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known in the trade as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on the 8th of July.
A document was sent to George Washington on the 6th of July, which he read to his troops in New York on the 9th of July. A copy arrived in London on the 10th of August.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten copy has not survived.
Several paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They call them birds.
Several people will not know dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.
But there are several things in birds that still seem like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Practically all modern computers today rely on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are indicated as binary digits – or bits, for use in computer language.
Internal poisoning or poisoning may not be immediately evident. The symptoms, like vomiting, are often so general that they make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of drugs or household chemical products.
Check the leaflet for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term scimixa is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of creatures.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are animals strongly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bedbugs and biting midges are creatures that live in nests, and are capable of living within the nest or in the host's house.
In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a condition that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women have twice the probability of having MS compared to men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their son, to raise a child.
This couple can choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can assume the role of parents to the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand how the world functions through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific research.
It is not just, however, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more hypotheses, pose questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
The opinions of Aristotle were accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
With the diminishing knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological pathways.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, and both plants and animals.
Biological oscillators are self-sufficient oscillators that continue a cyclic period of free running, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments by marking the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material of the affected piece, and if the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is the attraction of people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, or birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information within the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and knowing orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small cities by car to go to their workplace, and they are overtaken by others, for whom the work destination is the place that the former have just left.
In this concept of dynamic transportation, everyone is in some way connected and supports a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and must use the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developing countries, there is a risk of environmental impacts on water quality or bridge safety.
Why do the transportation systems create these troubles, why do they fail every day? Are the transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental about to happen?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement between two interconnected bridges and vehicles, and the interactions they create among themselves.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to have behaviors within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can, roughly speaking, be mathematically represented.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to planning, designing, and managing roads.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly has helped them escape predators more swiftly and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being small in size. This gives them a broader range of tiny places to hide from predators.
This one gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today the only insects that cannot receive air are Mayflies and Ephemeroptera.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarco said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought that he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and also the other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth is not perceived as if it were about to mix, is it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, sometimes as wide as six miles.
A good 20 percent of the planet's fresh water is carried by rivers into the oceans or comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River begins and is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
It is known that the construction of the stone pyramids dates back to before the end of the Old Kingdom, and the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient inhabitants of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the State, so much so that Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
People knew the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, or copper, because these could all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to work with using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This here was most similar to the four states of matter (in descending order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, knowing that it also hypothesized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are quite a few elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are never so small that billions of them could fit inside the period of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil has been a good friend to many people since it came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a diminished status and limited uses.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil.
One can only wonder what would go through one's mind when something new arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the principle that requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like having to push a heavy cart up a little hill. By splitting the nucleus again, therefore, some of that energy is released.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70km thick on its near side and 100km on its far side.
There are more nuances under the seas and more shadows under the skies.
The sand settled more in that side nearby because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the seawater and foam to rise to the surface.
The theories of behavior focus on the research of what makes people behave in a certain way, or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or decisions that have been internalized in ways that remain through adulthood.
These theories relate to what certain people have seen, which make them decide the things they do and what things they will or will not do in their environment.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In the air, two behaviors emerge when managers start to lead their old colleagues. At one end of the spectrum, there is trying to stay "one of the guys" (or of the girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, executing disciplinary actions, evaluating performances, assigning responsibilities, and retaining and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has done, and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often translates into splits between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the highest standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the virtual team act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy at the level of conventional team members because their teams can meet based on variable hourly flows that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership group to which all the members refer. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to face the long process of forming an organization that learns? One objective for putting into practice the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization that works together to overcome a hurdle or to bring about a new innovative process to satisfy the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to adjust and organize organizations at a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide evidence for a theoretical method of cognitive investigation. Therefore, they narrow the area of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior challenges science in its research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, or tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This one provides a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves the construction of machines to automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on solving real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is often used in sectors such as the economy, medicine, engineering, and the military because it has been integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of these classes. Quite often a teacher would like to take their students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with trips in the virtual field. Students can examine objects from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while seated with their class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook of memories.
Blogs can help improve students' writing. Since students often begin their experience on blogs with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience changes things.
Since the students are often the most public or most critical, the blog writer begins to strive to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
Even the blog "forces students to become experts of the world that surrounds them". The necessity to feed the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages extending learning far beyond traditional school hours.
The appropriate use of blogs "can allow students to become more analytical and critical; through an active response to materials on the internet, students can define their positions in the context of writings by others and outline their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, and it features a series of art galleries and museums that display Canada's past and present.
Further south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north it hosts the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
All these things and others still highlight Ontario as what is typically considered Canadian by outsiders.
The large areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and some are wild and almost uninhabited.
From a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the biggest and most beautiful, and a continent of its own when it comes to wild fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France and known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it has had great success in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and European colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama found the route from the Cape of Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended to all women that they always declare themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is useful to bring along a ring (just one that is not too expensive).
Women had to realize that cultural differences could result in something they might consider as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You must stop refusing men and not have any desire to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it's not good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt cities like Dar al-Bayda and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Down in the old town, it's easy to find places that sell traditional products like carpets, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the westernmost part of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, visits to the Goma lava field may serve to understand the state of conflict that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as one of the best trails in Africa for gorilla sightings.
To get around in Goma, one can use boda-boda (or motorcycle taxis). The usual price for a short trip is 500 Congolese francs more or less.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city even if its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
Since 1990, it has been added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert encroachment.
It was one of the main stages in the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has more of an Arab atmosphere than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, so much so that the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and has been considered a jewel of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily costs for conservation and entrance to the park.
It can also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main destination.
The line of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a bar code brilliantly reflected by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To obtain the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and then head towards the Kowloon promenade.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is densely populated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers have taken as their own and therefore if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just swamps of mangroves: they include some of the last remaining remnants of lush jungle that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now in the area 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day long, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interdistrict buses are often full, it is recommended to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese-built buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means for reaching nearby places, like Paro (Nu150) and Punakha (Nu200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and it has two lanes that are 3.50m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is expected for September 2017, when it is anticipated that Brazilian customs inspections will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group among those who lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as Guayacurù and Payaguá, who survived by hunting and fishing.
From the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "the giant province of the Indies," was born from the encounter of Spanish conquerors with original indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted about three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and among the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
The tournaments and the lesser-known matches might also be seen during other times of the year.
For details on the tournaments and where to purchase polo match tickets, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at par to the British pound.
The money can be exchanged in the only bank located in Stanley, next to the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
In those peripheral areas, credit cards were not accepted, even though British and American banknotes might be required; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to change the value of the Falklands to that of an island currency, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when in the northern hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, in the summer months with temperatures typically around 30 degrees.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of water remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the authorities of the park, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
It does not matter how many prey they might find: the bison, the bears, the deer, the boars and almost all the large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the proper distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Moreover, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or preparing food that creates odors and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850 and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.

All the ships were sunk, except for one British aircraft carrier. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the supreme leader Tupua Tamanese Lealofi III.
There are many ways, due to the fact that Auckland is divided between two ports. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and go from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
I'm exhausted with all my pine needles covered in fresh snow, and more of them have shade provided by pohutukawa leaves.
The slopes of Tamaki Drive are at Waitemata Harbour, in the inner surroundings of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These here are some of the main squares of the city, full of people with a beautiful row of shops lined up in the square. The water is dark.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are so many French wines to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you prefer.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee was foreign. A short black is an "espresso", a cappuccino comes without froth, and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on par with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but very good.
Many trips to the coral reef are made all year long, and the injuries due to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Nevertheless, pay attention to the advice of the authorities, obey all the signals and pay attention very carefully to the following warnings.
The jellyfish are found near the beaches and near the river mouths from October to around November of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of these periods.
Sharks exist, but it's rare that they attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking the trip in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of having a place to sleep, once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, although you may find the possibility of booking other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, thanks to a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, the organization of transportation to/from the airport, or also combined flight/hotel packages.
You can also keep a reservation on hold if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., the visa).
Any changes or questions should be examined in advance through the travel agent, and not directly with the hotel.
For certain festivals, the vast majority of festival participants decide to camp on site, and most people consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you must arrive early to find a spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music in the main parks could be finished, it could be some sections of the festival that continue to play late into the night.
Certain festivals are held in special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin position, because crossing the ice causes a horrible squeaking noise for those who are most affected.
The cruises in Saint Petersburg include time in the city. The cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Signs and directions are absent and exits can be difficult to find.
Usually, they have special offers of food, drinks, and other things to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Certain places offer alcoholic beverages inside the premises. However, intoxication compromises judgment, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Whoever travels or drives at certain latitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on dry asphalt.
In snowstorm seasons, even falling a little in a short time is enough snow to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by fog or snow blowing or by condensation or frost on vehicle windows.
Besides, the road conditions of ice and snow are normal in many countries, and the traffic continues as usual without interruptions all year round.
