This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils mostly cannot provide, such as color and a three-dimensional appearance.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown at the top, and pale or carotenoid in color on the underside.
The finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other feather characteristics—soft filaments and soft barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development from these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but for thermoregulation or display. The researchers indicated that, although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not those like on a chick.

They have determined that the Sun operates based on the same fundamental principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system has been found to be driven by their brightness (luminosity), rotation, and nothing more.
Brightness (luminosity) and rotation are used together to determine the star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic pole inversion.

The deceased were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cudeback, 21 years old. Cudeback was the driver.
Edgar Vegilja sustained injuries to his hand and jaw, while Christopher Schneider required reconstructive surgery on his face.
Juka's weapon failed while it was aimed at the fifth man's head. Schneider has constant pain, blindness in one eye, a missing part of the skull, and a titanium facial reconstruction.
Schneider testified via video link from an AWV base in his homeland.
Besides the event on Wednesday, Karpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
First, there was the Slalom, where she did not finish the first race. 36 out of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her next race, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loech and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Jingni Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's sitting group did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not qualify for the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found and returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy General Inspector D K Arya said, "We arrested five individuals who raped a woman from Switzerland and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kandar, Buta Kandar, Rampro Kandar, Gaza Kandar, and Vishnu Kandar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused came to court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the traffic accident occurred was temporarily closed until the emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja has since appeared at the Edinburgh High Court accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be called into question since her picture has been published everywhere.
This is common everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judicial system is different and the courts consider the publication of images as potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "it really seems like journalists are walking a fine line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Office of the Public Prosecutor, which has full jurisdiction over the prosecution, indicated to journalists that no additional comments will be given at least until the indictment.
According to the source, the document relates to the border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to be reverted to the pre-1967 Middle East war period.
As other topics, supposedly, are the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy place for both peoples, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel seeks a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of 10 years after an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow that presence only for a period of five years.
In the additional trial for pest control, the shooters were supposed to be under strict supervision by the rangers, as the trial was being observed and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
According to the hunting program of the Association of Sporting Hunters, in cooperation with NPWS and the Australian Association of Sporting Hunters (NJV), qualified volunteers have been enlisted.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Parks and Wildlife Conservation at NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday for a new nine-member Interim Election Commission (SEC).
This is the fifth Interim Election Commission of Marteli in 4 years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed that the CEO resign in advance as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
With the commission, Martelli actually reacted to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes the violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, and some date back even to 2011.
Around 60 cases of defective iPod devices overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires, and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that they are aware of 27 unfortunate incidents related to the devices.
Last week, META announced that they received a notification from Apple regarding 34 more cases of overheating, which the company considers "insignificant."
In its response, the Ministry called the delay of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Marijana at 07:19 a.m. (09:19 a.m. GMT on Friday).
Representatives of the Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, which is the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers replaced the place with an older woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
She studied to be a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research preterm birth in his free time.
His research has shown that if a hormone is administered, the maturation of the baby's fetal lungs would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was an outcast like me ... maybe even more ... I love her and will miss her ... I hope she is in a better place."
Out of 1,400 people who were surveyed before the federal elections in 2010, the number of those who are against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this opinion, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the extremes noted in the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there is doubt about his physical readiness.
He could not take the medicines he needed to overcome the pain because they are banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number at the time on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source for spreading water on Earth, in addition to the organic matter that could have created proteins and supported life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, specifically, how Earth was created, because a long time ago comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, began his tenure as governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed the bill permitting same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel every year and reducing carbon emissions.
He uses technology that is based on satellites, as opposed to the old technology which is based on ground radar, to help air traffic controllers determine the aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport has been organized, and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley, with parking spaces and park-and-ride facilities not available at the stadium.
The fear of lack of transport increased the possibility of the match being held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species have evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process took much longer, due to the interbreeding between the endemic Galápagos finches, Geospiza fortis and the large cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any shapes. It can be bent into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be bent and intertwined. It can be hammered or stretched into layers.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade pictures in books called "Illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the chemical pH value. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture of your hands will react with the outer layers, which you will feel unusually and will form a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses in the cities from the Minoan era on Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
Toilets existed in the ancient states of Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, in some situations, toilets were part of the public baths where both men and women went together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back almost at the same moment.
They sent the satellite into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to take a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The best thing the wheel has done for us is that it has enabled easier and faster transportation.
It made possible the train, the automobile, and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats which eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are many small cats (including pet cats that roam freely) that eat the much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of domain, a special trait that each cat has that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called prides.
The herd consists of one to three blood-related males, along with up to thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely bonded with each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly for their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of the strongest human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a sentence of words that resemble 'howling and loud shouting.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
They see well in the dark with night vision and move stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into the environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river or relocates to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in an environment different from the one it was in previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what it needed before.
The initial population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment and starts to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (or release).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our homes are made from plants, and our clothes are made from plants too. Plants make up a large part of the food we eat. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, and feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with another row in the upper part of the mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that stood in his way.
We don't know for sure, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is even possible that it was a cannibal.
He attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus rex was no match for him.
Although most of the food is familiar to us, the Romans also had their own strange or unusual feasts, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that although poor people and women ate their food seated on stools, wealthy people preferred to have communal feasts, where they would recline while eating their meals.
The dishes of Ancient Rome certainly did not contain products that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of the gods, which was considered the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to serve the needs of the gods through rituals and celebrations.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special elevations in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The summit of the elevation represented a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate conditions of the Middle East, houses were not that important.
Most of the life of the ancient Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were just open stalls facing the street. The stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no dense forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland because of murder, so when he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Despite each of the countries being "Scandinavian," there were a multitude of differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might believe that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there is a map of hidden treasure.
However, this is not true. Despite there being something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" are written. The text is upside down and located at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part had not yet been liberated.
He was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies entered southern France, and the invasion was called Operation "Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated Southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization represents a particular culture formed by a significant large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "civil," related to the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," which somewhat defines the scope of society.
City-states are the harbingers of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a long-lasting cultural imprint, and quite extensive dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—where the only component was Congress—according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, since there were no national executive or judicial bodies, it relied on state authorities, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
Also, it did not have the authority to reject the laws on taxes and customs between the states.
The members required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states regarded the central government so unseriously that their representatives were often absent.
Italian national football, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, it is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in local grain processing habits and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took over the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is comprised of three main structures, namely the "Intihuatana," the "Temple of the Sun," and the "Room of the Three Windows."
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been renovated to give tourists an impression of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photo format in the world is 35 mm, which was the size of film that prevailed at the end of the analog film era.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly, its ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of a digital camera.
The 35 mm format is actually quite confusing, 36 mm in width by 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (which is divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format group) are equal to or significantly approximate the ratio.
The most abused and most frequently mocked rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamics while maintaining order in the picture.
It highlights that the most effective way is to position the main subject at the intersection of the lines that divide the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Roman Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subjected to criticism.
Despite the differences in languages and customs, the Christian religion united the European countries for over a thousand years.
Her comprehensive power influenced everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are intended solely for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the principles are being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostile relations, Britain initiated the naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, disrupting the essential supply to the military and civilians, although the blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, thereby posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there were not many opportunities to respond to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitudes of pacifism and isolation prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After the military horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to start working at the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a collection of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these phases was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, there were fierce battles among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, when thousands of people died in the struggle to sit at the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to all people, and not just to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, job positions were opened for all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same applies to the military because, instead of the military ranking being based on class, it was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this earthly life. He often went to a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) to contemplate.
he secluded himself in a cave, which has survived through time, providing a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Situated on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it is not at all easy to find even if someone knew it existed. Once you enter the cave, it is complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the multitude of surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
Of the Seven Wonders, today only the Great Pyramid of Giza still exists.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of numerous large pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau" or "The Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of Death, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign "upper arc" looks like the letter V, and the sign "lower arc" like a connector or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means that you should start at the top and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward movement with the bow produces a softer sound, while the downward movement results in a stronger and more aggressive sound.
Feel free to write your own symbols, but remember, the printed notes are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris from Versailles by a group of market women on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by crowds of people who were screaming and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a man from the crowd was waving with the head of the royal guard killed in Versailles before the terrified queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover the majority of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profit obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos constituted a fundamental benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when the events occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, in the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to a strong sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology, in itself, follows a path that largely surpasses cultural or political influence and that technology, on the other hand, has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a network of roads at the national level is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being worked on to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increased frequency of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for treating injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, adopted by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to geography emerged, so in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status deteriorated during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets had to offer.
During this period, the title of the Fashion Capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style culminated between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western fashion was known to lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existential agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds originating from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
In the past, most farmers engaged in agriculture for their own needs, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may vary as a result of age, ethnic group, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style that encompasses fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to recall the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, poverty, or intentional abuse by adults, remained unsocialized while growing up.
Such children are referred to as "feral" or wild. Some feral children were confined by people (usually by their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
The rough children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are reportedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When fully grown by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to ease learning and make it more interesting, the technique called "scaffolding" takes it a step further.
The technique called "scaffolding" is not a learning method but a support tool that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended for questioning, prompting, and explaining procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to master on their own.
The children are placed in a home for children without parents or foster families for reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet they still do.
We consider that the Foster Care System is a safe zone for these children.
Our caregiving system should provide secure homes, caring guardians, stable education, and a reliable healthcare system.
The care should provide all the needs that have been lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet contains elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to pleasures.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Both Amy and McCord (1998) identify "personal participation" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects, examining audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it might be possible to detect if someone is lying through accurate interpretation of micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book "The President's Speech," mentioned how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain injury are still capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
The twentieth-century research proved that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection allows for the removal of expressed variations from the group.
Segregation and recombination shift the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
Furthermore, if it does not succeed, there will be serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Considering all circumstances, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in almost the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep and falling back to sleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm to wake you without fully waking you up.
If you accidentally turn off the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
The other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before sleep, which causes a person to have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the pressure, the more positive the present life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only things that obstruct our path to the goal are the pressure and negativity from within us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, which were expanded with the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is "divine yoga." Through the visualization of several deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness for enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, differences in systems, processes, and culture led to disagreements between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and be a real struggle, with proxy armies, on military fronts from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense force had already been defeated and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize alongside the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after the invasion of the eastern parts of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The transportation of goods by ships is definitely the most efficient way to transfer a large number of people and goods across the ocean.
The traditional role of navies is to ensure that your country maintains the capability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time making it difficult for the enemy to transport their people and goods.
One of the most important examples of this recently was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop such traffic.
If the allies suffered a defeat, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain just as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so they could easily obtain milk, fur, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed over hills or pastures, tended by goat herders who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These farming methods are still used today.
Horse-drawn trams were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons were mainly constructed from parallel wooden planks, they could be pulled by horses for greater speed and for carrying a heavier load than what was carried on the poor roads of that time.
Railway sleepers were used from the beginning to hold the rails in place. However, it gradually became established that the rails would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on the top part.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first train with completely iron wheels was launched.
The first known means of transportation was walking; people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, were not in the habit of walking upright as often.
Bipedal adaptations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start behaving more friendly towards the environment, join the ecological movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment. However, if only a temporary solution is not sought, then the root of the problems should be uncovered and thus eradicated.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancement of mankind, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress, on July 4, the draft manuscript, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few streets down to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and it was read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy also arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap documents that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are called birds.
Many do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But, there are many things about birds that continue to make them resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and move on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or, when using computer jargon, they are called bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general, so a diagnosis cannot be immediately made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open box of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense.
This term originates from the ancient similarity with bedbugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both bedbugs and parasites are nidicolous, adapted to living in a nest or residing on their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
The couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can have parental rights over the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is conducted following this method.
But still, it is not only that, but also experimentation, and an experiment is a trial used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, as well as observation, also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, with a particular emphasis on the Latin Bible.
The views of Aristotle on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the West remained cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
A multitude of observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often significantly depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their creation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of free-running cyclical movement even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutated genetic cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutated cells in any other location can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural regions to enjoy the landscape, including the plant and animal life.
Location activity examples include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns with their cars to go to work and pass by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shared transportation, everyone is somehow connected and supports the transportation system based on private cars.
Science now points out that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability, which has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, such significant complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they disappoint daily? Are transport engineers simply not competent? Or is something more important happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers know how to stick to a reasonably consistent framework; thus, traffic flows tend to have a certain reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relations assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with some places being as wide as six miles.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which by then were already more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The legislation and official communication of the Vatican are in the Italian language.
The people who work in the state use the Italian language daily, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
It is something like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also believed that they transform into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are actually a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table consists of many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There can also be alloys that include small amounts of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status and usage of the pencil have decreased.
People now write messages on a computer and never have to approach a pencil sharpener again.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is needed to create a nucleus from a multitude of protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Then, with the repeated division of the core, part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with or without a little push.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the "crust."
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas, and thicker under the plateaus.
There may be more basalt plains on the near side because the crust is thinner. This makes it easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what excites people or what they like.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as they mature from children to adults.
These theories examine what makes some people like the things they do and which things in their environment will motivate them to do or not do certain things.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior may emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. On one hand, there is an attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable for their actions.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable figure who thinks he or she must change everything the team has done and make it his or her own.
However, the leader has ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often results in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams operate according to the same standards of excellence as standard teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more independence than members of a conventional team because their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which might not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an exceptional component of a virtual team.
The management team is the "invisible team" to which each of the members answers. It is precisely the visible team that sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity thrive.
As a result, the organization's collaborative process to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process for serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to research on cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientific research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This is how a wealth of information and materials is provided for creating simulation models that will help us in understanding the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation of science fiction, artificial intelligence represents a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research on artificial intelligence involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to users' diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
Such matters have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
After being integrated into several software applications for home computers and video games, the AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field practicums are a big part of every classroom. Very often, the teacher would like to take her students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual excursions. Students can explore museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in class.
And the virtual sharing tour is a good way to reminisce about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital. Each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to become more skilled regarding the world around them." The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can encourage students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to material online, students can define their positions in the context of the written texts of others, as well as highlight their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, characterized by a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, while the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and much more make Ontario perfectly Canadian, as foreigners see it.
The large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in itself, a continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it quickly spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their true marital status.
It helps to wear a ring (just not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stick to your position (with or without cultural differences, that does not mean it is okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and built it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan restored the city as Daru I-Badja, but it was given the name Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established trading posts here.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine pots, clay dishes, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of cheap decorations, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the remotest eastern parts near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, any visit outside of Goma should be checked to find out the state of unrest that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although the city is a tourist attraction and has an airport, today Timbuktu is an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
He was one of the main stops during the special PBS program, "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is a stark contrast to the other cities in the country, as it has more Arab charm than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of the Republic of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with a distinct wildlife.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and is considered a flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation fees and park entrance tickets.
It might also be useful for a person to buy a "Wild Card" which allows entry to any park in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong originates from Hong Kong Island, and it is the place that is the main focus of many tourists.
The arrangement of the buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is compared to a dazzling chart highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view in Hong Kong, leave the island and head opposite the Kowloon waterfront.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
That is the place that the British colonizers occupied, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, it is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the longest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast, in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just marshlands with mangroves - they encompass some of the last remaining strongholds of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one third is covered with water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that today around 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer live in this area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
In most areas, small Japanese minibuses are used, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Taxi sharing is a quick and efficient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two paths each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The plan is for the bridge to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "The Great Province of Southeast Asia," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization which lasted for more than three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here in other parts of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
The money is exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, directly opposite the "FIC West" shop.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands and within the Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although it might be possible to pay with British and American currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable for you.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is located south of the Equator, so it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; in the summer months, temperatures above +30 degrees Celsius are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and moisture together make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" periods: the amount of rainfall remains relatively consistent throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, they are still wild animals, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park services' guidelines, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they seem, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals could attack.
Every year, a dozen visitors get injured because they do not maintain proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food with strong odors and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has officially been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the infamous naval standoff occurred at the harbor when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank, except for one British warship. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, the peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland spans two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the northern shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches safe for swimming, and most have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most famous local beer is called "Nambur One," which is not heavy, but a pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that can be taken, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia may travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water can easily be found if you are cautious.
The idea of "plain white" coffee is not familiar to the residents of Australia. A short black coffee is "espresso," a cappuccino comes with lots of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards. Although expensive, the fruit juices are excellent.
Trips to the reef are common throughout the year, and it is rare for injuries to the reef to occur for these reasons.
However, heed the advice from the authorities, respect all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appears along the beaches and river mouths, from October to April, north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be found outside of this time period.
Sharks do indeed exist, but, however, they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and simply swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live constantly in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries, north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveler can be at ease knowing that they will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Tourist agents usually have agreements with certain hotels, although you can also book accommodation elsewhere, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer, or even combined packages with flight and hotel.
They may also keep your reservation if you need some time to consider the offer or to secure other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
All modifications and requests should be checked first with the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close as possible to the center of the events, you will need to enter early and grab a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, there are parts of the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping zones for families with small children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin because passing through ice creates a dreadful sound for the most vulnerable.
The cruises in Saint Petersburg also include passage through the city. The cruise travelers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually put in a lot of effort to maximize the time and money guests spend. Typically, there are no windows and clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests' spirits up and encourage them to stay.
Some places offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is low and one cannot drive as on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or freezing on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic flows almost smoothly throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The popular sense of the term safari refers to an overland journey to observe the magnificent African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles more closely, so the standard equipment also provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
"Walking safaris (also called ""wilderness walks"", ""hiking safaris"", or ""going on foot"") consist of walking, either for a few hours or for several days."
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
There are differences in cancellation policies, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies caused by the coronavirus were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry out. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the material become too hot (which can lead to shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
Although there are different methods of water purification, some of them are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough for the water to boil for one minute, while in others, a few minutes are necessary.
Filters differ in efficiency, which you should care about, and you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that are not present in the regions they come from.
Parasites can spoil food, cause inflammation, or in more serious cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force, are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempted from paying taxes and excises at certain locations.
Passengers travelling to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch from Point Marion to Fairmont offers the most exhilarating driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, passing through isolated forest areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be cautious: large slopes, a narrow road, and sharp curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the preceding and subsequent sections, typically 35-40 mi/h (56-64 km/h), so strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
However, surprisingly, the mobile signal is much stronger here than in other areas, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and diverse, similar to those of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are usually made, with apples in dough throughout the entire year, and in the summer they can be found with cherries and plums.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes pair excellently with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich sweets, try these which, depending on the region, are called berliner, pfannkuchen, or krapfen.
Curry is a dish with herbs and spices, containing meat or vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "watery," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the continental areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used to prepare curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
The term Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the nation of 17,000 islands.
However, if used without additional attributes, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available across the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a selection of simply spiced meals, with the most dominant flavors of Javanese cuisine being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are support for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but there may also be safety concerns due to the likelihood of their feet getting stuck in them.
If a horse throws off the rider, but their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, and the horse runs away, it is possible for the horse to drag the rider. To minimize the risk, a large number of precautionary measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear boots with a heel and a smooth, very tight sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if pulled by the rider in a fall.
The Cochamó Valley - The main destination for hiking in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cracks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly creating new routes through the endless potential of the mountain's slopes.
Winter alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you glide over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
"Skiing is a main activity during travel for many enthusiasts, often known as 'ski bums,' whose entire vacation revolves around skiing at a specific location."
The concept of skiing is very old - there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BCE!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpack ski traveling: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related, but does not always include alpine skiing or mountaineering, which are performed on steep terrain and require much sturdier skis and boots.
Look at the ski trail as a similar path for hiking.
Under good conditions, you could cover greater distances than by walking - but you would very rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across multiple countries would mean multiple applications for visas and passport control.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a single state in this regard.
As long as you are in this zone, in principle, you can cross borders without constantly going through passport control points.
Similarly, by holding a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country separately, thereby saving time, money, and documentation.
There is no universal definition by which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as items that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographic location, with the age limit possibly being shorter in North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiquities, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is the most important means of subsistence among the Lapps, and the culture associated with trade is also important for many other professions.
But even traditionally, not all the Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, while reindeer were usually used as working animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is a significant income in Sapmi, in the Sami area.
Although it is widely used, especially among those who are not Roma, the word "Gypsy" is generally considered offensive because it evokes negative stereotypes and a mistaken perception of the Romani people.
If travel warnings are given for the country you want to visit, it may have consequences for your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may want to seek advice from other governments as well, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are just a brief overview of the political situation in a given country.
The presented views are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic name for any bad weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social unrest, and loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are various types that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather conditions include snowfall, snowstorm, black ice, and strong winds with dust.
Passengers are advised to be aware of the risk of adverse weather conditions that may affect the area in which they are located, as this may impact their plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Searching the internet under 'Hostile Environment Course' will likely provide you with an address from a local company.
The course covers all the issues discussed here in detail, usually through practical experience.
The course will typically last from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes, weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are often encountered, but editions on coping in war are very rare.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated with the desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to authenticate these documents is equally variable.
Security checkpoint screenings became much more intrusive in the period following September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without having their privacy and dignity compromised.
The backwash is the return flow of the waves that break on the beach, usually from a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow gathers in the deeper parts, and here a fast deep water current can form.
Most fatalities occur as a result of fatigue while trying to swim against the current, which might be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won’t get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you are noticed, you may want to wait for a rescue service.
The shock upon returning occurs earlier than culture shock (has a shorter period of bliss), lasts longer, and can be more difficult.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes particularly have trouble readjusting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to the new culture and have forgotten some habits from your home culture.
When you go abroad for the first time, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to the new country.
Many people would not assume that patience and understanding are also required for travelers returning home.
The show with sounds and lighting of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
The pyramids can be seen even in the dark, and you can watch them in silence before the start of the performance.
Usually, the sound of tourists and vendors is constantly heard. The story of sound and light is like something out of a picture book.
The Sphinx is set as a background and narrator of an endless story.
The pyramids are displaying footage, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several nations and have the most bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
The rest include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of the active volcano creates a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, which borders on the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here join into a plateau and then rise again to form a range of the Ellsworth Mountains with a length of 360 km, cut through by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are located the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson's highest peak at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a mobile network, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A regular satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone because to make a call, you must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by ships, both for goods and yachts, as well as by expeditions that require data and voice messages over long distances.
The local telephone operator should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling with learning is becoming a much more popular option for those who plan to take a break from schooling.
This is particularly popular among graduates, giving them a chance to take a gap year before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in an overseas course during your gap year can enhance your chances of getting into college when you return to your home country.
Usually, there will be a tuition fee for enrolling in such educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," there are also thousands of islands both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't have to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, with smaller boats or even kayaks, a completely different experience is encountered.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, and every seventh or eighth person owns a boat.
Something similar can be found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is very unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
Most cruises on the impressive Baltic Sea include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days while returning to the ship for sleeping at night.
If you go to the coast with excursion boats, you will not need a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruises in the brochures include Berlin in Germany. As you can see above on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea, so the visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and categories, especially if they have not flown before, or if they have had a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: it is no different from personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, understanding one of the ways airplanes operate and what happens during the flight can help them overcome the fear based on the unknown or the loss of control.
Courier services are well-paid for the fast delivery of packages. Time is often very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
For some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem for other routes and smaller firms.
If they ship packages by air transport, on some routes it takes days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to transfer them faster was to send them as checked luggage. Aviation regulations will not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger. This is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel in first or business class is to pay a hefty stack of money for that privilege (or even better, let your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as much as it is considered a rule, expect to pay four times more than the economy class price for business class, and eleven times more expensive for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in asking for a discount for a place in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a large amount of dollars for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital city of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but the Russian language is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict spurred the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the unsuccessful political negotiations, economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Please regard the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the place by marking or scratching graffiti on the buildings.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows the Spanish language.
However, most signs are written only in Catalan because legally it is the first official language.
However, the Spanish language is widely used in public transportation and other institutions.
Standard announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, while unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a large number of languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, unfriendly, and arrogant.
While often this is an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to enjoy yourself in Paris is to be as polite as possible, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will greatly ease your stay.
The rough exterior of Parisians quickly disappears if you show a little basic kindness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is abundant with forested areas, mainly of beech, spruce, and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There are significantly many variations of plant communities due to the different microclimate, diverse soil, and varying altitude.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal species and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the peacock can be found there, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders should also be covered.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you will elicit a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In a similar way, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
And this can be borrowed from what is available at the entrance, but that clothing is not washed after each person who wears it, so it might be uncomfortable for you to wear those skirts. For men, there is a universal size!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and everything contains olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato, and various toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie for You, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

However, people who know a little Spanish might come to a hasty conclusion that the Portuguese language is close enough, so it does not need to be studied separately.
Observatories built before the modern era are usually outdated today and continue to be used as museums or educational sites.
Since when they were most popular, light pollution was not a problem for them like it is today, they are usually found in cities or at boarding schools and are more easily accessible than those built nowadays.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas with desirable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China where the plum blossom is the most desired flower.
In Japan, the first parties under the blossoming cherry trees were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and the members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in their natural environment. Therefore, resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "samples" may get you kicked out without discussion.
Generally speaking, Singapore is an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to get around in, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But, considering that it is located in the "most tropical place" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (less frequently when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the place where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.

Of course, there are Christian theological interpretations of this tradition, but it is also possible that it is a pre-Christian ritual for spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the gathering transitioning into a celebration at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus.
All the animals that initially came to the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to travel, making the Galapagos a primary pasture for the giant tortoise.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos, many mammals have been brought in, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
The polar night can be experienced if you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, which actually means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis since the sky will be dark almost all day long.
