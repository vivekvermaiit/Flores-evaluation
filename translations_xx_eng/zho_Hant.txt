This not only proves a widely circulated theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides details that most fossils cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional composition.
Scientists say the outer layer of the animal's feathers is chestnut brown, while the inner layer is either an off-white color or carrot color.
The discovery also provides profound insights into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs lacked fully developed shafts, known as rachis, but other feather characteristics, namely barbs and barbules, did exist, researchers have inferred that these other characteristics likely evolved into rachis later on.
The structure of these feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers stated that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen indicates that it is mature feathers rather than chick down.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathers in the sample are fully developed, rather than the newborn hair of a young animal.
A car bomb explosion at the Gaziantep Police Headquarters in Turkey yesterday morning resulted in the deaths of two police officers and injured more than twenty civilians.
The governor's office stated that nineteen of the injured are police officers.

They found that the operation of the Sun is based on the same principles as other stars: the activities of all stars in the system are driven by their luminosity and rotation, it's that simple.
The Rossby number of a star is related to the flow of plasma and must be determined by luminosity and rotation.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the celestial body is in terms of magnetic field reversal.

The website serves millions of publicly licensed media, and dissatisfaction within the community has prompted the relevant authorities to currently draft a policy regarding sexual content for the website.
The current research is primarily theoretical, but the goal of this project is to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team wants to observe is the result of tidal interactions between the dark matter of this galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the moon's gravity causes tides on Earth, the Milky Way exerts forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can ascertain that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
The theory asserts that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy forms a halo and is composed of many particles.

In France, voting traditionally is a low-tech experience: the voter is alone in the voting booth, placing a pre-printed ballot indicating their choice into an envelope.
After the voter‚Äôs identity is verified by an official, the voter then places the envelope in the ballot box and signs on the ballot paper.
The French electoral law meticulously codifies the voting procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside the box at the start of voting, and that no envelopes other than those authorized and genuinely counted as submitted by voters are added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes by following specific procedures under strict supervision.

The deceased were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was the bus driver.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstructive surgery.
When Uka aimed at the head of the fifth person, the gun malfunctioned. The injuries caused Schneider long-lasting pain, blindness in one eye, skull defects, and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video at a United States Air Force Base in his hometown.
In addition to Wednesday's match, Carpanedo also participated in two individual events in the tournament.
Her first race was the slalom, and the first round ended in a DNF (Did Not Finish). Among the 116 competitors in that race, 36 achieved the same result.
Her other competition was the giant slalom, where she ranked 10th in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4 minutes 41.30 seconds. She was 2 minutes 11.60 seconds slower than the Austrian athlete Claudia Loesch, who ranked first, and 1 minute 09.02 seconds slower than the Hungarian athlete Gy√∂ngyi Dani, who came in ninth.
In the women's seated team, four skiers did not finish the race, and among the 117 skiers in the giant slalom, 45 did not receive a ranking in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Superintendent D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five suspects accused of raping the Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants' names are Baba Kanggarl, Busa Kanggarl, Lanpulo Kanggarl, Gaza Kanggarl, and Vishnu Kanggarl.
Officer Chandra Sekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court masked.
Although there were three people inside the house when the vehicle crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver's head was seriously injured.
Emergency rescuers temporarily closed the section of the road after rescuing the driver from the red Audi TT.
In the beginning, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was later charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh County Court.
She is currently detained, awaiting prosecution and trial, but since her image has been widely disseminated, any witness testimony may be compromised.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the operation of the judiciary in Scotland is different, with the court believing that publishing photos could cause potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out: "If photos and other information of suspects are published, journalists indeed appear to be walking a fine line."
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, responsible for overall prosecution matters, told reporters that no further comments would be made at least before prosecution.
According to leaked documents, the document will mention that Palestine wishes to base this border dispute on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics in the document are said to include the future direction of Jerusalem, a holy city shared by both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that if an agreement is signed, it will continue to station troops in the Jordan Valley for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to only keep the troops for five years.
Hunters participating in the pest control reinforcement trials will be closely monitored by national park managers, as relevant authorities need to monitor and evaluate the performance of these trials.
The New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) collaborated with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) to recruit eligible volunteers under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of the Park Conservation and Heritage Unit at the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting have undergone comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Maderly was sworn in yesterday to the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which is composed of nine members.
This is the fifth interim election committee in four years under Ma Deli.
As part of a comprehensive package to propel the country towards a new election, the presidential committee recommended the resignation of the former interim election committee last month.
The committee was established by Maderli in response to large-scale anti-government protests that started in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the inability to hold elections, some of which were supposed to be held as far back as 2011.
According to reports, there have been approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating, resulting in a total of 6 fires and causing minor burns to 4 people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that 27 incidents have been reported related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 overheating incidents to them, which the company claimed were "not serious."
The government department responded, saying that Apple's delay in reporting is "regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no reports of domestic damage have been received.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated there is no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took them as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six people have been confirmed dead.
They first released six hostages, including children and the elderly, just like the Filipino photographer.
Two photographers were later exchanged with an old woman who needed to use the restroom. Eventually, Mendoza was shot dead.
Likins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began practicing at the National Women‚Äôs Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Sir Liggins was working at the hospital, he used his time after work to study the phenomenon of premature birth.
His research shows that if a certain hormone is administered, it will accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Tormen once said, "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a double moon night, very special, just like she was. A strong woman."
The famous wrestler "Goldust" Dustin Runnels commented, "Luna was as bizarre as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place."
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated her belief that Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
In the poll, 34% of people agreed with the view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last monarch of Australia.
Among the two extreme results of the poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was originally set to compete in the Commonwealth Games' 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle events, as well as three swimming relay events, but his symptoms have raised concerns about his physical condition.
He cannot take medication to suppress the pain because those drugs are banned by the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
By early February, several people had verified the discovery using different hardware and software, and it was officially announced on Tuesday.
The water on Earth may have been brought by comets, and the organic matter in the water can form proteins and provide the necessities for life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially Earth, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described these rumors as "political gossip and ignorance."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the United States Federal Aviation Administration to enable aircraft to shorten flight paths, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and significantly reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the old ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No alternative transportation methods are provided, and the railway will not stop at Wembley. Additionally, there is no available parking or park-and-ride planning at the site.
Due to concerns about inconvenient transportation, the game might have to start under circumstances where supporters from each team are unable to attend and cheer.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported that a new bird species is forming in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Although it was previously believed that the evolution of new species took a longer time, researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Switzerland have discovered that this new species evolved within just two generations. It is a hybrid of the locally endemic Geospiza fortis and the introduced Geospiza fortis.
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
Gold can be drawn into fine threads, then twisted and woven. It can also be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. Since it can be made very thin, it is sometimes used in a type of book known as "illuminated manuscripts" to decorate the hand-drawn pictures within.
This is called the pH level in chemistry. You can use purple cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice will change color based on the acidity or alkalinity of chemicals.
The pH value is determined by the hydrogen ion concentration in a chemical substance (the H in pH stands for hydrogen).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (because a hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix these two types of dry powder together, then use clean hands moistened with water to squeeze it into a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layer, creating a peculiar texture and forming a kind of outer shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
In the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini, remnants of a sewage system were discovered beneath the houses.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses with mixed-gender bathing.
When calling a friend who is far away, it is achieved through artificial satellites.
The artificial satellite in space receives the signal and instantaneously reflects it back to Earth.
Artificial satellites are sent into space using rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere can sometimes distort our light and vision.
It requires a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has transformed the world in astonishing ways. The greatest contribution of the wheel to humanity is providing us with simpler and faster means of transportation.
It has brought us trains, automobiles, and other means of transportation.
Below them are a wider variety of medium-sized felines, primarily feeding on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelope, and deer.
Finally, many small cats (occasionally domestic cats) also prey on a large number of small prey, including insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to success lies in the concept of niches, meaning that the work each cat has to do is unique, so they won't compete with each other.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups known as prides.
A pride of lions consists of one to three adult male lions, plus up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
Lionesses are usually close relatives to each other, being sisters and daughters in the same large family.
The behavior of lion prides is very similar to that of wolf packs or dog groups; these two types of animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not including other large felines), and they are also very ruthless towards their prey.
Tigers are versatile athletes, capable of climbing (although not very specialized), swimming, long-distance leaping, and possessing a pulling force more than five times that of a strong human.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). Only these four types of felines have the ability to roar.
A tiger's roar, unlike a lion's roar which is purely vocal, is more like a chaotic, shouted phrase.
The ocelots like to eat small animals; they hunt monkeys, snakes, and rodents, and they will also hunt birds if possible. Almost all of the ocelots' prey are much smaller than their own size.
Scientists believe that ocelots rely on their sense of smell to track and locate prey, using sniffing to find the areas where prey frequents.
They have good night vision at night and can move quietly. The hunting strategy of the ocelot is to blend in with the surroundings before pouncing on its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from their main population (for example, by crossing a mountain range or river, or by migrating to a new island, making it difficult to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they came from.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, therefore the new population needs different traits or changes in order to possess stronger competitiveness than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, so it still requires the same adaptive functions as before.
As time passed, the newborn population began to adapt to the new environment, and their appearances became increasingly different from others.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, these two groups might look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence of the evolutionary process and is also a very important part.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. At the same time, plants can also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes, and most of the food we eat also comes from plants; without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurs were the apex predators of that era, so they feared no creature except other mosasaurs.
Its long lower jaw is lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with another set of teeth on the upper jaw, indicating that no creature in its sight can escape.
Although it cannot be confirmed, we think it might have a bifurcated tongue. It would eat turtles, large fish, other mosasaurus dinosaurs, and possibly even its own kind.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus rex is no match for it.
While most of the Roman food is familiar to us, they did eat some strange or rare foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat their food sitting on chairs, wealthy men prefer to attend banquets and enjoy their feasts reclining at the table.
The cuisine of ancient Rome did not include foods that were introduced to Europe in the following centuries from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they didn't have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans never ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, and those temples were regarded as the homes of the gods.
People prepare offerings for the gods, and priests strive to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has a spacious temple courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Some temples have special pyramid-shaped towers built within them, which are called pagodas.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary of the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not as important.
In Jewish family life, most moments are spent outdoors.
The women would cook in the yard; the shop was nothing more than a counter facing the street. People of that time would use stones to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so lumber was particularly expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it this name.
However, regardless of his findings, the Eskimo tribe had already been living there at that time.
Although every country is "Scandinavian," there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the "Declaration of Independence."
However, that is not the case. Although there are some handwritten notes on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The text on the back of the "Declaration of Independence" is "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is written upside down at the bottom.
Although no one knows who wrote this piece of text, it is certain that this large parchment document (approximately 29¬æ inches by 24¬Ω inches in size) was rolled up for storage early on.
Therefore, adding this statement is likely just for labeling purposes.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unfreed.
The area was governed by the French "Vichy" regime. These French people coexisted peacefully with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than opposing them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an offensive on southern France, historically known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is the unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together cooperatively, that is, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "of a citizen." It is related to the Latin words "civis" and "civitas," which mean "citizen" and "city or city-state," respectively. This, in a way, also defines the scale of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations, civilizations and cultures signify the knowledge passed down through generations, an unbroken cultural trace, and universal dissemination.
Smaller cultures often vanish without leaving historical traces and cannot be recognized as orthodox civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, these thirteen states first established a fragile central government under the Articles of Confederation (of which Congress was its only institution).
Congress does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial branch, it must rely on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce laws.
It also has no authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
These regulations require the unanimous consent of all the states to be amended, but the states have a very casual attitude towards the central government, with their representatives frequently absent.
The Italy national football team and the Germany national football team are both the second most successful teams in the world, and they were also the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where Italians also participate in related international and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island nation!
Due to the fact that Japan has a group of islands, from a geographical perspective, Japan is often classified as an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Formosa, meaning "beautiful island," as they passed by.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of the indigenous people's grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers to work in the company's rice and sugarcane fields.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) government took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan by force and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after the Qing government was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), it signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. Japan then began its rule over Taiwan, which lasted until 1945.
Machu Picchu is comprised of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the ruins have been reconstructed so that visitors can better understand their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was also the main film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, the digital camera's image sensor specification has adopted its aspect ratio.
In fact, that 35mm format is somewhat confusing, as it is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
This format's aspect ratio (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS Advanced Photo System format) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often-abused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that maintains order in an image while fostering creativity.
It points out that after dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally, the intersections of the lines are the most effective positions for the subject of the photograph (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under strict scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, despite the persistent differences in language and customs, Christianity has kept the countries of Europe closely connected.
Its omnipresent power influences everyone, from kings to commoners.
Christianity has a main principle, namely that wealth must be used to help those who are suffering and poor, and church funds are specifically set up for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the power core of the Church has been located in Rome, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether the Church truly adheres to its doctrines.
Shortly after the outbreak of war, Britain began to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy of cutting off the supply of essential military and civilian resources has indeed been effective, although this method of blockade has violated international regulations established by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries, which have been widely accepted by various countries.
The United Kingdom has deployed sea mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire area, even endangering neutral vessels.
Due to the lack of response from various countries to this tactic, Germany thus believed that their unrestricted submarine warfare would not incite a strong backlash.
In the 1920s, the general attitude of most citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, all countries hoped to avoid such a situation from occurring again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job with Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written for him by Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used unique methods to signify different periods; the various phases of China or the ruling families each belonged to distinctly different dynasties.
The period of regime change is also a time of fragmentation and turmoil in various regions. The most famous of these is the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, many nobles engaged in fierce wars to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne in the magnificent imperial palace of Xi'an.
The revolution brought about various social and political impacts, such as the adoption of public measurement systems, the shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than solely to the monarch.
Moreover, after the revolution, all types of positions were opened to all men actively seeking employment, allowing those who were most willing and accomplished to take charge.
The same situation also occurred in the army, because at this time they no longer used ranks to differentiate military hierarchy, but based it on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes in many other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters of transcending this worldly realm. He often went to a cave called "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself has undergone historical changes, presenting a vivid aspect of the spirit of Muhammad.

In fact, even if someone knows of its existence, it is not easy to find. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen; inside the cave, only a small part of the world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, and it is one of the many large pyramid structures erected to commemorate the deceased Pharaoh.
Located on the Giza Plateau of the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, the "Giza Pyramid Complex" includes several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest in the world), several small tombs, several temples, and the massive Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives, concubines, and family members.
The "upward bow" symbol looks like a V, while the "downward bow" symbol resembles a staple and also looks like a square with an open bottom.
The upper indicates that you should push the bow from the tip, while the lower indicates that you should pull the bow from the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow).
The up-bow mark usually represents a softer sound, while the down-bow mark indicates a more intense and firm sound.
Please feel free to make marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed bowing marks on the page have musical purposes and should not be ignored.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie Th√©r√®se and 4-year-old Louis Charles), along with the King's sister, Princess √âlisabeth, were forced by a group of market women to move from the Palace of Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded along the way by a mob, with the crowd shouting and hurling threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage.
At one point, a member of the mob even waved the head of a royal guard, who had been killed at the Palace of Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of the war waged by American imperialism against the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government, covering most of the government expenditures, while the bond interest was floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, for a long time, the United States' exploitation of Filipinos for exorbitant profits has been a fundamental gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that prompted the founding of this organization.
This period during which these events occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, which corresponds to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (A.D. 1000‚Äì1300).
The High Middle Ages follow the Early Middle Ages and precede the Late Middle Ages, and it is traditionally believed that the Middle Ages ended around the year 1500.
The term technological determinism encompasses many implemented concepts, ranging from technology-driven or technology-dominated transformations to the more rigorous view that "the relevant logic behind scientific laws and their manifestations in technology will drive human destiny."
Most interpretations of technological determinism encompass two main ideas: the trajectory of technological development has a greater impact than cultural or political factors, and technology, in turn, "influences" the inherent patterns of society rather than being constrained by societal norms.
For example, some people say that cars will inevitably drive the development of roads.
However, it was not economically feasible to build a nationwide highway network for a small number of cars, so people developed new manufacturing methods to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The increase in the number of car owners also raises the likelihood of road accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new medical technologies for repairing injured limbs.
Cultural determinism is one of the important components of romanticism, often drawing from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geographical environment shapes individuals, and over time gives rise to customs and culture associated with that geographical environment. These customs and culture, being harmonious and consistent with the local society, are better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is hailed as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was also hailed as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its status gradually declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with souvenirs such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than the goods sold in the Byzantine market.
It was at this moment that the title of the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a unique style. One major advancement at the time was that members of the Crusades started using buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming where crop yields are just enough to feed the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple agricultural system that typically utilizes organic farming, preserves and uses seeds of native crops from local ecological zones, and employs crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and many developing countries still do.
Subcultures allow people with similar interests, who also feel ignored by the mainstream society, to come together, thereby generating a sense of identity.
A subculture can be distinctly characterized by the age group, race, class, geographic location, or gender of its members.
The characteristics that establish a subculture may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or various other factors.
Members of subcultures typically express their belonging to the group through specific and symbolic forms, which include clothing, behavior, and the use of jargon.
A common method used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite several unfortunate cases of children who, during their growth process, suffered from neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse and therefore did not receive the socialization process imparted by adults.
These children are known as "feral children." Some feral children have been subjected to confinement (often by their parents); in certain instances, a child is abandoned because the parents do not accept that the child has severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Before being abandoned or running away from home, homeless children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma.
Other children are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If a feral child is completely raised by non-human animals, they will exhibit behavior almost identical to the animals that cared for them (if physiological conditions allow), such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning makes learning easier and more fun, while scaffolded learning takes it to the next level.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but an aid that can provide support for people undergoing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be either virtual or physical; in other words, both teachers and Microsoft Office‚Äôs Clippy are forms of scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software, with the function of asking questions, providing hints, and explaining procedures that students might find difficult to handle on their own.
There are many reasons why children are sent to foster care centers, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking nurturing, care, and education, but the reality is not so.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Foster families should provide all the necessities that were lacking in their previous families.
The internet combines the elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
From the perspective of use and satisfaction, the distinctive characteristics of the Internet have opened up new horizons.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" can both be said to be important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
In their 1998 study, Eighmey and McCord discovered that "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" are also new motivational dimensions when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, some believe that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out that people who are unable to understand the content of a speech due to brain damage can still accurately perceive the speaker's sincerity.
He even believes that animals like domestic dogs may have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown two types of gene variations: recessive and dominant.
Mutations introduce new genetic variations, while natural selection removes them from the dominant variation pool.
In every generation, separation and recombination cause both dominant and recessive genes to constantly undergo changes.
The digestive systems of primates similar to humans find it difficult to extract enough amino acids from the plants on the savanna.
Moreover, insufficient intake of amino acids can lead to serious consequences: poor growth and malnutrition, eventually resulting in death.
The most readily accessible plant resources are the proteins available from leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
Conversely, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
After considering all the factors, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a manner similar to that of chimpanzees on the savannas today.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of deliberately waking up during a normal sleep period and then falling asleep again in a short amount of time (10-60 minutes later).
By using a relatively quiet alarm clock, you can achieve this easily by becoming conscious but not completely awake.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, you can place the alarm on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on physiological cycles include drinking a large amount of liquid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, forcing a person to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The more relaxed the body and mind, the stronger the vitality one possesses. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach the state of enlightenment. The only obstacles on the path to enlightenment are our own anxieties and negative energy.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has flourished due to the path of compassion in Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, including Kundalini yoga, meditation, and devotional practices that embrace all beings.
During Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantra prayers, and visualization.
The core of meditation in Tibetan Buddhism is deity yoga. Through visualization of deities, all energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is established.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, prompting cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts in systems, practices, and culture created rifts between these nations.
The Second World War had ended for no more than two years when the original allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It continued for forty years with proxy armies engaging in real battles on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense line had been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup by the bridgehead near Romania.
However, these plans were all scrapped overnight. More than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements to invade eastern Poland, and subsequently entered Belarus and Ukraine, forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is currently the most efficient way to move large quantities of personnel and cargo across the sea.
Traditionally, the mission of the navy is to ensure the safe transfer of people and goods for the nation while disrupting the operations of enemy nations in transferring personnel and goods.
One of the most noteworthy examples in modern times is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to assist the United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the German navy attempted to disrupt transportation (primarily using U-boats).
If the Allies were defeated, Germany might conquer the United Kingdom just as they did with other parts of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them in order to obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats are generally grazed in hills or other pasture areas, usually cared for by child or adolescent goatherds, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
England built horse-drawn railways as early as the 16th century.
Although the four-wheeled freight track was only made of parallel wooden slats, it allowed horses to pull goods along the track. Compared to the slightly uneven road surfaces of the time, transportation was faster and could carry more goods.
Railway sleepers were used early on to fix the tracks in place. But gradually, it was discovered that laying down iron bars made the tracks more efficient.
This became a common practice, but the iron would cause more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriage.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway came into existence.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking. With the emergence of Homo Erectus (also known as upright man), humans began walking upright around two million years ago.
Their evolutionary predecessors, the Australopithecines, were not accustomed to walking upright.
The characteristic of bipedal movement was discovered in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly life, we can engage in environmental movements, and we can even become social activists to minimize future suffering as much as possible.
In many situations, this is just like "treating the head when you have a headache, and treating the foot when you have a foot ache." However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we should find the root cause of the problem and thoroughly resolve it.
This world has changed due to the progress of human science and technology, and the problems are exacerbated by overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of humans, which is more than obvious.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
150 to 200 copies were printed overnight, now referred to as "the Delep single-sided print edition."
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and George Washington read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known surviving Dunlap broadside copies are the oldest extant versions of this document, as the original manuscript has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, which we call birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people do not consider them to be a type of dinosaur.
However, birds and dinosaurs still have many similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
In fact, all computers now operate based on information composed of binary code.
A binary number can only have one of the two values, 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or in computer terminology, bits.
Toxicity within the body may not manifest immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are too common to make a direct diagnosis based on them.
The best way to determine signs of poisoning in the body may be to find containers of opened medication or toxic household chemicals.
Review the first aid instructions on the label of the specific poison.
The term "stink bug" is the formal designation entomologists use for this type of insect.
The name originates from ancient understanding of bedbugs‚Äîthey are highly adapted insects that parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs have the characteristic of growing within nests and can adapt to living in nests or the residences of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
Couples may determine that raising a baby is not in their or the child's best interest.
These partners can choose to plan to adopt their children.
Adoption refers to the termination of parental rights by the biological parents, allowing another couple to raise their children.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world operates through scientific methods. In fact, this approach also guides most scientific research.
However, the experimental method is not the only one; experiments are tests that can eliminate one or more hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's viewpoints on scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the Western world was cut off from its roots in Greek philosophy and science.
Many scholars have observed that physiological and behavioral rhythms often heavily depend on the endogenous biological cycles and the substances produced by the physiological clock.
Not only do circadian rhythms respond to external cyclical cues, but they can also be observed in most organisms such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues to operate autonomously in cycles even without external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the key experiments demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments: one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA in bacteriophages, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the proteins of the bacteriophages.
The effects of mutations can vary depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells will be inherited by offspring, while mutations in other areas can lead to cell death or cancer.
Tourism itineraries with a nature theme will attract people who are interested in nature to participate, in order to enjoy natural landscapes, including wildlife.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem-related information.
For example, visiting Borneo to film and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, a group of people drive away from the small country town to their workplaces, passing by another group whose starting point is exactly the workplace of the first group of people.
In this busy traffic flow, everyone has some level of connection with this car-based transportation system and also supports its existence.
Science now indicates that such large-scale carbon economic activities have already shifted the biosphere away from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality and bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system attract these complaints, and why are there problems every day? Is it because the transportation engineers are incompetent, or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations, as well as the interactions between road users.
The problem is that because it is impossible to predict driving habits with 100% accuracy, studying traffic flow is very difficult.
Fortunately, driving behavior tends to fall within a reasonably consistent range, and as a result, traffic flow also tends to exhibit reasonable consistency, which can be roughly expressed mathematically.
In order to more accurately represent traffic flow, we have defined the relationship among three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly allows them to more easily evade predators and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more small places to burrow into to escape predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people think he is right, but many hold the opposite view; they believe that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable because the Earth does not feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and has the largest volume of water. Its water volume is eight times that of the world's second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching six miles in width.
Of all the river water flowing into the oceans on Earth, a full 20% comes from the Amazon River.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, gathering water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale and extraordinary craftsmanship of the Giza pyramids were unmatched.
The Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were astonished by the historical monuments left by their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around eight hundred people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the smallest population.
Vatican laws and official documents are all in Italian.
Italian is also the language commonly used by the majority of the working population in the country, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have recognized basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because these elements exist in their natural form in nature, and extracting them with primitive tools is quite simple.
The philosopher Aristotle argued that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (arranged in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also inferred that they would transform into new substances to form the things we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain small amounts of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
All things in the universe are made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when pencils were first introduced, they became good friends to many people.
Unfortunately, with the rise of new writing methods, the status and usage rate of pencils have gradually declined.
Everyone is now typing messages on computer screens and no longer needs to use pencil sharpeners.
We can only wonder, when new inventions appear again, what will become of the keyboard.
The operational principle of a nuclear fission bomb is based on the fact that fusing many protons and neutrons into a nucleus requires a large amount of energy.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the atomic nucleus again will subsequently release a portion of that energy.
The cores of some atoms are unstable, which means they can easily split even with little or no force.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately seventy kilometers thick at the near end and about one hundred kilometers thick at the far end.
It is thinner under the lunar mare and thicker under the highlands.
Perhaps there are more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for magma to surface here.
The core of content theory is to identify things that move or attract people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that become internalized during the process of growing up.
These theoretical discussions explore what makes certain people want certain things, and what in their environment makes them want to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, when a supervisor begins to lead their former peers, two types of behaviors may arise. One is attempting to maintain oneself as still a member of the peer group.
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, enforce disciplinary actions, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and ensure subordinates fulfill their duties.
On the other end of the spectrum, there will be a completely different person who believes they must change all the practices the team has always followed and adopt their own way of doing things.
After all, a leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates a divide between the leader and other team members.
Virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members are often the points of contact for the corresponding physical teams they work directly with.
They usually have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their team may need to coordinate meetings across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The genuinely "invisible management team" (excerpted from Larson and LaFasto's 1989 book, page 109) is also a unique element that constitutes a virtual team.
"The 'Invisible Team' is a management team, with each member directly belonging to this team, and this team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to establish a learning institution? One of the goals of putting an organization's learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When each functional department within the organization effectively utilizes all available resources, it can unleash creativity and originality.
Therefore, the process of organizational collaboration to overcome obstacles can drive the innovation process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can have innovation capabilities, leaders should foster a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explained the continuous model, which is a method used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide concrete evidence for theoretical approaches in cognitive research, thus narrowing and refining the scope of study.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in conducting research.
For a long time, it has been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, abnormalities, and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The invention of new technology enables us to observe and study previously unseen brain structures and functioning processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which helps us understand the processes of how our mind works.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it remains a crucial branch of computer science, specializing in the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
One of the focuses of artificial intelligence research is the creation of machines capable of automatically executing tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and issues, as well as recognizing handwritten text, voices, and faces.
These things have developed into different disciplines, with the focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also built into some home computers and video game software.
Off-campus teaching is an important part of school education. Often, teachers want to take students to places that buses cannot reach.
Technology offers virtual off-campus learning as a solution. Students can sit in the classroom and visit museum artworks, tour aquariums, or admire beautiful art.
Sharing field trips through virtual means is also a good way to review the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year for their visit to the state's capital. This website is updated annually, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of readers.
Since students are often the most critical readers, bloggers will start working hard to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Writing blogs "also forces students to better understand the world around them." To satisfy the interests of the audience, it inspires students to become smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is an inspirational collaborative tool that can encourage students to extend their learning far beyond traditional school life.
Proper use of blogs "can enhance students' ability to analyze and critique; students can actively respond to online materials to clearly define their position within the context of articles written by others, and outline their own viewpoints on specific issues" (Olaus, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, with a beautiful and pleasant environment. It uses both English and French languages, and has many galleries and museums that showcase the past and present aspects of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north are Muskoka and other regions, where the natural beauty remains undeveloped and untouched.
All of the above and various other factors make Ontario be seen by outsiders as the typical image of Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, with some regions being virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising population comparison for many: There are more African Americans living within the United States than the citizen population of Canada.
The East African islands are located off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is the largest among the islands, with abundant wildlife, making the island itself akin to a continent.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent countries or have ties to France and are known for their luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and Islam saw significant development in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
To the north, it borders the Sahel region; to the south and west, it is adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers, regardless of their actual marital status, claim to be married.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (but do not wear one that looks too expensive).
Female friends should also understand that cultural differences may lead to situations that they consider harassment, such as being followed or having their arm grabbed, which are not uncommon.
When rejecting men, one should be firm and not be afraid to stand one's ground (regardless of cultural differences, this is always wrong!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese leveled and rebuilt the city, naming it "Casa Branca" (White House), and abandoned the place after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco and named "Daru I Badiya." "Casablanca," on the other hand, was the name given by Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
In the Medina old town area, places selling traditional Moroccan goods can be easily found, including tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and various flashy ornaments, but these are all sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the easternmost part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, with most of the city's streets, especially the downtown area, being buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, if you want to travel to areas outside of Goma, you must do thorough research and understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, where some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking activities in Africa can be conducted.
You can use a Boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to tour Goma, with the short-distance price generally around 500 Congolese Francs locally.
Because it is relatively difficult to access, "Timbuktu" has gradually become a symbol of a distant and exotic place.
Today's Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken town, but its past reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was included on the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sandstorms.
This is one of the main stops of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city differs significantly from other domestic cities as it tends to have an Arabian rather than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and is bounded by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,000 square kilometers, divided into fourteen ecological zones, where different wildlife habitats exist.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is also regarded as the flagship attraction of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, this park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
Perhaps purchasing a Wild Card multi-pass would be more cost-effective, as this pass allows you to enter certain selected parks in South Africa, or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and is also a major attraction for many tourists.
Some say that the entire row of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline, set against the waters of Victoria Harbour, resembles a brilliantly shining bar chart.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, you can leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across the harbor.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
The British colonizers claimed this place as their own, so if you want to find evidence of colonial history on this land, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans forest has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage list. The area located within India is called Sundarbans National Park.
This forest not only contains mangrove swamps, but also includes a portion of the vast jungle that once covered the Gangetic plains, of which very little remains today.
The Sundarbans forest covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water or swamps.
Since 1966, Sudarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is currently estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart all day from the inter-district bus station (across the river), but most buses leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading to the East and Jakar / Bumthang.
Due to the frequent full capacity of the interval bus, it is recommended that you purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas can be reached by comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster buses.
Ride-sharing taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, with a length of 378 meters, and the two lanes are each 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully opened to traffic in September 2017‚Äîthe same time the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani people are the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay, leading a semi-nomadic lifestyle while also engaging in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guacuru and the Payagua, who sustain themselves through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay (previously known as "The Giant Province of the Indies") was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous people.
The Spanish began a three-century-long period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of its local characteristics and features.
Argentina is renowned for having world-class polo teams and players.
The biggest event of the year will be held in December at the La Canitas Polo Field.
Other smaller tournaments or competitions are also held at other times of the year.
For information about the event and tickets for the polo match, please contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands is located in Stanley, opposite the "Falkland Islands Company (FIC) West Store," and it is the only place where currency can be exchanged.
In general, British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
In the outlying areas, it may be possible to use British or American currency, but credit cards may not be accepted; please inquire with the merchant in advance to confirm which payment methods can be used.
It is almost impossible to exchange its currency outside the Falkland Islands, so be sure to complete the exchange before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region, where temperatures often exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer.
The winters there can be deceptively cold because the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel much colder than what the thermometer shows.
There is no specific "rainy season" or "dry season," as the rainfall is approximately evenly distributed throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is, after all, wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities indicate that at least a distance of 100 yards/meters should be maintained from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 yards/meters from other wildlife.
No matter how docile they appear, bison, moose, elk, bears, and almost all large animals are aggressive.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they do not maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, untamed, and potentially dangerous, so please give them enough space.
In addition, be aware that scents can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking strongly scented foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa from 1959 to the present.
In 1889, this port was the site of the infamous naval standoff, during which seven warships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British vessel. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
During the independence movement organized by the Mau Movement, Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed during a peaceful gathering in the town.
Auckland spans two harbors, so it has many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
Northshore Beach (North Harbor Area) is located along the Pacific coast, extending from Long Bay in the north all the way to Devonport in the south.
Those places are almost all beaches where people can swim safely, and most have shade provided by New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, between Mission Bay and the upscale suburb of St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, lined with rows of shops along the shore. Swimming here is very safe.
The main local beer is "First." It is not a beer with a complex flavor, but rather a smooth and refreshing beer. Another local beer is called "Manta."
Although there are also many French wines, New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for long-distance transportation.
The local tap water is very safe and can be drunk directly, but if you are not assured, bottled water is also easily available.
For Australians, "white coffee" is a foreign concept. An espresso is "espresso," a cappuccino is coffee topped with a towering amount of fresh cream (not milk foam), and tea doesn't include milk.
The standard of the hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The juice is expensive, but very tasty.
Many people travel to the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and few get injured there as a result.
Tourists must still heed authorities' advice, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, box jellyfish appear near the beaches and estuaries north of 1770. Outside of these times, they can occasionally be found.
Sharks do exist, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The activities of saltwater crocodiles in the ocean are not active; their main habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows travelers to feel at ease, knowing they have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies usually collaborate with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodations through them, such as campsites.
The package tours offered by travel agencies usually include breakfast and airport transfers, and may even offer combinations of flights and hotels.
If you need time to consider the proposal or to gather other documents for your destination (such as a visa), they can also hold the reservation for you.
However, if you encounter any issues that need improvement or have any requests, you should contact the travel agency first instead of directly contacting the hotel.
During certain festivals, most visitors attending the music festival choose to camp on-site, and they generally believe that this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to watch the event up close, you must go in early and find a camping spot near the music performance.
Please remember that even after the main stage music performance is over, performances in other areas of the music festival may still continue late into the night.
For families with young children, some festival venues will arrange dedicated camping areas.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, please check the location of your cabin, because for the cabins most affected, passing through the floating ice can generate very frightening noise.
The St. Petersburg cruise itinerary includes city sightseeing. Passengers on the ship do not need to have a visa (check relevant regulations).
Casinos often go to great lengths to encourage guests to stay longer and spend more. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it is also difficult to find the exit.
They usually offer special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and retain them on the premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, getting drunk can impair judgment, and good gamblers are well aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who plans to drive in high-altitude areas or on mountain roads should consider how likely they are to encounter snowfall, icing, or below-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is very low, and you cannot drive as you would on ordinary asphalt roads.
During a blizzard, a sufficient amount of snow can fall in a very short time to immobilize you.
Snow or blowing snow, condensation, or icing on windows can all reduce visibility.
On the other hand, in many countries, ice and snow climates are very common, and transportation is almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari can be considered the most attractive tourist element in Africa and is also a highlight of many visitors' journeys.
The term "Safari" generally refers to land-based trips to admire the magnificent African wildlife, particularly the flora and fauna of the savannah.
Elephants and giraffes, these animals, often approach cars, so the standard equipment allows you to see more clearly.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes fear people getting close, so it's more suitable to observe them with binoculars.
A wilderness hiking trip (also known as bushwalking, wildlife hiking, or trekking) involves mountain climbing, and the duration can range from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several events will take place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympic Games, with the last one held in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the postponement was announced, the situation you are facing might be a bit tricky.
Cancellation policies vary, but after the end of March, most cancellation policies established due to the coronavirus were not extended to July 2020, which was the originally scheduled date for the Olympics.
It is expected that most event ticket prices will range from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with the average ticket price being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps to dry them. Many hotels allow guests to borrow an iron and ironing board even if they are not provided in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer to dry the socks, if you have one.
Be careful not to allow the fabric‚Äôs temperature to become too high (this may cause shrinkage, and in extreme cases, it may also scorch).
Among the many methods of purifying water, some can more effectively deal with specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other areas, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if you have any concerns, consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter pests that are uncommon in their own hometowns.
Pests can damage food and cause discomfort, and worse, they may trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or animals that harm or kill people, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without taxes and sales taxes in certain areas.
Travelers going to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on items like tobacco and alcohol.
The section between Bon Marien and Fairmont passes through many remote and desolate areas, and it is considered the most challenging stretch to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, please stay alert: steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp turns are predominant.
The speed limit is noticeably lower than the preceding and following sections of the road, generally 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 kilometers per hour), and strictly adhering to these speed limits is even more important than on other sections.
However, what's curious is that the mobile communication services here are much stronger than in other stretches along the way, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are very delicious, and the pastries from Bavaria are rich and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are quite common, with apples being made into pastries year-round, while cherries and plums appear on the dining table during the summer.
Many German baked goods often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cake items are usually particularly well-suited to be paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small and filling snack, you can try a type of fried jam pastry, which has different names depending on the region: Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, and it includes meat or vegetables.
Curry is classified as "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid content.
Yogurt is often used in curry dishes in Pakistan and inland areas of northern India, while coconut milk is more commonly used in southern India and other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent.
Indonesian cuisine, composed of food from over 17,000 islands, is a collective term that encompasses the country's wide variety of regional dishes.
However, when used without other modifiers, this term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine, which is available throughout Indonesia, mainly consists of various simply seasoned dishes. The most commonly used seasonings are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are used to support the rider's feet suspended on both sides of the saddle.
They can provide more stability for the rider, but there is a safety concern as the rider's feet may get stuck.
If a rider falls from a horse but one foot gets caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, many safety precautions can be implemented.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Furthermore, some saddles (especially English saddles) are equipped with safety handles that can be pulled back by the rider in the event of a fall, allowing the stirrup strap to detach from the saddle.
Cocham√≥ Valley, Chile's premier rock climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring a wide variety of large granite faces and cliffs.
There are breathtaking views at the mountain top. Climbers from all over the world continue to pioneer new routes on the cliffs with limitless potential.
Alpine skiing, including both skiing and snowboarding, is a widely popular sport, where the method of participation involves attaching skis or a snowboard to the feet and then gliding down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a popular travel event for many enthusiasts who are sometimes referred to as ski fans. They plan their entire vacation around skiing and stay at specific locations.
The concept of skiing has existed for a long time, and cave paintings as early as 5000 BC have already depicted people skiing.
The sport of alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as alpine skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
This activity is similar to alpine ski touring, but usually does not involve alpine skiing and mountaineering, both of which take place in steep terrain and require sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine the ski trails as similar hiking trails.
When conditions are good, the distance covered by snowfield load sliding will be slightly longer than hiking on foot, but you rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without heavy loads on a clear snow track.
Although the European continent is relatively small, there are many independent countries. Generally, traveling between several countries means having to apply for multiple visas and undergoing multiple passport checks.
However, in this regard, the way the Schengen Area operates is like a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, generally speaking, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally applicable definition for what man-made items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
Different geographical regions have different definitions; in places like North America, the age limit may be shorter than in Europe.
Although handicrafts exist for a shorter time than other mass-produced items of the same type, they may be considered antiques.
For the Sami people, reindeer herding is an important livelihood, and for the many Sami with different specialties, the surrounding culture of the herding industry is equally important.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami people were engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they made a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and regarded reindeer as draft animals for pulling heavy loads and carrying goods.
Today, many S√°mi people are involved in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in the S√°mi regions.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and misunderstandings about the Romani people.
If the country you intend to visit is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance might be affected.
Besides doing your own research, you might also want to consult the government for advice; however, their recommendations are designed for its citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The consultation opinion is just a brief summary of the political situation in a certain country.
Compared to the detailed information available from other sources, their perspectives are often more rough, general, and overly simplified.
Severe weather is a general term for all dangerous weather phenomena, which can potentially cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and comes in various forms, depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rain or snowstorms, and wildfires are manifestations and outcomes of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
It is strongly recommended that tourists pay attention to whether severe weather may affect the travel area, as severe weather may impact travel plans.
If someone plans to go to those countries considered as war zones, they should undergo professional training.
Searching "hostile environment training" on the internet will probably lead you to the addresses of local companies.
Courses are usually explained in a more detailed manner, often supplemented with practical experience, to address all the issues discussed here.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and involves role-playing, a significant amount of first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are very common, but publications related to war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid return documents.
Governments of different countries might not be willing to issue passports without specified gender (X), or to update documents for people desiring a specific name and gender.
There is a significant difference in the extent to which governments of different countries are willing to recognize these documents.
After September 11, 2001, the searches conducted at security checkpoints have become more stringent.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without compromising privacy and dignity.
A rip current is the wave that breaks off and returns after the sea waves hit the beach, and it usually appears near reefs or similar places.
According to the underwater topography, the rip currents will concentrate in certain deeper areas and may create rapid water flows directed towards the deep water zones.
The majority of fatal causes are due to exhaustion while trying to swim back against the ocean current, and the success rate of this action may be very slim.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than usual.
Try to swim towards a place where you won't get trapped again, or, depending on your personal swimming skills and whether someone has already noticed, you can also wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock occurs more quickly than culture shock (with less of a honeymoon period), lasts longer, and is more severe.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, sometimes readjusting and reintegrating into their own native culture can be particularly challenging.
After living abroad for a period and returning to your home country, you have adapted to the new culture and forgotten some of the habits that were formed by your domestic culture.
When you first arrive abroad, others know that travelers new to an unfamiliar country need time to adapt, and most will treat you with patience and understanding.
However, for those returning home, people might feel there is no longer a need to tolerate and understand them.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the night and quietly enjoy the view before the performance begins.
You usually hear the sounds of tourists and vendors all the time. The story interwoven with sound and light is like a storybook.
The performance uses the Sphinx as a backdrop, and it narrates a long story.
The scene is projected onto the pyramid, while the lights illuminate the other pyramids.
Several countries have claimed the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, as their territory. This island has the most bases, with sixteen active bases in use by 2020.
This archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the human settlement of Las Estrellas Town.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, the latter being a caldera of an active volcano, forming a spectacular natural harbor after being flooded.
Ellsworth Land is located south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountain ranges on the peninsula converge here to form a highland, then reemerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, which stretch for 360 kilometers and are divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountain range in Antarctica, Mount Vinson, has an elevation of 4,892 meters and is located in the northern part of Antarctica, also known as the Sentinel Range.
In remote areas where mobile signals are unavailable, you may only be able to use a satellite phone.
Generally speaking, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because you need to be outdoors and aligned with a satellite to make a call.
Vessels (including pleasure boats and expedition ships with remote data and audio needs) often use this service.
Your local telecommunications service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, an increasingly popular choice is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with recent graduates, allowing them to have a year off before graduating from college without sacrificing their studies.
Many times, participating in a gap year program abroad can actually increase your chances of receiving higher education when you return to your country.
Generally speaking, participating in these educational programs requires paying tuition fees.
Finland is a very suitable place for rowing. Known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," Finland also boasts thousands of lake islands and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, small boats, and even kayaks can offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The corresponding figures are found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in other regions, they appear quite exceptional (for example: in the Netherlands, this figure is 1 in 40).
Most Baltic-exclusive cruise itineraries will have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
In other words, you can spend several whole days exploring this historic ancient city and return to the ship at night to stay overnight.
If you are participating in a shore excursion with the ship, you do not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise itineraries introduce Berlin, Germany. As shown on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, so the cost of visiting this city is not included in the cruise fare.
Regardless of age or background, traveling by plane can be a frightening experience, especially for those who have never flown before or have had traumatic experiences.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from many people being afraid of or having an aversion to certain things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight may help them overcome their fear based on unknown or uncontrollable factors.
The courier company quickly delivers items and charges a handsome fee for doing so. Time is especially crucial when transporting business documents, goods, or parts for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own planes on some routes, but for other routes or for smaller companies, it can be more troublesome.
If they use air transport to ship items, it may take several days to complete unloading and customs clearance on certain routes.
The only way for faster delivery is to send the goods as checked baggage. Airlines prohibit checking in baggage for non-passengers, and that's where your opportunity arises.
To get a first-class or business-class seat, the most straightforward way is to take out a thick wad of cash to enjoy the privilege (there's an even better way, which is to have the company pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: roughly calculating, you would need to spend about four times the price of an economy class ticket to buy a business class ticket, and eleven times the price to buy a first class ticket!
Generally speaking, searching for discounts on business or first-class seats on a non-stop flight from point A to point B is futile.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core customer group in the market willing to pay a high price in exchange for reaching their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chi»ôinƒÉu. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic plagued by issues of ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the emergence of a self-proclaimed country called the Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova. The country has its own government and currency but has not been recognized by any United Nations member states.
Despite the failure of political consultations, economic links have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is the second-largest port after Istanbul and an excellent transportation hub.

Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, and this site holds significant meaning for a considerable number of people around the world.
Many of the men and women who were there at that time survived, while the loved ones of many more were killed or worked to death there, whether they were Jewish or not.
Please treat this site with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Please do not make markings or graffiti on the buildings to avoid damaging the appearance of the tourist attraction.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone understands Spanish.
However, most of the signs are displayed only in Catalan, as it is legally mandated as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other places.
The fixed announcements in the subway are only in Catalan, but the automated system unexpectedly interrupts with broadcasts in multiple languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, Japanese, and others.
Parisians have a notorious reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although living in Paris is said to mean showing the best side of oneself, this idea is often just an incorrect stereotype. However, behaving with the appearance of "bien √©lev√©" (well-mannered) still makes it easier for you to get along with others successfully.
If you display basic courtesy, the apparent rudeness of Parisians will quickly disappear.
The forests of Plitvice Lakes National Park are verdant, primarily consisting of beech, spruce, and fir trees, blending Alpine and Mediterranean plant landscapes.
Due to its range of microclimates, distinct soils, and varying elevations, it possesses a wide variety of plant communities.
This area also has an extremely rich variety of animals and birds.
There are rare animal groups such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and grouses, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that go below the knees and must not show their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide wraps for women who come unprepared, but if you have your own (especially in bright colors), the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover the knees.
You can also borrow inventory at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each user wears them, so you may feel slightly uncomfortable wearing these skirts. Men's clothing is all one size!
The diet of Mallorca is similar to other Mediterranean regions, primarily consisting of bread, vegetables, and meat (particularly pork), with a widespread use of olive oil.

All nouns and the word "Sie" (meaning "you"), even when they appear in the middle of a sentence, will still begin with a capital letter.
This is an important way to differentiate some verbs and objects.
This may also make reading easier, but writing becomes somewhat complicated due to the need to confirm whether to use a verb or an adjective in the nominalized form.
The pronunciation of Italian is relatively simple, as the spelling and pronunciation of most words are exactly the same.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows them.
Additionally, be sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" in different ways: "care" means dear, while "carro" means ancient chariot.
Persian grammar is relatively simple and mostly follows fixed rules.
Therefore, reading this grammar introduction helps in learning more about Persian grammar and enhances the understanding of phrases.
It goes without saying, if you know a Romance language, then Portuguese will be very easy for you to learn.
However, people with a slight understanding of Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is very similar to it and does not require special learning.
Premodern observatories are typically outdated today and continue to be used as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution was not as severe during the heyday of pre-modern observatories as it is now, they were typically located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than observatories built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as "Hanami," has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century AD.
This concept comes from China, and the Chinese appreciate plum blossoms.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other aristocrats around the imperial palace.
Plants are most beautiful in their natural environment, so please resist the temptation of "just picking one flower."
When you visit a meticulously arranged garden, collecting "samples" will also lead to your expulsion, leaving no room for discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to visit, with excellent transport links, and you can buy almost anything after entering the country.
However, since it is located only a few degrees north of the equator in the "high tropical zone," you will need to cope with the (usual) high temperatures and intense sunlight (this situation is less common when the sky is clear).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, which is the traditional burial site of biblical patriarchs such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Confirm that the bus you want to take will go to Hebron, and not just to the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways are an ideal themed vacation destination.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, or take a boat tour of the intriguing cities along the Danube River, or paddle along the Erie Canal.
The waterways can also form some popular hiking and biking routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many non-believers in Christian countries, as well as people around the world who do not follow Christianity, have also adopted these festival traditions.
There is a tradition during Easter to stay awake outdoors all night and watch the sunrise.
Of course, there is a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but it is likely that it existed as spring and harvest rituals even before the advent of Christianity.
More traditional churches usually hold an Easter vigil service on Saturday night of the Easter weekend, and at midnight, the participating congregation celebrates the resurrection of Jesus together.
All the animals that originally came to this island arrived by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to cross the sea, making giant tortoises the primary herbivores of the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans landed on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals including sheep, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs have been introduced to the islands.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience a polar night, meaning the sun will not rise above the horizon.
Because the sky is almost dark all day, it provides an excellent opportunity to view the Northern Lights.
Since these regions have sparse populations, there is usually no light pollution, and you can also enjoy the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Western people are accustomed to.
Suits are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, and emphasis should be placed on teamwork rather than glorifying individual achievements.
Most of the decisions made by employees require approval from their superiors, and they must comply with the superior's instructions without any objections.
