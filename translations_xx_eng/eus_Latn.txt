This confirms the theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers and also reveals some details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was chestnut-colored on the upper side and carotenoid-colored or dull-colored on the underside.
The discoveries also provide details about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed covering (called rachis) but do have other feather features (barbs); therefore, researchers have concluded that the rachis developed later in evolution than the other mentioned features.
From the structure of the feather, it can be deduced that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or changing appearance. According to the researchers' proposal, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows mature plumage, not the down feathers of a chick.

Huhne has resigned and Member of Parliament Ed Davey will replace him in the cabinet. Member of Parliament Norman Lamb, on the other hand, will take Davey's position as Business Minister.
According to what was scheduled, Huhne and Pryce will appear at Westminster Court on February 16.
Nicholas Alden (25) and Zachary Cuddeback (21) are the deceased. Cuddeback was the one driving.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, and Kristoffer Schneider will need reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's weapon misfired when aiming at the head of the fifth person. Schneider continues to be in pain, has one blind eye, is missing a part of his skull, and part of his face is reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via video call from a USAF base in his hometown.
Apart from Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two other individual races in the Championship.
The first test was the slalom, and he did not finish the course on the first descent. Out of 116 competitors, 36 had the same result in that race.
In the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group, with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes later than Austria's Claudia Loesch, who finished in first place, and 1:09.02 minutes later than Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four members of the women's sitting group did not manage to finish the descent, and out of the 117 skiers who participated in the giant slalom, 45 did not qualify.
Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
According to D K Arya, Deputy Chief Inspector, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her laptop and mobile phone."
These are the accused: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the judge with their faces covered.
Although when the cars collided with the house there were three people inside, none of them were injured.
However, the driver has serious head injuries.
The road that was the scene of the accident was temporarily closed while emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, they were taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, they took him to Addenbrooke's Hospital (Cambridge).
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court accused of murdering her son.
A complaint has been filed and is pending trial, but it is likely that the witnesses' evidence may not be entirely credible because his image has been published in many places.
In Great Britain, it is common to do so, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and in the opinion of the courts, publishing the photographs can be harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee, "journalists walk a fine line when they publish photos and so on of suspects."
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for the complaints, has told journalists that nothing else will be explained, at least until the complaint is made.
According to the leak, the document concerns the border incident, in which it is mentioned that Palestine wants to restore the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the information, among other topics being discussed are the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants to have military presence in the valley for the next ten years after the agreement is signed, while Palestine wants to limit the stay to five years.
The forest guards closely monitored the hunters who were in the complementary pest control test, as they were following the test and evaluating its effectiveness.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (New South Wales), qualified volunteers were chosen as part of the Hunting Program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training guidelines.
Martelly took the oath of the new nine-member Interim Electoral Commission (CEP) yesterday.
This is the fifth CEP Martelly has had in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended that the existing CEP should resign as part of the measures the country needs to take towards having new elections.
Martelly created the committee in October to respond to the spread of the protests against the regime.
Several protests broke out, sometimes violent, due to the inability to organize elections that had not been held since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods that have malfunctioned and overheated have been reported; in total, they have caused six fires, and four people have sustained minor burns.
According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI), there have been reports of 27 incidents related to the device.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had received 34 more cases of overheating, and, according to the company, they were "mild."
The ministry responded by saying it was "completely regrettable" that Apple had reported the cases later.
The earthquakes shook the Marianas at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT, Friday).
The emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands has stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has confirmed that there have been no signs of tsunamis.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have already been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly woman afterwards, as she had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed his father's career path and studied medicine.
After training as an obstetrician, she began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his free time.
Research showed that when a hormone was administered, the fetal lungs of the baby matured faster.
Xinhua said that government investigators recovered the flight's two 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by fellow fighters.
According to Tommy Dreamer, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. A special night, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as freaky as I was... maybe more than me... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Before the 2010 federal election, they conducted a survey among 1,400 people; and since 2008, the percentage of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by eight percent.
Julia Gillard, the interim prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the people who answered the survey have the same opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and in three relays was supposed to participate in the Commonwealth Games, but due to the injuries mentioned, their season is in doubt.
He has been unable to take the medicine he needs to relieve pain because it is banned in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known number.
By the beginning of February, several people had verified the discovery using various hardware and software, and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
It is likely that meteorites are one of the sources that supplied Earth with water, and also one of the sources of organic matter that can form proteins and help in the development of life.
Scientists want to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was created; in fact, asteroids collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo (53) began his duties as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages.
According to him, the rumors are "political chatter and nonsense."
He/She has made a remark about running for president in the 2016 elections.
According to the FAA, thanks to the NextGen system, aircraft will be able to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually, thereby reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to obsolete ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. There is no parking for cars and no park and ride facilities outside.
Fearful of a lack of transportation options, he proposed on the table the possibility of making the game for the people and the fans of the teams.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported that a new bird species was emerging in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have stated that a new species has formed in two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer; specifically, Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris) have interbred.
Gold can be shaped into any form. It can be twisted until tiny shapes are made.
It can be pulled until it becomes a thin cable; it can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered, or pressed until it becomes a sheet.
It can be made into a thin layer and adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted illustrations in books called “illuminated manuscripts.”
The pH of a chemical compound is called that. You can make an indicator using red cabbage water.
The color of red cabbage water changes according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical compound.
The pH level indicates how many hydrogen ions (the H in pH) are present in the chemical compound used for the test.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (in fact, a proton and an ion form a hydrogen atom).
Mix the two dry powders together and compress them with wet and clean hands until a ball is formed.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers, giving a unique sensation, and something like a shell will be formed.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a toilet that flushed water, connected to a sophisticated wastewater system.
Traces of a wastewater system have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, and men and women would be together.
When you call someone who is billions of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space via a spacecraft. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and view.
A spacecraft over 100 feet in height is needed to place a satellite or a telescope in space.
Wheels have changed the world in an astonishing way. The greatest thing wheels have done for us is providing the opportunity to transport more easily and quickly.
The train, car, and many other transport devices have been brought to us.
Below them, there are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many other small cats (including domesticated cats) that eat smaller, more abundant prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of the niche. Each type of cat performs a specific task, so as not to have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and tend to live in large groups.
Lion prides consist of one to three male lions, and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females have a closer relationship with each other, as they form a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides operate much like packs of wolves or dogs; they are very similar to lions in behavior (but they are not like other big cats) and are very dangerous to prey.
The tiger is a very good athlete, it can climb (even if not very well), swim, make big jumps, and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group as the lion, panther, and jaguar (the Panthera genus). Those four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, it bears more resemblance to a sentence composed of shouted threatening words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if possible. Almost all the animals that ocelots catch are smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and find animals (prey) they will eat, by sniffing the ground for traces.
Since they have night vision, they can see very well at night and are also able to move silently. Ocelots hide in the environment and catch their prey by surprise, jumping onto them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main original population (for example, by moving over a mountain range or a river, or being unable to easily return from a new island), it will often find itself in an environment unlike the previous one.
That environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore, new populations will need different characteristics or adaptations than before in order to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, as they still need the same adjustments they required before.
As time goes on, the new population begins to adapt to the new environment and has less and less resemblance to the original population.
Eventually, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will be so different from each other that they will not be able to be named with the same species name.
We call that process speciation; it simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is inevitable; it is an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants are nourished with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. Moreover, they also provide shade.
We make houses with pieces of plants, as well as clothes. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaurus was the top predator of the time; therefore, it feared no one, except perhaps other mosasauruses.
It had a long jaw filled with 70 sharp teeth and another set of teeth on its palate; therefore, nothing that crossed its path would have a chance to escape.
We are not sure, but it might also have had a bifid tongue. Turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs were part of its diet, and it is believed that it might have been a cannibal as well.
Moreover, it attacked anything that entered the water; even the big T. Rex dinosaur would not be a match for it.
Although most Roman foods are familiar to us, they also had strange or unusual dishes for banquets, including wild boar, peacock, snails, or a rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their food sitting, while wealthy men ate banquets together reclining to the side.
The ancient Romans could not eat foods that came to Europe from America or Asia several centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa either, and the ancient Romans did not taste turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each god, and considered it to be the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the god, and the priests tried to respond to the needs of the gods by holding ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, as well as an inner sanctuary that only priests could use.
Sometimes they built pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats as a component of the temple.
The top part of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the mild climate of the Near East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women prepared food in the courtyard; the shops had open counters facing the street. They used stone to build houses.
There were not many large forests in the land of Canaan, and therefore, wood was very expensive.
There have not been many towns in Greenland. It is mentioned in Scandinavian sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland due to a murder, and upon traveling westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Even though each of those countries was “Scandinavian,” there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, these words are written: "The Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document was originally rolled up for storage (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches).
Therefore, it is likely that the note was added simply as a label.
The landings of the day and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
The "Vichy" French were in power. In 1940, they were the French who made peace with the Germans, collaborating with the invaders instead of resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the allies invaded southern France through an invasion called “Operation Dragoon.”
In two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and began moving towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live together and work cooperatively, like a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis. It means polite and is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and, at the same time, it somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A culture with civilization means that knowledge is passed on over several generations, there is a cultural footprint, and proper dissemination is carried out.
Lower-level cultures disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government, with the congress being its only component, and it was under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, the state authorities had the authority to enforce its laws, although they often did not assist.
Furthermore, he/she had no authority to annul tax laws or charges between states.
They needed the unanimous approval of all the states before having the opportunity to amend the articles, and the states adopted the central government so lightly that their representatives often did not even show up.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German national team, is the second most successful national football team in the world, and they were the winners of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
In the northern regions, winter sports are the most practiced, and Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), and therefore, Japan is the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, it is geographically designated as an "archipelago."
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and named it Ilha Formosa, beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established itself in the southwest of Taiwan, and the activities of the indigenous inhabitants for producing crops began to be transformed, and workers from China began to be used to work on rice and sugar plantations there.
In 1683, the army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and it was designated a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and according to the agreement, Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to show tourists what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty-three percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and they are still continuing restoration work.
For example, in still photography, the 35 mm format is the most common in the world, as it was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, digital camera image sensor formats have continued its proportion.
Indeed, although it is confusing, the 35 mm format has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The proportion of this format (is divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio), therefore, is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format families) have the same or similar proportion.
The rule of thirds, which has been used too much and often ridiculed, is a simple guide to create dynamism in an image and, at the same time, maintain a bit of order.
According to the rules, the most effective places to position the main subject are the points where the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During that period of European history, a critical examination of the Catholic Church began, as it had become rich and powerful.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united the states of Europe, despite their different languages and customs.
His omnipotent power affected everyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church was established in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised doubts among many as to whether that principle was being fulfilled.
As soon as the hostilities broke out, Britain began to blockade German ships.
The cessation of the entry of basic military and civilian supplies was an effective strategy, but this blockade violated international law that had been codified and generally accepted through numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters, preventing vessels from entering large areas of the ocean and also posing a threat to neutral ships.
As a limited response was given to this tactic, Germany also hoped that its ongoing unrestricted submarine warfare would receive a similar response.
In the 1920s, in most citizens and nations, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolationism.
After experiencing the horrors and brutality of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to start working at the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation addressed to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of showcasing each era. Each era or family that held power in China was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, during the intervals between dynasties, there usually was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those times, there were brutal wars among nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died fighting for the right to sit on the highest seat of the great palace of Xi’an.
There are several social and political influences: for example, the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were placed in the hands of all men, and thanks to this, those with the most ambition and success advanced.
The same happened with the military, as the ranking in the army was now based on caliber instead of class.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired the working class in other countries to each launch their own revolution.
Muhammad had a keen interest in matters beyond everyday life. He often went to a cave to contemplate; the place was named "Hira," and it was located on "Noor" (light) mountain.
The caves, which have endured through time, clearly demonstrate Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave located on one of the northern mountains of Mecca is completely isolated from the world.
Moreover, even knowing the location, it is not easy to find. Inside the cave, the solitude is complete.
The only thing you can see is the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the ancient seven wonders that remains in its original state today.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the third century B.C. as one of the large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" located in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt has several pyramids, small tombs, and temples, as well as the Great Sphinx (and the largest pyramid of them all is the Great Pyramid).
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and smaller pyramids as well as many tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The mark to "move the arch up" has a V shape, and the mark to "move the arch down" has the shape of a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Going up means starting at the top and pushing the bow, and going down means starting at the base (where you hold the bow) and pulling from the bow.
An upward-moving arch produces a softer sound, while a downward-moving one generates a stronger and denser sound.
You can make your marks with a pencil, but the printed bow markings are placed for musical reasons, and therefore, they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), along with the king's sister, Elizabeth, were terrified by a large group of market women who forced them to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in the carriage accompanied by a noisy crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows fully open.
At a certain moment, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses that American imperialism incurred in the efforts to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
A large part of the expenses they were forced to pay to the colonial regime of the US and to pay the interest on the bonds issued through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the fundamental profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period of those events is known as the High Middle Ages in European history, and it encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (the years 1000-1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages, and after it, the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
In practice, technological determinism encompasses many ideas; whether it is the impulse or necessity caused by technology, or the belief that human destiny is guided by a hidden logic according to scientific laws (and the way they manifest in technology).
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the following two general ideas: on one hand, that the development of technology goes beyond any political or cultural power, and on the other hand, that technology, at the same time, has an “influence” on societies inherently, more than societies have on technology.
For example, it could be said that having motor vehicles inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable if there are only a few cars; therefore, new production methods are being developed to make owning a car more affordable.
The more widespread car ownership becomes, the more accidents occur on the roads; however, this also leads to the development of new techniques in the health sector for treating the injured.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, Schlegel, and the like.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and as time went on, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged. Since these matched the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the contemporary world, we consider Paris to be the fashion capital, but in feudal Europe, Constantinople was the center.
It began to be the epicenter of luxury around the year 400 A.D., and its fame lasted until around the year 1100 A.D.
Its prestige declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders, upon returning, brought gifts of silk fabrics and spices, and those goods were more valuable than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
At that time, Constantinople ceased to be the fashion capital, in favor of Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily influenced by the culture of the Eastern Byzantine Empire.
However, since the means of communication were slow, styles reached the west with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest innovations of that time came when the Crusaders began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
The agriculture that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families is called subsistence farming.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses saved seeds indigenous to an eco-region and simple techniques such as crop rotation or similar to achieve the largest possible harvest.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who think in similar ways and feel outside of societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
There are many ways to distinguish subcultures, such as age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture make distinctive and symbolic use of style to show their membership, which includes fashions, peculiarities, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is the unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or specific abuse while growing up, did not have the opportunity to socialize with adults.
Those children are called "wild". Some wild children were locked up by people (usually their parents), while others were abandoned by their parents because they did not accept the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
It is likely that the wild children experienced serious abuse or trauma in childhood before being left alone or running away.
Others, supposedly, were raised by animals; it is said that others have lived on their own in nature.
In cases of feral children raised by non-human animals, the behaviors tend to be almost identical to that of the particular guardian animal (within physical limits), such as fear of or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method takes it one step further.
The scaffolding method is not a method of learning but a way to support those who are immersed in a new learning experience, necessary, for example, when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is one type of scaffold, as is the Microsoft Office paperclip guy.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software, providing students with questions, notes, and explanations about procedures that may be difficult to manage on their own.
Children entering reception are there for various reasons, such as neglect, abuse, or coercion.
Children should not have to grow up in environments that do not support, care for, and educate them, but such things happen.
For such children, we believe that the Reception System is a safety zone.
Our reception systems must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The reception must provide all the needs that were missing in the homes they left behind.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
Thanks to the many features of the Internet, additional aspects related to use and satisfaction have been enabled.
For instance, "learning" and "socializing" are said to be the main motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as motivational factors when they investigated people's reactions to websites.
Important discoveries have been made using video recordings in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that by correctly interpreting micro-expressions, one can detect whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks stated in a scientific article, the President's speech, that people with brain damage who are unable to understand speech can accurately detect sincerity.
According to him/her, this ability to interpret human behavior is also possessed by other animals, for example, domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variants: concealed and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variants, while selection removes them from the set of expressed variants.
Separations and recombinations change variants from one set to another with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant resources available to it.
Furthermore, not achieving it can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would be the most accessible plant resources available, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us when they are not prepared.
Meanwhile, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs), in addition to being easy to digest, contain high-quality proteins with all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, it shouldn't come as a surprise to learn that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how savanna chimpanzees do today.
In the process of sleep interruption, you are specifically awakened during a normal sleep cycle and shortly thereafter, you fall asleep again (10-60 minutes).
That can be easily achieved by using a gentle alarm that causes you to be conscious but does not fully wake you up.
If you reset the clock while you are asleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Among the options based on biorhythms, one is to drink plenty of fluids before sleeping (especially water or tea, as it's a known diuretic) to force getting up to urinate.
The inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in one's body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more positive life force there is. All people have the ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the path to achieving that is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it spread with the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the path of love that includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and everything.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods. By visualizing various gods, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the enemy of many in World War II, and this brought about cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, as a result of clashes in systems, processes, and cultures, the countries distanced themselves from each other.
Two years after the war ended, those who had been allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
The war lasted for the next 40 years, and there were real battles, through army representatives, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize across the Romanian bridgehead.
However, almost overnight these plans became obsolete when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, and thus the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviets and the Polish, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, were violated.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional work of marines has been to maintain the ability of countries to move people and goods, while at the same time hindering the ability of enemies to move people and goods.
The most notable example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to send men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
Similarly, the German navy used U-boats to halt that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have been capable of conquering Great Britain, as it did with the rest of the European countries.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising goats to easily obtain milk, hair, meat, and leather.
They were usually kept in goat herds, working on hills or other grazing areas, often under the care of goat herders who were children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These shepherding methods are still used today.
Carriageways were already being built in the 16th century in England.
Although the tracks were nothing more than wooden parallel planks, thanks to being dragged by horses, they could achieve higher speeds and carry heavier loads on the rough roads of the time.
The attachments were added quite early to secure the tracks. Gradually, however, they realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top.
It became common, but because of the effect of iron, the wooden wheels of the carts wore out more.
Wooden wheels were finally replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first tracks made of solid iron were used.
The first known form of transportation is walking; in fact, humans began to walk upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their predecessor australopithecines did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization has been found in australopithecine fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but it is possible that Sahelanthropus also walked on two feet seven million years ago.
We can start living in a cleaner way with respect to the environment, we can join environmental mobilizations, and we can also be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we only want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems in order to solve them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot thanks to humanity's scientific and technological progress, and that problems have intensified due to overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyle.
After being approved in Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the nearby printing house of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies of what are known as "Dunlap papers" were made that night.
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of the copies was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his army on July 9, in New York. A copy reached London on August 10.
They are the oldest surviving copies of the document, the 25 Dunlap papers still in existence. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many contemporary paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Many people do not imagine them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many characteristics of birds are similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information, which is coded with binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (or in computer jargon, bits).
Intestinal intoxication may not be immediately apparent. Because vomiting and other symptoms are too general, an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
An open jar of medicines or toxic chemical cleaning products is the best indication of intestinal poisoning.
Read the label to find out what first aid is required for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "zimitz" to refer to that group of insects.
They have been given that name due to their resemblance to bedbugs in ancient times, as they have a great ability to be human parasites.
Both predatory bedbugs and bedbugs are nidicolous, and are accustomed to living in nests or on hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
According to research, women have twice the probability of developing EA compared to men.
It may happen that a couple decides that raising a baby is not the best for them or for the child.
That couple may make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights for another couple to become the child's parents.
By using the scientific method, the main goal of science is to understand how the world works. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
In any case, experimentation is not the only thing that needs to be done; moreover, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions, and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible written in Latin.
The viewpoints Aristotle had on all scientific matters were accepted, including philosophy.
As the knowledge of Greek diminished, the West distanced itself from the philosophical and scientific origins of Greece.
The presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks is decisive for the many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living organisms: in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators, which continue to operate on their own for a period even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence proving that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to inject their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments: marking the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or marking the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material it affects, and whether the cells affected are germline cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas, with the aim of enjoying the landscape (including fauna and flora).
Examples of in situ activities: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning information about the ecosystem.
Visiting Bornean orangutans, taking pictures of them, and learning about them, for example.
Every morning, people leave the small rural villages to go to work and cross paths with those who work in the place they have just left.
Within that transportation dynamic, everyone is somehow tied to a transport system based on private cars, and supports it.
According to science, this massive carbon economy has altered the stable state of the biosphere over the last two million years, which has supported human evolution.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost all are complaining about transport systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears so many complaints about water quality or about bridges about to collapse.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Are transport technicians unqualified? Or is there some fundamental problem?
Traffic flow examines the movement and interactions between individual drivers and vehicles between two destinations.
Unfortunately, analyzing the flow of traffic is difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally have quite regular behavior; therefore, traffic flows are quite consistent and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better express the flow of traffic, the relationships are specified in three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in road service planning, design, and management.
Insects were the first to start flying. Thanks to the ability to fly, they were able to avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings behind their bodies.
Thanks to that, they have more opportunities to hide in small places so they won't be caught by predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and all the other stars too).
It seems reasonable, as it doesn't seem that the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the largest river. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and the excellence of their construction technique.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then a thousand years old.
Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the lowest population.
In Vatican City, Italian is used in local laws and official communications.
Italian is also the common language of most people working in public services, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All of the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Gold, silver, copper, and other chemical elements have been known to people since ancient times, as they can be found in their native form in nature and can be fairly easily exploited with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. Those elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was similar to the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. To account for what we see, he also theorized that they transform into other substances.
Alloys, essentially, are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys with a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as those containing carbon.
All things in the universe are made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when the pencil was invented, it became a close friend of many people.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and usage.
People now write messages on computer screens, without any need to pick up a sharpener again.
Who knows what will happen to the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The operation of the fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like carrying a heavy cart up a slope. When the nucleus splits again, part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei; that is, they have a tendency to split with little or no help.
The surface of the moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km wide on the near side and about 100 km wide on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas, and thicker in the highlands.
There may be more moon seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
The aim of content theories is to understand what marks or attracts individuals.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires and that they internalize them as they reach adulthood.
These theories focus on two ideas: why people want things and what things in their environment will drive them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two well-known content theories.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when a director starts leading their former peers. On one hand, continuing to be the "team guy" (or girl).
Directors like these find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take measures to enforce discipline, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the other hand, the person becomes unrecognizable, feeling the need to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the key person responsible for the success and failure of the team.
That attitude often causes friction between the team leaders and the other members.
Virtual teams are formed with the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are a few small differences.
Members of virtual teams function as the interaction points of their direct physical team.
They often have more autonomy than members of traditional teams, perhaps because the teams meet according to changing time zones, which their local management does not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each team member informs. The invisible team sets the standards for each team member.
Why would an organization want to undergo the lengthy process of establishing an educational institution? Innovation is one of the goals of putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice.
When the available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and clarity of thought can move freely.
Consequently, from the process of working together to overcome an obstacle in an organization, innovative processes to meet customer needs can emerge.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum perspective as a method for organizations to achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical perspective on investigating cognition. Therefore, it narrows the research field and makes it much more precise.
Correlations between brain pathologies and behavior support scientists' research.
We have long known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to build stimulation models, which help us understand mental processes.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important branch of computer science that encompasses the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in a machine.
In studies related to AI, machines are prepared to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
To mention a few examples: control, planning and organization, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and queries, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Those things have become separate disciplines, aimed at providing solutions to life's problems.
AA systems are widely used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military domains, but also in certain software applications on home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of a classroom. Often, the teacher would like to take the students somewhere that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers the solution of virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artworks while seated next to their classmates.
Sharing a trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about the trip to the state capital. The website changes annually, but the older versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogs with poor grammar and spelling, having readers usually changes that.
Since discerning readers are often students, the author of the blog starts making efforts to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Similarly, writing blogs "encourages students to learn more about the world around them." The need to satisfy readers' interests inspires students to be insightful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing blogs is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond the typical school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can refine their own stance within the context of others' writings, as well as summarize their own viewpoint on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a wonderful and bilingual capital of Canada, with a good selection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, there is the natural, untapped beauty of Muskoka, and so on.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as the most Canadian of all Canadians, according to foreigners.
The wider areas located further north have few inhabitants, and some are almost uninhabited forests.
A comparison that amazes many people: The number of African Americans living in the USA is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The islands of Eastern Africa are in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by far and is, in terms of fauna, a unique continent.
Most small islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury vacation destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and they took over a large area in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route around the Cape to travel from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: all female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring also helps (but one that doesn't seem very expensive).
Women need to know that the behaviors they might consider as harassment could be cultural differences, and that it is common for someone to follow them, hold them by the arm, etc.
Be strong in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to hold firm (whether there are cultural differences or not, it's not appropriate!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 20th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish traders established trading posts and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is the place with the least interest for shopping in all of Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan items are easily found around the old medina, such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and all kinds of gadgets, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city; it is located in the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, next to Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma when lava covered the streets of the city, particularly the downtown area.
Although Goma is safe enough, all visits outside of Goma need to be examined to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
Likewise, the city is the starting point for ascending Mount Nyiragongo, as well as the cheapest route to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around the Goma area. The usual price (local) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
As it is somewhat difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor to talk about exotic and distant lands.
Today, it is a poor city, but its fame attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in danger due to the threat of the desert area.
Henry Louis Gates was one of the main stops on the PBS program's special episode of Africa's wonderful lands.
There is a marked difference between the city and other cities in the country, as it has an Arab touch instead of an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecozones, each with diverse fauna.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the emblem of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there are daily fees for entry and conservation.
Perhaps it is convenient for someone to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to South African parks or all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong, and it is the main point of interest for many tourists.
The parade of buildings making up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shiny bar chart, displayed with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbor.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the urban area of Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed area of the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonizers took for themselves; therefore, if you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, covering a width of 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The forest located in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not composed only of mangrove swamp thickets; they are also the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², about one-third of which is covered by water/mud.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are around 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 chital there.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since buses between districts often get crowded, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
In most districts, there is a service of Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable means of transport to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapok River and connects Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, and the bridge has a length of 378 meters and two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The bridge has a height of 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be operational in September 2017, once the customs procedures in Brazil are completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of Chaco was also home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá tribes. They lived thanks to hunting, harvesting, and fishing.
Paraguay in the 16th century, previously called the "giant province of the Indies," was the result of a mixture between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the era of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a large part of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is very famous for having the best polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here throughout the year.
If you want news about tournaments and information about places to purchase tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association's site.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), and its value is equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the island's sole bank, in Stanley. It is located past the FIC West store.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere, and credit cards and United States dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards might not be accepted, but British and American money is. Ask the owners in advance if you can use that payment method.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland Islands money outside the islands; therefore, exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical area, and during the summer months, it is common to have temperatures above 30ºC.
Winter can be very chilly; freezing is not common, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy" or "dry" season: a similar amount of rain falls throughout the year.
Even though most of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, remain at least 100 yards or meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards or meters away from other wild animals.
Although they may appear docile, bison, moose, bears, and other similar large animals can attack.
Every year, several visitors are injured for not maintaining the necessary distance. As these animals are large, wild, and dangerous, give them space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals. Therefore, avoid bringing or preparing strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was discovered in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The fierce naval clash of 1889 occurred in the port where seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for a British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During a peaceful gathering in the village, organized by the Mau movement in the fight for independence, the event led to the killing of the main leader named Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland is located between two harbors, there are many beaches; the most famous ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the northern coast (in the North Harbour district) are in the Pacific Ocean; they stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and there is usually the shade of pohutukawa trees.
On the Waitemata Harbor, in central Auckland, there are the Tamaki Drive beaches in the luxurious neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
Those beaches are usually filled with families, and there are many shops all along the coast. It is safe to swim there.
The main local beer is "Number One." It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to taste, but wines from New Zealand and Australia travel better.
The tap water there is drinkable, but bottled water can be found anywhere if you do not trust it too much.
For Australians, coffee called a "flat white" is foreign. They call plain coffee "espresso," cappuccinos have cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards. The juices are expensive but excellent.
Excursions to the islands are conducted throughout the year, and injuries related to these activities are not at all common.
However, follow the authorities' measures, heed the signs, and pay close attention to safety measures.
Cubozoa is found on beaches and in river estuaries between October and April in the north of 1770. They can also be found outside that area during that season.
There are sharks, but it is not common for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to flee.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By having made a reservation in advance, the traveler will be more at ease knowing they have a place to sleep upon arrival.
Travel agents tend to have deals with specific hotels, but you can use their services to find other types of accommodations; for instance, camping areas.
Travel agents usually offer deals that combine breakfast, transportation to or from the airport, or the flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or prepare documentation (for example, a visa) for the trip.
Changes or requests must be made through the travel agent, not by contacting the hotel directly.
In the case of some festivals, most of the participants in music festivals decide to camp there, and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the activities, you will have to go early to find a place to camp near the area where the music is.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, music can continue to be played late into the night in other areas of the festival.
Some festivals have areas that families with children can use for camping.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic in the winter, check the cabin's location because crossing the ice creates a tremendous noise for those who are most impacted.
The cruises in St. Petersburg also provide the opportunity to spend time in the city. Cruise ship passengers do not have visa-related requirements (check specifications).
Casinos make a great effort to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are not easy to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered on the house. However, drunkenness and sensibility do not go hand in hand, and good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Those who intend to drive through high latitudes or mountains should take into account that there may be snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
On roads that are frozen or snow-covered, there is very little friction, and driving is not possible as it is on asphalt.
When there is a blizzard, it can snow enough to get stuck.
There may be reduced visibility due to snow or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, frosts and snowfalls are common in many countries, and traffic is normally not interrupted throughout the year.
African safaris are the main attraction for tourists and an unforgettable moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term safari specifically refers to a journey to see the wildlife living in the African savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, approach cars, and a good view can be obtained using standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and panthers are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
In pedestrian safaris (also called “bush walks,” “walking safaris,” or “hikes”), one walks for a few hours or so.
The Paralympic Games will be held between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics. It organized the games in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before announcing the delay, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation guidelines may change, but until March, cancellations due to the coronavirus will not be extended until July 2020, which is precisely when the Olympics are to be held.
Tickets for the event are expected to cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with regular tickets around 7,000 ¥.
Clothes that are ironed while wet will dry faster. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you do not like using ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer as an option, if there is one.
Do not overheat the fabric (it can shrink the clothing or, in the worst case, it can burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective than others regarding specific risks.
In some places, it is enough to boil water for one minute; in other places, several minutes are needed.
Some filters are more effective than others, and if you are concerned, we recommend buying a sealed water bottle from a major company.
Travelers can encounter pests of animals that they do not know in their hometown.
These pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases trigger an allergic reaction, as well as spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through violence are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is a good opportunity to buy tax and fee-free products in certain places.
Travelers from countries with high taxes can save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult part of driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway and often has to pass through very isolated remote locations.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be patient: steep sections, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are predominant.
The speed limits on the signs are significantly lower than those in the previous sections. It is usually 35-40 mph, 56-64 km/h, and it is very important to follow them.
Strangely, there is more coverage there than at other points on the road, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are very sweet, and those from Bavaria are rich and diverse, similar to their neighbors to the south in Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, and apples are used in pastries throughout the year; however, in summer, cherries and plums are used.
Many German sweets contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Famous cakes are particularly well-suited to enjoy with a cup of coffee.
If you want small but rich cakes, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is based on herbs and spices and is combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet," depending on the quantity of liquid.
In Northern India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is widely used to make curry. In Southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, they use coconut milk.
There are 17,000 islands in Indonesia, and the term Indonesian gastronomy includes the cuisine of many regions.
Nevertheless, without any other classifier, the term usually refers to the food of central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is available throughout the archipelago today and includes a variety of simply prepared meals. Indeed, the flavor preferences of the Javanese people are for peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the support for the rider and hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with great stability, but there may be risks related to safety because the rider can get trapped.
If a rider falls off the horse but one of their legs gets stuck in the stirrup, the horse could drag them along if it runs away. To reduce the risk, some safety measures should be taken.
First, most riders wear boots with heels, which have a smooth and wide sole.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English-style ones, have safety bars which allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if the rider falls and is pushed backward.
Cochamó Valley: It is a major climbing destination in Chile and is known as the Yosemite of South America; moreover, it has large granite walls and numerous rocks.
The views from the summits are incredible. Many climbers from around the world are opening new routes on these walls of endless possibilities.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered slopes with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an activity with many enthusiasts, which also includes traveling. These enthusiasts are often called "ski travelers," as they organize their vacations around skiing in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is very old. Images of skiers can be found in caves, dating back to 5,000 B.C.!
Downhill skiing originated in the 17th century at the earliest, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first leisure skiing club in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also referred to as ski hiking.
It is related, but has nothing to do with Alpine-style skiing because it takes place on slopes and requires stronger skis and boots.
Imagine sketching routes similar to those for walking.
Under these conditions, you will cover a greater distance than you would on foot, but only a few will manage to reach the speed of those who ski mountaineering without a backpack and on prepared trails.
Europe is a rather small continent, but it has many independent countries. In a typical scenario, visas would need to be requested to travel to various countries and security checks would have to be crossed multiple times.
On the contrary, the Schengen area functions like a single country in that respect.
While you are within that area, you can cross borders without having to go through controls where passports are checked.
Moreover, if you have a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for a visa to enter each of the countries that are members of the Schengen area, and thus you will save time and money and avoid having to fill out documents.
There is no global definition to specify which handcrafted products are considered antiques. Tax agencies define assets that are over 100 years old as antiques.
Definitions have geographical variable elements; the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products may be considered antiquities, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is a very important support for the Sámi, and the culture around treatment is also important in other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sámi people were involved in the mass breeding of reindeer; on the contrary, they lived by fishing, hunting, or similar activities, and used reindeer mainly as animals for transportation.
Nowadays, many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romani, the word "Gypsy" is sometimes considered an insult because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If it is indicated that the country you are going to visit is not safe to travel to, this may affect the health insurance for travelers or the insurance for trip cancellations.
We also recommend checking the governments' recommendations, but their advice is aimed at local residents.
For example, it is possible that Americans, Europeans, or Arabs in the Middle East may experience different situations.
Traffic advisories are nothing but a summary of the political situation in each country.
The perspectives given tend to be superficial, general, and overly simple compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term used to define dangerous meteorological phenomena that can cause damage, significant social disruptions, or death.
Severe weather can occur anywhere, and there are many types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and uncontrolled fires are some examples and consequences of severe weather, as well as electrical storms, tornadoes, whirlwinds, and cyclones.
Among the severe weather conditions depending on the region and season are hurricanes, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the risks of severe weather that may affect their region, as it can impact their travel plans.
Anyone who wishes to visit countries considered as war zones is advised to receive professional training.

The courses last between 2-5 days and involve role-plays, numerous first aid activities, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in nature are common, but there are very few publications about battlefields.
Passengers who wish to undergo sex reassignment surgery must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The desire to create non-gender-specific (X) identity documents or updated documents that match the desired name varies from one government to another.
The tendency to accept these documents also varies in foreign governments.
Since September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have become much stricter.
Before receiving surgery, transgender individuals cannot expect to pass through scanners without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the return currents of waves. On the beach, they are often created by waves that break on a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return current accumulates in the deeper sections and there a fast current for deep water is created.
Most deaths are the result of the fatigue caused by trying to swim against the current; indeed, it is impossible to swim out of it.
As soon as you get out of the current, it will not be harder than usual for you to swim to the shore.
Try to hold onto something somewhere so that the current doesn't catch you again, either according to your skill or if someone has seen you, wait until you receive help.
The shock of return hits sooner than cultural shock (it has less of the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily immersed themselves in another culture sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their original culture.
After living abroad and returning home, you have adapted to another culture and lost some of the traditions of your home culture.
At first, when you went abroad, surely people were patient and understanding, knowing that a person coming from another country has to adapt.
People may not foresee that travelers returning home also need patience and mutual understanding.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in that area.
The pyramids can be seen at night, and you can see them silently before the show begins.
Normally, the noise of tourists and vendors is always heard. The atmosphere created by the sounds and lights is like a story.
The sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and host the most bases; in fact, in 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km from the peninsula. King George Island is the largest, and Villa Las Estrellas settlement is located there.
There are also others, such as Livingston Island and Deception, where the outflows from an active volcano's crater have formed a wonderful natural harbor.
Ellsworth is a region located in the south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
There, the peninsula's mountains merge with the plateau and reappear to form the 360 km Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern parts or the Sentinel Range contain the highest mountains in Antarctica, namely the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson, at 4,892 meters.
In remote locations without coverage, a satellite phone will be your only option.
Satellite phones are not a common alternative to mobile phones, as they require being outdoors to make calls, within the satellite's clear line of sight.
This service is typically used by ships and leisure vessels, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
The local telephone service provider can provide you with more information to connect to that service.
Among those planning to take a sabbatical year, traveling and learning are becoming increasingly common.
This option is especially popular among those who have finished high school, as it offers them the opportunity to take a gap year before starting university without interrupting their studies.
In many cases, if you participate in a course abroad during your sabbatical year, your chances of entering higher education in your hometown increase.
Remember that you will have to pay a registration fee to enroll in those educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, small boats or kayaks offer different experiences.
Navigation is the most common recreational activity in Finland, and therefore there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
The same happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is a fairly significant amount (for example, in the Netherlands, the proportion is one in forty people).
Most Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Thanks to that, you have a couple of days available to visit the historic city, and at night return to the ship to sleep.
If you only use boat trips to go ashore, you will not need another visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures list Berlin (Germany). As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the trip to visit the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be frightening for people of any age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
That's not a reason to be ashamed: many people have personal fears or disgusts that are not different.
Understanding something about the operation of airplanes and what happens during flights can help some people cope with fear based on something unknown or out of control.
Air mail companies are well paid for sending things quickly. Often, time is very important in the case of business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, big companies have their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had issues with these matters.
If they send products by air transport, on some routes it takes several days to unload the products and clear customs.
Sending products as checked luggage was the only way to speed up the process. However, airlines do not allow luggage to be sent without passengers, and this might be an opportunity you can take advantage of.
Without a doubt, the clearest way to travel in business or first class is to pay a large sum of money (or, even better, to have your company pay the amount) to have that privilege.
However, that option does not come cheap: normally, a business-class flight is four times more expensive than an economy rate and, in the case of first class, eleven times more expensive!
Generally, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from one destination to another.
Airline companies know all too well that there is a group of travelers willing to pay high prices in order to get anywhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge according to that privilege.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. Romanian is the local language, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from inter-ethnic conflict.
As a result of that conflict, the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria was established in 1994 in the east of Moldova. It has its own government and currency, but they are not recognized by UN member countries.
The economic connections between the two regions of Moldova have been restored despite the political negotiations having failed.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion of Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with around 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very suitable transportation hub.
Once upon a time this city was ancient Smyrna, but now it is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial area, located around a giant bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and commercial centers have traditional red tiles on their roofs, as do the 18th-century market, mosques, and old churches, even though the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.

Do not disfigure the area by making marks or drawings on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately, half of them prefer to speak in Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are written in Catalan, as Catalan is the first official language established by law.
But Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
Regular metro announcements are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are communicated by an automated system in various languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although it is often a stereotype without any precision, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like "bien élevé" people (well-mannered). Moving from one place to another will be much easier this way.
The rigid exterior of the people from Paris will quickly disappear if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is full of forests, particularly beech and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a diverse and notable plant community, thanks to the range of microclimates, different soil types, and various altitude levels.
A wide variety of animal and bird species also live in that area.
Unusual fauna can be found there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, and capercaillie, as well as more common species.
To visit monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide wraps for women who did not come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it has bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Likewise, men must wear trousers above the knee.
That too can be taken from the entrance supplies, but since they don't wash that clothing after a person uses it, you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size only for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, similar to that of other Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in all dishes.

It can be said that reading makes it easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because one needs to know whether the verb or adjective is being used in noun forms.
It's quite easy to pronounce Italian, since most words are pronounced the way they are written.
You need to be especially careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure that you do not pronounce 'r' and 'rr' the same way: caro means dear, but carro means cart.
The grammar of Persian is somewhat easy and generally regular.
Therefore, thanks to this basic guide to grammar, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand expressions better.

Observatories from before the modern era are outdated today and are used as museums or educational sites.
In ancient times, as light pollution was not a problem, they tended to be located in cities or campuses because it was easier to reach them compared to those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous installations located in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing the blooming of cherry trees, known as hanami, began in Japanese culture in the 8th century.
The concept had its origin in China, where plum blossoms were the most favored.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor for himself and for other members of the aristocracy surrounding the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in their natural environment; therefore, resist the temptation to remove a “single specimen.”
Moreover, if you are visiting a formally organized garden and you collect "seeds," they will undoubtedly throw you out of there.
Singapore is generally an incredibly safe place, it's very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But if you are located in the "high tropics," a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to endure heat (always) and intense sunlight (when it is clear, less often).
There are also some buses going to Hebron, which is in the north; there, you will find the traditional graves of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated to commemorate the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions related to holidays have been adopted by those who are not believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
One of the traditions consists of spending the night of Easter awake, in the open air, to watch the dawn.
There are Christian theological explanations for that tradition, of course, but it could also have been a spring and fertility ritual from a time before Christianity.
More traditional churches hold the Easter vigil on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, and at midnight the churchgoers usually begin the celebration to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
At first, all the animals that arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make that journey, and the giant tortoise was the first land animal of the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day.
Since those areas have a very sparse population and light pollution is not an issue, you will also have the opportunity to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Western people are accustomed to.
Suits are the standard work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, and instead of praising individual achievements, they emphasize team effort.
Often, before making any decision, employees need the approval of their superiors, and they have to obey the instructions of their superiors without saying a word.
