USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic community to strive to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC stated, namely that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by bringing about significant change within our organization, and not through decertification.
USA Gymnastics has launched an independent investigation to understand how abuse of the scale so courageously described by those who survived Larry Nassar could have remained hidden for so long, and it is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive, and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely spread, but provides greater details compared to fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to what scientists state, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloring on the lower part.
The discovery also allows for obtaining detailed information regarding the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage does not have the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other typical feather characteristics, such as barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. Researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than chick down.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals plumage of an adult specimen and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and injuring more than twenty people.

The brightness is used together with the rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the lesser the star's activity in relation to magnetic reversals.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys conducted of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was supposed to be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attractive force on Earth that generates the tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory posits that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, due to the high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe inside the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital itself.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can end up infecting between 10 and 15 close contacts.
Nonetheless, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people affected by tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected people at a given time in South Africa.

Glen Cushing from the team of astrogeologists at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, stated: "Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and place in an envelope a pre-printed sheet indicating their chosen candidate.
After the verification of their identity by officials, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral law encodes the procedures quite rigorously.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that at the start of voting there are no envelopes present and that no others are inserted except those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send their representatives to attend every phase of the process. In the evening, the volunteers carry out the vote count under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

The bill stipulates that violent video games sold in the State of California must have a label with "18" written on it and makes the sale to minors punishable with a fine of $1,000 per violation.
This morning the public prosecutor, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement that both Huhne and Pryce will be charged.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the government by Ed Davey MP. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will fill the role of Minister for Business left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Magistrates' Court is scheduled for February 16.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will need to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not fire when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider is in constant pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a section of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo took part in two individual races of the Championships.
First in the slalom, where in the first run she recorded a DNF. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the event.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's "sitting" category group, with a combined run time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place finisher, Austria's Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place finisher, Hungary's GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the women's group were unable to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police managed to recover the laptop and the cellphone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that moment, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh sheriff court charged with killing her own son.
She is being held pending indictment and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has different criteria. The Scottish courts have indeed deemed the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspects are walking on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, informed journalists that no new comments will be released at least until the formal charge is made.
According to what has been leaked, the document will focus on the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to relinquish such a presence only for five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for pest animal control had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, as the experiment was being overseen and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four snipers selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country toward new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission constituted Martelly's response to widespread protests, which began in October, contesting the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which have caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it is aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "non-serious."
In its response, the ministry called the postponement of the report by Apple "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake tremor in the Marianas was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the nation.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami occurring.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took hostages of Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After receiving training in midwifery, in 1959 she started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time, Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His/Her research showed that the administration of a hormone would have accelerated the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight recordings.

Tommy Dreamer declared: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was quirky like meâ€¦ Maybe even moreâ€¦ I love her and I will miss herâ€¦ Let's hope she's in a better place," commented Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey conducted on 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, the people opposed to Australia transitioning to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the interim prime minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of survey participants, who believe Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the opposite ends of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% are of the opinion that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but suffered from various ailments that cast doubt on their physical condition.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, meaning the matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and in particular how Earth was formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office as governor since the beginning of this year; last month he signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
According to him, the speculations are nothing more than "political chatter and nonsense."
A candidacy for the presidency in 2016 is hypothesized.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system employs satellite technology instead of the outdated ground-based radar system to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport services are being set up, and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while no car parking or park-and-ride facilities are available on site.
Concerns related to the lack of transportation options have raised the possibility of having to hold the match behind closed doors, without the support of the teamâ€™s fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds has reportedly emerged on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much longer; this was due to the mating between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any type of shape. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be drawn out to form a thin thread, suitable for being twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of the ability to be made so thin.
It concerns the so-called pH of the substance. By using red cabbage juice, it is possible to construct a pH indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color based on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical substance is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H in pH).
By hydrogen ions, we mean protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, shape them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on one's hands and the outer layers, a reaction will trigger that causes a strange sensation and forms a sort of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remnants of sewer systems have been discovered in the residential buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, they were sometimes included in public baths, frequented by a mixed crowd of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and the view.
To transport a satellite or a telescope into space, a rocket more than 100 feet tall is necessary.
The wheel has enormously changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile, and several other means of transport made their appearance.
Below them, there are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-roaming domestic cats) that feed on small prey, significantly more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche constitutes the secret of their success, a particular objective that each feline has that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach up to 30.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pride of lions behaves very much like a pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is indeed surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), even as far as deadly attacks on their prey are concerned.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not too well), swim, make very long jumps, and exert a pulling strength five times that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it resembles more a phrase of shouted and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment before pouncing on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thereby making a possible return difficult), it will likely find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations compared to those required previously.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
As time goes by and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At a certain point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by them (through exhalation).
Plants produce their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses starting from plants and make our clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its era and therefore feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws emerged more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed its path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is also possible that he was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex could not have competed with it.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also included various strange or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on chairs, rich men loved to feast together lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Naturally, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
A large part of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas, it is told that it was Erik the Red who gave it the name, having come across Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Even though they are all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" is found. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Despite it not being known for certain who wrote it, it is well known that at the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was added only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was named "Operation Dragoon".
The American forces and those of the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
By civilization, we mean a specific culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", meaning citizen, and "civitas", meaning city or city-state, and in a certain way therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
City-states are the first entities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural mark through equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and thus are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was its only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, for the implementation of its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass the tax laws and duties between the states.
To amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all the states was necessary. For their part, these states had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, rink hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more widely practiced in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Almost 7,000 islands are part of Japan (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago," given the presence of groups of islands that compose it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through there shortly thereafter recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwest part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation that affected the grain production systems of the aborigines and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
A large part of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most used film at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many standard formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
In this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a bond among European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
His omnipresent power influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary reserves of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been upheld.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy turned out to be effective: it involved the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite this blockade violating international law generally accepted and codified by multiple international treaties over the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to block access for any vessel to entire sections of the ocean, also putting neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its campaign of indiscriminate submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City, and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: every period of China or every ruling family constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division among the provinces. The most well-known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, among many nobles fighting for the throne, fierce wars broke out.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous; among them, one can cite the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to a republic, nationalism, and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad harbored a deep interest in matters beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers a very clear picture of the spirituality of Muhammad in itself.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not at all easy to find, even if its existence is known. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing else can be seen but a wonderful clear sky and a great number of mountains all around. From inside the cave, very little of the surrounding world can be seen or heard.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one to have reached us not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the grand pyramidal structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Khufu), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "arch up" symbol resembles a V and the "arch down" symbol resembles a paper clip or a square without the bottom side.
Upward means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means you should start from the frog (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow toward yourself.
An ascending bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow results in a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can choose to add your personalized annotations in pencil, but keep in mind that the printed markings you find have a musical significance, so as a rule they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At a certain point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The costs of the US imperialism's war efforts to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people were the profits underpinning American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice includes a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative in the strict sense according to which the destiny of man is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
A large part of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can assert that the automobile necessarily entails the development of the road network.
However, a national road network only for a few cars is not economically sustainable, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, drawing from authors like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography has influenced individuals, and over time, customs, traditions, and culture have arisen linked to that geography, which, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its prestige diminished, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was reached between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of the communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era, resulting from the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually of an organic type, that uses preserved seeds native to the ecological region in conjunction with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing yields.
Historically, a large part of the farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still the case.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, social class, position, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical in nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, as a result of misfortunes, or as a result of intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been isolated by people (often their own parents): in certain cases, the abandonment is motivated by the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children might have been raised by animals; still, others seem to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When the feral child is completely raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather a support for those embarking on a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the small paperclip assistant from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to query, prompt, and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, or even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide them with nourishment, care, and education, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care represents a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to meet all the unmet needs from the home they were taken from.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships."
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
He even claims that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, new genetic variability is added; with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of human beings, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savanna.
Moreover, the failure to carry out such activities has severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs), are not only easy to digest but also provide a high amount of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it shouldn't be surprising that our own ancestors resolved their "protein problem" in a certain sense in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleeping period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10â€“60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness without waking you up completely.
Should you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm include consuming plenty of liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force one to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace in proportion to the opposite of the tension existing in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force is. Each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hindered only by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
Generally speaking, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focal point of Tibetan meditation. Through the depiction of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts caused the rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies; thus began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and would actually be fought by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, immediately proved obsolete when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of navies has always been to ensure that the country can safeguard its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples supporting this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be raised by ancient cultures and tribes to have easy access to milk, fleece, meat, and hide.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds allowed to roam freely on the hills or in other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These herding methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century in England, wagonways were constructed.
Despite being formed simply by parallel wooden planks, wagonways, when compared to the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed the horses traveling on them to achieve higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused increased wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails appeared.
The first means of transportation that humans knew were their legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering to some extent, we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, join the environmental movement, and even engage in activism.
In many cases, this works only as a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, while problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printer John Dunlap a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, today known as "The Dunlap Broadsides".
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of the feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that they share with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is at the core of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in technical computer language, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of an open container of medication or harmful chemicals.
Check if there are specific first aid instructions on the label for that particular poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bedbugs, insects that have strongly adapted to becoming parasites of humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for approximately 400,000 known cases, making it the leading neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research has highlighted that the likelihood of developing MS among females is double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, given that an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also allow the orientation of scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Latin version of the Bible.
The opinions of Aristotle on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend significantly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not merely reactions to external periodic signals, in relation to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, that is viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns to drive to work, passing by other people whose place of work is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic hustle and bustle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which they also support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses the transportation systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Is it the engineers who design them that are incompetent, or are there deeper reasons?
"Traffic Flow" (i.e., "traffic flow") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably consistent range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to display reasonable consistency and can be generally represented mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables have been correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing, and managing road infrastructures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly allowed them to escape from enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
A large part of insects is advantaged by the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Among all the insects existing today, the only ones that are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
For some, he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that is, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and the second-longest river on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the total water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. The waters of thousands of smaller tributaries flow into it.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted, admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the least population.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to learn about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper as far back as antiquity: these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These actually resemble more the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of minimal quantities of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to an inferior status and is used less and less frequently.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis for the functioning of the fission bomb.
In practice, it's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Then, by further splitting the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearer side and 100 km on the farther side.
It is thinner beneath the seas and thicker beneath mountainous areas.
The maria might be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This has made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Theories about content focus on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites certain people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what context factors in which they live prompt them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it complicated to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the other extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels the need to change the entire team's work and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is analogous to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy compared to members of conventional teams, as meetings may occur according to various time zones, which might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
A "silent team" is defined as the management team that each member refers to and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the willingness to undertake the long process that leads to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement the concepts of organizational learning could be innovation.
When all the available resources are effectively utilized across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
For an organization to be considered innovative, it is necessary for the leaders to foster a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of the continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The area of research becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.

It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never previously observed.
This provides us with a large amount of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is often used today in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips represent a fundamental part of teaching. Often, teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are marked by poor grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author strives to improve the writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to sustain the audience's interest motivates students to be resourceful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students to become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within others' writings, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the picturesque and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, one can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, among these are some almost uninhabited wildernesses.
If a comparison of the population is made, the result may be surprising to many: in the United States, the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxurious beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands, the Arabs also brought Islam, which embarked on a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travelers: it is recommended that all declare themselves to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, later named Casablanca by the Spanish traders who chose these places for their trading bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a lot of trinkets, but all of this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying a large part of the city's streets, especially those in the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to do thorough research before planning any visits outside of Goma, in order to adequately assess the state of clashes that still persist in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as being one of the less expensive opportunities to see Africa's mountain gorillas.
It is possible to use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a consequence of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up becoming a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but due to its reputation, it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites that are in danger due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In the PBS special by Henry Louis Gates "Wonders of the African World," it was one of the main stops.
With its more Arabian than African touch, the city stands out distinctly from the others in the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, borders Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary is marked by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 kmÂ², the park encompasses 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As for all national parks in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and park entry.
Even purchasing a Wild Card could be useful, as it provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a sparkling bar chart, made even more evident by being framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon opposite.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on the reclaimed lands of the densely populated northern coast.
This is the place the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove area in the world. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest included in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: within them lies what remains of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 kmÂ², of which about one third consists of marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; the area is estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
The buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the buses servicing between different districts are often full, it would be wise to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and quick means to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
Its two pylons have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge, the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic only occurred in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints will likely be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the PayaguÃ¡, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards initiated a period that lasted three centuries, the era of colonization.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and indigenous characteristics.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year as well.
For information on tournaments and ticket purchases for polo matches, you should contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on the outlying islands they do not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures above 30Â°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the sensation of a temperature lower than that indicated by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's animals are accustomed to the sight of humans, the wildlife is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not maintaining an adequate distance. It is necessary to give these animals adequate space as they are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with very strong smells, and try to keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port occurred the sadly known naval standoff of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the paramount chief.
There are many beaches since Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches facing the Pacific Ocean on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide range of shops. You can swim safely.
The best-known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant, and refreshing beer called "Number One." The other local beer is called "Manta."
You can have many French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand ones might handle the journey better.
The tap water at the place is completely safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee originates from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is a short black coffee, the cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on the same level as the Belgian one. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions are carried out on the coral reef, and injuries from one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, adhere to the guidelines, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period, they are only occasionally found.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of them and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, as they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to/from the airport, or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any modifications or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial part of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, it is necessary to arrive early and secure a spot near the music.
Remember that once the music on the main stages is over, there might be sections of the festival where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the crossing of the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are more exposed to it.
The cruises to St. Petersburg include time dedicated to exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted a visa waiver (check the conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything they can to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. Typically, there are neither windows nor clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer food, drinks, and exclusive entertainment to keep the guests' spirits high and make sure they stay.
In some establishments, alcoholic beverages are on the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as you would on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you might get stuck.
Precipitation and snow flurries, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle's windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the centerpiece of many visitors' vacations.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to journeys conducted overland, particularly in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so regular equipment is sufficient to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, and for this reason, it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "on-foot safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations spread across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary between them, however most of the cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most event tickets is expected to range between Â¥2,500 and Â¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost approximately Â¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can make drying easier. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not available in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one available.
Be careful not to subject the fabrics to excessively high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water, and some of these prove to be more effective against specific risks.
In certain areas, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, therefore, in case of doubt, it is advisable to consider purchasing bottled water in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not prevalent in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritations or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that presents the most difficult driving conditions, as it often passes through isolated areas among the vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advised to keep your eyes wide open, as there are steep slopes, narrow lanes, and tight curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those applied in the preceding and following sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Strict compliance with them is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of mobile phone service coverage is much higher compared to that present in other stretches of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are somewhat tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are timeless classics, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked desserts also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who wish to taste small but flavorful sweets can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used for curries in inland regions; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specifications, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a range of easily prepared dishes; its predominant flavors come from the use of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can pose safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the runaway horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots equipped with a heel and a smooth and relatively thin sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially English ones, have incorporated safety bars, which ensure that a leather stirrup detaches from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
CochamÃ³ Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there is a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks of the summits include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continuously chart new routes on its potentially infinite walls.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding on the snow using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts numerous enthusiasts, sometimes even referred to as "ski bums" (those who are crazy about skiing), who devote entire vacation periods to skiing in a particular resort.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport originated at least in the 17th century; in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski trekking.
It is connected, even though it usually does not include them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a path similar to a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than those traveled by walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but is made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel across multiple countries, one would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, regarding this aspect, the Schengen area functions rather like a single country.
If you stay within this area, it is usually possible to go from one border to another without having to go through passport control again.
In the same way, if you have a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for visas for the individual member countries, thereby saving time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider an object to be such if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographical differences in terms of the age limit, which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Handcrafted objects might be classified as antiques, even if they are more recent compared to similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the SÃ¡mi, and the culture upon which this trade is based also underpins many other professions.
Even over time, not all SÃ¡mi were always involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Today, many SÃ¡mi hold modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in SÃ¡pmi, the territory of the SÃ¡mi.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Romani people, the word "zingaro" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a mistaken perception of Romani people.
If a travel advisory is issued for the destination you will visit, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
You might also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
To give an example, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The notices simply constitute a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The reported opinions are often superficial, generic, and simplistic compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to indicate any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
In every part of the world, extreme weather conditions can occur, and there are different types of them, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, above-normal precipitation, and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal high-intensity weather phenomena are blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as these may influence travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered as a war zone must undergo professional training.
Searching the Internet for 'Hostile Environment Course' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, as well as many first aid training activities and sometimes weapons training.
The books and magazines that deal with wilderness survival are widespread, while there are few publications that focus on war zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The intention by governments to issue passports without gender indications (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.

Security checks inspections have also become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative stage should not expect to pass through checks without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are made up of the backwash of waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the backflow concentrates in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from attempting to swim against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
As soon as you exit the current, swimming back will be no more difficult than usual.
Try to identify an area where you do not risk getting trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescue, based on your abilities and whether you have been spotted.
Re-entry shock occurs over a shorter period compared to culture shock (as there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readapting to the culture of their own country of origin.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your original culture.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were necessary even for those returning to their home country.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally, the noise made by tourists and vendors is always heard. The sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the highest number of bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of an active volcano filled with water forms a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, only to re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone because one must be outdoors with an unobstructed view to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including recreational ones, as well as by missions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information regarding the connection to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among recent graduates, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase the likelihood of resuming higher education upon returning to one's home country.
Usually, enrolling in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," there are also thousands of islands, both within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and the lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also occurs in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather unique fact (e.g. in the Netherlands, the ratio is one to forty).
A large part of the various Baltic cruises includes a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For disembarkation, a separate visa will not be necessary (starting from 2009) when using shore excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea; furthermore, the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can frighten people of all ages and from any background, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar from the fears and personal aversions that many people show towards other things.
For certain people, understanding a bit about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can prove useful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or on the fact of not having control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Timing is often very important in the case of business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to arrive faster would be to send it as checked baggage. And that's where you come in, since airline regulations do not allow baggage to be shipped without a passenger.
To fly in first class or business class the most obvious way is to shell out a nice sum for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
However, the price to pay is high: roughly, one can expect to shell out up to four times the normal economy fare for Business travel and up to eleven times the fare for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it's not even worth looking for discounts on first-class or business-class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and consequently they apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÈ™inÄƒu, and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that in the past was the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, equipped with its own government and its own currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million people; it is the second-largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna develops on a vast bay, is surrounded by mountains, and currently constitutes a modern, evolved, and active commercial center.
Although the atmosphere in the city is more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than to that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass faÃ§ades, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with characteristic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik, you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the enchanting village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb line 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a place of worship), a site of Marian apparitions renowned worldwide.
Remember that the site you are visiting is fundamentally a mass grave, and it holds an almost incalculable significance for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by marking or graffitiing the structures.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is practically known by everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transportation and other services.
In the subway, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unplanned service disruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians are reputed to be self-centered, rude, and presumptuous.
Even though it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to enjoy oneself in Paris continues to be by behaving well, interacting like a "bien Ã©levÃ©" (well-mannered) person. This will definitely make your movements easier.
The rough outward appearance of Parisians will quickly fade if you display some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly of beech, spruce, and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multitude of microclimates, different soils, and altitudinal levels, it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a very large variety of animal species and birds.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that extend below the knees.
These too can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts might make you feel uncomfortable. For men, one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a popular, simple dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato, and all available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form which stands for "Lei", always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is being used in a substantivized form makes the writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means beloved, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple grammar that is mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could greatly help you with Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if one already knows a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimal knowledge of the Spanish language may come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, premodern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not a problem like it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes intended for research are enormous structures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the blossoming of plum trees was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants thrive best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking some plant specimens will cost you being expelled from this place, without discussions.
In general, Singapore is a very safe city and easy to get around; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north, towards Hebron, the traditional site where the Bible's patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme around which to organize a vacation.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to visit the interesting cities along the Danube, or sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of well-known hiking trails and cycling paths.
Christmas represents one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition involves spending Easter night staying awake in an outdoor location in order to admire the sunrise.
Naturally, there are Christian theological explanations underlying this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches, an Easter vigil is often celebrated on the night of Saturday of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals could not make the journey. This led to the giant tortoise becoming the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to witness the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not an issue and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners tend to be accustomed to.
Office attire usually consists of a jacket and tie or a suit, and colleagues are addressed by their surname or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, as it values group commitment rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain approval from their superiors regarding every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
