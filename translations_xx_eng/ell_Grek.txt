This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and their three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the wings of this animal were brown on top with a light or carrot color on the bottom.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of plumage in birds.
Because the wings of dinosaurs do not possess a fully developed shaft, called a rachis, yet they do have other characteristics of feathers — barbs and barbules — researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flying but for regulating temperature or for display. Scientists argue that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not chick down.
The researchers claim that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen suggests adult plumage rather than that of a hatchling.
A car packed with explosives exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

Brightness and rotation are calculated together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The star is as inactive concerning magnetic reversals as the Rossby number is smaller.

The part of the project that was completed was primarily theoretical, however, the program was designed to represent observations for the Sagittarius galaxy.
What the team anticipated would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, creating tides, the Milky Way also exerts a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter found in a galaxy is located around the galaxy, forming a kind of halo, and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview he had given, he said that the new mutation "caused great concern due to the high mortality rate."
Dr. Mol believes that some patients may have been infected by the virus in the hospital and at least two of them belonged to the hospital's healthcare professionals.
Within the span of a year, a person who has been infected can transmit the infection to 10 to 15 close contacts.

Through the infrared images, it appears that the temperature fluctuations at night and during the day indicate that these are likely caves.
They are cooler during the day compared to the surrounding surface and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, yet it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have always been a low-tech experience: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper that indicates the candidate of their choice.
After the employees verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The process is codified with great strictness by the electoral law of France.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be visible in order for those voting and the witnesses to certify that there are no ballots at the start of the voting and that no additional ballots are added beyond those legally counted and the legitimate voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process. Late in the afternoon, the votes are counted by volunteers, under strict supervision, who follow specific procedures.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, announced this morning the prosecution of Huhne and Pryce.
Hyun resigned and will be replaced in the Cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over the position of Business Minister, which Davey is vacating.
Hyun and Price were scheduled to appear at the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old, who was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his hand and jaw, while Christopher Schneider ended up needing reconstructive surgery on his face.
Juka's gun misfired as it was aimed at a man's head. Schneider endures constant pain, blindness in one eye, loss of part of the skull, and facial reconstruction with titanium.
Schneider testified via live link from a U.S. Air Force base in his homeland.
Beyond Wednesday's competition, Karpeneto competed in two individual championship events.
Her first race was the Slalom, where she earned a "Did Not Finish" on her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors received the same result in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting ski category with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who finished first and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani who finished ninth.
Four skiers in the women's sitting skiing category were unable to complete their runs, while 45 of the total 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile and laptop."
The defendants are Baba Kandar, Bota Kandar, Rabro Kandar, Gaza Kandar, and Vishnu Kandar.
The police chief, Chandra Sekar Solanki, stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although 3 people were inside the house at the time of the car crash, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road of the accident was temporarily closed, while the emergency services were extracting the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he went to an Addenbrooke's clinic in Cambridge.
Antekoia has since been accused by the Supreme Court of Edinburgh of murdering her son.
He is in custody with charges pending and a trial upcoming, but any eyewitness testimony may have been influenced as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, however, justice in Scotland operates differently and the courts have ruled that publishing photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee states that "journalists seem to be walking a tightrope if they publish photos, etc. of the suspects."
The Prosecutor's Office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has informed the journalists that there will be no further comments at least until the charges are filed.
According to the leaked information, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine desires based on the borders before the Middle Eastern war that took place in 1967.
According to reports, among the other topics covered was the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both states, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian authority agrees to allow this type of presence for only five years.
The marksmen in the supplementary trial pest control would be under close supervision by the foresters, as the trial would be monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Shooting Federation of Australia (NSW), expert volunteers were recruited as part of the Shooting Federation's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, General Manager for the Maintenance and Heritage of Parks of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received thorough instructions for safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn into a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It is the fifth interim electoral council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the prior resignation of the Interim Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime demonstrations that began in October.
Some violent protests occurred due to the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
According to official reports, there have been about 60 cases of iPod malfunctions that resulted in high temperatures, starting six fire outbreaks and leaving four people with minor fire-related injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly unfortunate."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on Friday).
The emergency management office of the Mariana Islands stated that there were no reports of damage in their territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino who was a former policeman took Hong Kong visitors hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of his country.
Rolando Mendoza fired targeting the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least 6 deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six of the hostages, along with the children and the elderly, were released early; the same for the photographers who came from the Philippines.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained and became a gynecologist, and began working in 1959 at the state women's clinic in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his free time.
According to his research, if a hormone were given, the embryonic lung would mature.
Xinhua stated that government investigators on Wednesday located two flight data recorders known as "black boxes."
The fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Luna was the first winner of the Queen of Extreme contest. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Unique like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as bizarre as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people who participated in the poll before the 2010 federal elections, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The serving Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic without a monarch when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of those who participated in the survey agreed with this idea, because they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding the two extremes of the poll, 29% of the total respondents believe that Australia should become a republic without a monarchy as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic without a monarchy.
The gold Olympian was expected to participate in the 100 meters and the 200 meters freestyle swimming and in three swimming relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his discomfort, his physical condition is being questioned.
He could not receive the medication needed to avoid pain because it is banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number found to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water transport to Earth as well as organic matter which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for presidency in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration claims that the next-generation air transportation system would allow aircraft to conduct shorter routes, save gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite-based—in contrast to the older ground-based technology reliant on radar—to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint an aircraft more accurately and provide more precise information to pilots.
There is no additional transport and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parks and park and ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raise the possibility that the match may necessarily be held behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study shared on Thursday in Science spoke about the existence of a new type of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though the process is believed to have taken much longer, due to the interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch of the genus Geospiza fortes and the migratory finch of the genus Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be crafted into all shapes. It can be formed into shapes of minimal size.
It can be sculpted into thin wire, and then bent and woven. It can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can become very thin and stick to other metals. It can become so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in handmade book images called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using juice from red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being examined.
Hydrogen ions are protons which no longer have their electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Rotate the two dry powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, press them to form a ball.
The moisture on your palms will react with the outer shells, which will create a strange sensation and will form something like a peel.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet for each house, which was connected to an advanced drainage system.
Also, in Greece, in the residences of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, ruins of drainage systems have been found.
Toilets also appeared in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Rome, toilets were often part of public baths, where everyone, regardless of gender, formed a mixed crowd.
When you call someone who is very far away, you use a satellite.
The satellite located in space receives the call and then sends it back to Earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Experts have space telescopes because the atmosphere of our planet causes distortions in light and our visibility.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The contribution of the wheel to the world is astonishing. Above all, the most important is the simpler and faster movement.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars, and many other transportation machines.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey from hares to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, there are many predators of kittens (including pet cats that are left free) that hunt the many insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of position, a special role that each cat has, which prevents competition among them.
Lions are the most social felines, as they live in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three adult males that are related to each other along with up to thirty females with their young.
Females usually have a close connection with each other, as they constitute a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act largely like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that behave surprisingly like lions (but not other big cats), and are also highly deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a complete athlete, can climb (not very well), swim, make huge leaps, and exert five times more power than a strong human to lift something.
The tiger belongs to the same category (Panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but rather resembles a phrase of angry, shouted words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to hunt for food by using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground to locate them.
They see very well in the dark through night vision and move silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by adapting to their environment and then launching a sudden attack on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often encounter a different environment than in the past.
This new environment has new resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was required in the past.
The indigenous inhabitants have not changed at all, the same adjustments as in the past need to be made.
As time goes by, as the new population begins to adjust to the new environment, the similarity with the rest of the population gradually decreases.
At some point, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, release through breathing).
Plants create their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made from plants. The foods we eat are mostly plants. Without plants, the survival of animals would be impossible.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws possessed over 70 razor-sharp teeth, combined with an additional row of teeth at the top of its mouth, indicating that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might have been a cannibal.
It launched attacks on anything that entered the water. Even the giant dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus, would not have been a match for it.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans also had various strange or unusual festive dishes, including the following: wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference lies in the fact that the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs, while wealthy men preferred to eat at banquets where they could recline on their side while dining.
Meals in ancient Rome could not contain foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the subsequent centuries.
For example, there was no corn, tomato, potato, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built for each one of their gods a primary temple that was considered the god's dwelling.
People would dedicate sacrifices to the deities, and the priesthood would attempt to fulfill the deities' wishes by organizing mysteries and celebrations.
In every temple, there is an open courtyard and then an inner sanctum to which only the priests have access.
Sometimes specific towers were built in a pyramidal shape called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the roof was not so important.
The Jewish family spent the majority of their life in the countryside.
The women were cooking in the courtyard, while the shops were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used as a building material.
The land of Canaan did not have large forested areas, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Scandinavian saga mentions that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, as he traveled westward, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, despite his discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed greatly.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might believe that on the back of the Declaration of Independence, there is a treasure map written.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back side of the Declaration of Independence, the following was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." This is written below, in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the annotation might have been added simply as a remark.
The landing in Normandy and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the South was still not free.
It was governed by the Vichy Government. It consisted of French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; this raid was called Operation "Dragon."
Within two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and Germany was next.
Culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization (πολιτισμός) derives from the Latin civilis, meaning civil (πολιτικός), which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this indeed somewhat describes the scale of society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. A cultural culture implies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, in a continuous cultural footprint and an exquisite dissemination.
Smaller cultures are often lost without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as regular civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government - with Congress being the only component - based on the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were uncooperative, for the enforcement of all laws.
Additionally, he had no authority to overlook the tax legislation and duties between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so lightly that often their representatives were absent.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams worldwide and were in fact the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern countries, with Italians participating in international competitions and in the Olympic Games events.
In Japan, there are nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island on the planet!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, the latter is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan's origins date back to the past, the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and initiated a transformation in the practices by which native grains were cultivated, employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern parts of Taiwan, making it an administrative region of their empire in 1885.
After losing in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1985), the Qing Dynasty subsequently signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where Taiwan was ceded to the Japanese until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been built from scratch in order to give tourists a better idea of what their original appearance was like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common form of still image photography is 35 mm worldwide, which was the prevalent film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but the most important thing is the aspect ratio that has been inherited from the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide, which causes confusion, and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this configuration (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format category, for example) are equal to or closely approach these image ratios.
The rule of three, which is often subject to misuse and mockery, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while simultaneously maintaining order to a certain extent in an image.
He states that the most effective point for the main subject is located at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which now possessed wealth and power, was subjected to scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has forged unbreakable bonds among European countries despite any differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power influenced everyone, from kings to common mortals.
One of the main beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to relieve the poor and those who suffer, and the financial funds of the churches are collected specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the doctrine was being implemented correctly.
Great Britain began to block Germany from the sea immediately after the start of the attacks.
The strategy proved effective, as there were cuts in vital military and political supplies, despite the fact that the embargo in question violated the generally accepted international law, which has been codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom placed mines in international waters with the aim of obstructing the movement of ships in every part of the sea, even threatening neutral ships.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected the same for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the stance adopted by most citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
The states, having witnessed the horror and atrocities of war during World War I, wanted to avoid the repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a job position at the Edison company.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing each distinct time period. Each stage of China or each ruling family constituted a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was that of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, a fierce war raged among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne of the grand palace in Xi'an.
The social and political consequences are numerous and among them is the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to democratization, patriotism, and the belief that the country does not belong to a single ruler, but to all the people.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were accessible to all male job applicants, giving the opportunity to the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applied to the army, as instead of enlisting based on category, it now occurred based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed individuals of the working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Mohammed was intensely interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, having survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave is far from the world as it is located on the edge of a hill north of Mecca.
In reality, it is not at all easy for someone to find it even if they are aware of its existence. Once you enter the cave, you find yourself in complete isolation.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very few things of this world are visible or can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, which was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many large pyramid-shaped structures constructed in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" which is located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has various pyramids (the largest of which is the pyramid of Khufu), several small tombs, numerous temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, as well as the smaller tombs and temples, were built in honor of Cheops' wife and family members.
The symbol indicating that the bow should move upwards resembles a V, and the symbol indicating downward movement looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Up-bow means you must start at the tip, pushing the bow, and down-bow means you must start at the frog (the point where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upward bow stroke produces a softer sound, while the downward stroke is stronger and more dynamic.
You are free to place your own marks, but please keep in mind that those which exist serve a certain musical function, therefore they often need to be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, who were terrified, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were yelling and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At some point, a person from the crowd began brandishing the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen's eyes.
The expenses of the imperialistic war of the United States for the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA to cover a large portion of the expenses, and the interest rate on the bonds was promoted on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Certainly, the excess profits that resulted from the long-term exploitation of the people of the Philippines were meant to constitute the core earnings of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must perceive the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era during which the events occurred is often referred to as the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to conditions, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the promotion or imposition of technology to the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly connected with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two central ideas: that the development of technology in itself follows a path largely removed from cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn exerts an "influence" on societies of intrinsic character, rather than on societies adapted to the present.
For example, one might argue that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed with the aim of reducing car ownership costs.
The regime of mass ownership also leads to higher rates of traffic accidents, which in turn lead to new methods in healthcare for the recovery of bodily injuries.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, which originated from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultural elements arose in connection with this geography, which, being in harmony with the position of society, were better than laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is considered a source of style in the modern era, so was Constantinople the corresponding European source during feudalism.
His reputation as the center of abundance began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its prestige diminished in the twelfth century, mainly because of the crusaders who brought back materials such as silk and spices, which had higher value than the products from the markets of Byzantium.
That was when the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, the slow communication channels entailed delays of 25 to 30 years in style in the West.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the significant developments of the era, which resulted from the Crusades, was that people began to fasten their clothes with buttons.
Subsistence farming is the type of agriculture that takes place to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic system that uses stored seeds sourced from the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotations or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield.
Traditionally, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar views, who feel marginalized by social norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are divided based on criteria such as the age of the member, their origin, their social class, where they are located, and/or racial discrimination.
The characteristics of a subculture that make it distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
To signify their identity, members of a subculture often adopt a characteristic and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, distinctive behaviors, and slang.
A primary technique for understanding the meaning of socialization is to rely on the rare unfortunate incidents of children who, due to neglect, bad luck, or mistreatment, did not interact with adults during their lives.
Such children are called "wildlings" or wild. Some wild children have been isolated by people, usually their own parents. In some cases, this child's abandonment was due to being rejected by its parents because of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children are likely to have experienced severe abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or running away.
For some, it is said that they were raised by animals; for others, it is speculated that they lived alone in the wild.
A wild child, when raised entirely by animals without any contact with humans, exhibits behaviors (within natural limits) that almost perfectly resemble those of the specific animal that cared for it, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, aids take it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning but rather a helping hand for people undergoing a new teaching experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual and real scaffolds; in other words, the teacher constitutes a form of scaffolding, but the same applies to the paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aids are integrated into the software and are intended to inquire, promote, and explain processes whose handling might have been very difficult for students.
Children are placed under the care of foster parents for various reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment without care, love, and education, but it happens.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
The foster care system we have is considered to provide safe homes, caring individuals who offer care, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that the child was not receiving at the home from which they were removed.
The internet includes elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet result in the existence of additional dimensions regarding the approach to uses and gratifications.
For instance, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivations for someone to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) during their investigation of audience reactions to websites.
Videotaping has helped with significant findings in understanding micro-expressions, that is, our expressions which last for a tiny fraction of a second.
Specifically, it is said that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his dissertation titled "The President's Speech," mentions that individuals who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, nevertheless, able to discern sincerity with accuracy.
It is further considered that these abilities in understanding human behavior are also exhibited in animals such as domesticated dogs.
A twentieth-century study showed that there are two forms of genetic diversity, latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Discrimination and mixing redistribute diversity between the 2 sides in each family.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to satisfy its need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Moreover, their failure in this particular case had serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be proteins that can adhere to leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest by primates like us, unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, the animal feeds (ants, termites, eggs) are not only digestible but also important sources of protein that contain all the essential amino acids.
Taking all the data into account, it doesn't surprise us that our ancestors faced the "protein issue" just as chimpanzees do on the savanna at this moment.
Sleep interruption is the process by which you consciously wake up during the regular period that your sleep lasts and then fall asleep again after a short while (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so you can gain your senses without fully waking up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock while you are asleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so you have to get up to deactivate it.
Other options based on the biorhythm include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties) before bed, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and mind.
The less pressure there is, the better the vital force that is present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and pleasure.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacles to this goal are the tension and negativity within each of us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, in principle, is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everything.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini (enlightening) energy awakens due to movements, breathing practices, mantras, and visualizations.
The focal point of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the conflicts at the level of system, processes, and culture led the two countries to a rupture.
As two years had passed since the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the beginning of the Cold War had begun.
It would last for 40 years and would feature proxy wars in battle locations from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other regions.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans ceased to be beneficial almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian Front and the Ukrainian Front, after invading Poland's eastern territories, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way for transoceanic movement of large segments of the population and merchandise.
The work of sailors from old times aimed to ensure that your country can transport your own people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from transporting theirs and their goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, was attempting to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies failed, the Germans would likely have been able to conquer Britain as they did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably domesticated for the first time in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, often watched over by goatherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These breeding methods are still used today.
Wooden railways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wooden tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The wooden rail ties appeared quite early and were intended to hold the railroad tracks in place. Gradually, however, it became apparent that the tracks would be much more functional with an iron support on top.
Such a method was common, but iron caused greater damage to the wheels of the wooden wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first railway lines entirely made of iron appeared.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as is customary.
Features of bipedal movement have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We have the ability to lead a more sustainable life, to become part of the environmental movement, and possibly to act in an activist manner to somehow limit future problems.
It's like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not desire a temporary solution, we will need to discover the source of the issues and neutralize them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological achievements of humanity, and that problems have increased due to overpopulation and the wasteful way of life.
After its approval by Congress on July 4, the handwritten note signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were issued, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8th in the outdoor area of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent on July 6th to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another one arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that we know still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript was not preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that a species of dinosaurs has survived to the present day. They are referring to birds.
Many do not consider them in the category of dinosaurs because they have feathers and the ability to fly.
However, many things about birds make them resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two feet like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Computers nowadays are based on the management of information encoded in a binary system.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can only take one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The most reliable sign that someone has been internally poisoned is an open bottle of medicine or some toxic household chemical substance in the area.
Read the label for special first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term "koreos" is officially used by etymologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from the familiarity of the ancients with bedbugs, which were insects that easily adapted to parasitize humans.
The assassin bug and the bedbug are nest-dwelling, adapted to live in the nest or the shell of their host.
In the United States of America, around 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the main neurological condition among young and middle-aged individuals.
Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
Two partners can decide that raising an infant is not in their best interest or in the interest of the child they have.
These couples can plan an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method essentially guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation does not exist on its own, and specifically, the experiment is a trial conducted to refute one or more possible hypotheses, the asking of questions and observation also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and specifically on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's positions on scientific issues, including psychology among them, enjoyed acceptance.
As Greek intellectual thought lost ground, the West became disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that often the rhythms noted in physiology and behavior depend on the existence of endogenous cycles, as well as on their production, which is carried out through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that perpetuate their cyclic function indefinitely even when they lack external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase took phages, or microbes, in order to insert their genetic material into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA of the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may result in a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the role of the section of genetic material it affects, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be inherited by offspring, as mutations in other cells may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are looking for natural landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the wild flora and fauna of the area.
Examples of activities in a given location include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information concerning the ecosystem.
For example, some people visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their workplaces and meet others whose work destination is the place from which the former have just departed.
In dynamic shuttle transportation, everyone is connected to each other in some way and supports a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Today, science shows that this vast carbon economy has driven the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported the evolution of the human species over the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses some transportation system. And almost everyone expresses complaints about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges are rarely heard at the same level.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental to blame?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the traffic of specific drivers and cars between two places and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is not easy, as it is impossible to predict driver behavior with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range of reasonable consistency; thus, traffic streams tend to have some logical consistency and can be approximately mathematically represented.
To best represent traffic flow intensity, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assisted in the preparation, planning, and operations of road network facilities.
The first animals to take to the air were insects. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies backwards.
This provides them with a greater variety of small hideouts from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many years ago, Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some believed that he was right, but many thought the opposite, namely that the Solar System revolved around the Earth and the Sun (even around other stars).
It seems logical, since the Earth doesn't appear to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest overall river on the planet. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the river with the greatest width worldwide, sometimes reaching 6 miles.
20% of the water that rivers discharge into the world's oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size and technical perfection in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were impressed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official announcements.
The Italian language is also used in daily life by most people who work for the state, while the Latin language is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of these can be found in nature in raw form, and their extraction with primitive tools is relatively easy.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is created by the mixture of one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
Primarily, it looked like the four forms of matter (in that sequence): solid, liquid, air, and plasma, although he also assumed that they transform into new substances in order to shape this presence.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many chemical elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metal elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is composed of very small particles, atoms.
The size of atoms is so extremely small that trillions of them could fit in the period that is located at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerge, the status and usefulness of the pencil have been downgraded.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to use a pencil sharpener.
One might wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Breaking the core again releases part of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and this leads them to decay if they are subjected to even slight or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. This would allow lava to more easily reach the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what makes people tick or what attracts them.
These theories assert that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what is in their environment that will lead them to do or not do specific things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general terms, two behaviors may emerge when managers start to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain as "one of the guys" (or gals).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary measures, conduct evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one can transform into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything the group has done and take ownership of it.
After all, the one ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team is the captain.
This behavior often leads to a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are formed with the same integrity principles as conventional teams; however, there are small differences.
The virtual team members often act as a link to their immediate physical team.
Often, they are more autonomous than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, something that may not be acceptable to their local management.
The existence of a "hidden team" truth (Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p. 109) is yet another unique element of a virtual team.
Everyone is introduced to the "invisible team" of management. This team sets the specifications for all participants.
Why would an organization want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing organizational capabilities learning? One of the goals for the practical application of the concepts of organizational capabilities learning is innovation.
Creativity and intelligence are favored when all available resources are appropriately utilized in the operational departments of an organization.
As a result, the process within which an organization collaborates to overcome an obstacle can lead to new and innovative procedures in favor of serving customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, management must create an environment of innovation, knowledge exchange, and organizational learning.
The explanation given by Anchel (2006) for the approach of continuous learning describes it as a method used to help organizations increase their performance level.
Neurobiological data provides empirical evidence for a theoretical study of cognition. Thus, they limit the breadth of the research by making it clearer.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is an aid for researchers and their study.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and may cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that humans have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes that occur in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence largely alludes to science fiction, it is nevertheless an important branch of computer science that deals with the adaptation of behavior, learning, and intelligence in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence involves the construction of machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, responses to customer diagnoses and questions, but also handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and facial recognition.
These are now separate principles, which focus on providing solutions to real everyday problems.
The AI system is often used nowadays in the fields of finance, healthcare, engineering, and the armed forces, and it is even present in various computer software applications for home use and cyberspace games.
Excursions are an important element of every class. Very often a teacher would like to take their students to places where access by bus, however, is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while they are in their classroom.
Essentially, participating in a trip also constitutes an important opportunity to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and it is updated annually, but the old versions are maintained online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing skills. While students' experience with blogs often begins with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
As students often make up the most critical audience, the blogger begins to do his best to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Also, participating in blogs "forces students to become more articulate about the world around them." The need to maintain the audience's interest inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Managing a website is a technique that promotes teamwork and encourages students to learn more beyond what they traditionally learn at school in the morning.
"The proper use of blogs 'can encourage students to use more analytical and critical thinking, as through active engagement with online material, students can define their positions in the context of texts from other individuals, as well as express their own perceptions on specific topics' (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the enchanting, bilingual capital of Canada, which includes a wide range of galleries and museums showcasing the old and contemporary Canada.
Southward lie the Niagara Falls and to the north is the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these and many more characterize Ontario as the quintessence of the Canadian character as it is perceived by foreigners.
Large zones in the even more northern part are quite sparsely populated, while some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many: African Americans living in the USA outnumber Canadians.
The islands of Eastern Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and constitutes a continent in itself in terms of its wildlife species.
Almost all the islets are independent or have French origins, and are renowned for offering luxurious maritime havens.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to the region, and it spread to a great extent as far as the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonization began in the 15th century, when the explorer Vasco da Gama, who hailed from Portugal, discovered the route around the Cape that leads from Europe to India.
The place is enclosed to the north by the Sahel, while the Atlantic borders its southern and western sides.
Women: It is recommended that every woman traveling declare she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that habits differing in culture can lead to actions that might be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon for people to follow them, grab them by the hand, etc.
Be unwavering when you reject a man and do not be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, it is not an excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids who gave it the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Daru al-Bayda, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca ranks among the places that present the least interest for shopping in the whole of Morocco.
It is easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but they are all touristy.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a high number of tourists at the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma suffered devastation due to the Nyiragongo volcano, whose lava covered almost all the streets of the city, especially its center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be planned to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest gorilla tracking and observation programs in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. Usually, the (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has acquired the metaphorical meaning of an exotic, faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites because it is threatened by desert sand.
This is one of the most important stops during Henry Louis Gates' program on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) about the unique Wonders of the African World.
The city is completely different from the other cities in the country, as it primarily has an Arab atmosphere rather than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northern and eastern part of South Africa and is located along the border line with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while its southern border is considered the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different areas of ecological interest, each supporting different species of wildlife.
It is one of the most remarkable attractions of South Africa and is referred to as the emblem of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As is the case with all National Parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation entry fees for the park.
It may be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entrance to either selected parks in South Africa or all of its national parks.
The island of Hong Kong names both the territory of Hong Kong and is an attraction for many visitors.
The grandeur of the buildings that shape the urban skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a radiant bar graph, highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For a better view in Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon waterfront.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island has predominantly been densely packed on reclaimed lands along the northern coast.
This is the part that the British colonizers occupied and, therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest area in the world, stretching 80 km into the mainland of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they include some of the last pieces of the majestic jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by water/swamp zones.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that today there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the interregional station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 7:30.
Due to the fact that interregional buses are usually full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster-type buses, which are characterized by their comfort and durability.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, and have two corridors with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and the traffic was closed off until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when it is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will have been completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the lands that are now known as eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the conflict between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The period of colonization, which lasted three centuries, began with the Spanish.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The main tournament annually takes place in the last month of the year at the Las Canitas water polo pools.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and ticket sales points for water polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is equal to the value of the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley across from the FIG West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are usually accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to convert Falkland currency outside of the islands, so exchange the currency before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter cold is deceptive: temperatures rarely drop below zero, yet the wind and humidity combine to create the sensation that it is colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human presence, their wild nature remains wild, which is why we should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, maintain at least 100 yards/meters distance from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters distance from all other wild animals!
As calm as bison, Canadian deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals may seem, they can nevertheless attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain appropriate distances. These animals are large, wild, and can become dangerous, so give them space.
Also, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking foods with strong odors and keep the camping area clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850, and since 1959 it has been the official capital of Samoa.
A famous naval confrontation had taken place at the harbor in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to depart from it.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the murder of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland has two harbors. The most popular ones are located in this area.
The beaches of the Northern Coast (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches suitable for safe swimming, and most of them even have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour of the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes full of families with quite a variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is called "Number One" and it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
A wide variety of French wines are available for tasting, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia may be a better choice.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
In Australia, the idea of a flat white coffee is foreign. The short black is an espresso, the cappuccino is topped with cream and not froth, and tea is consumed without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but amazing.
Throughout the year, many trips take place on the reef, and injuries resulting from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you are advised by the authorities, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
Since 1770, box jellyfish have been appearing near beaches and river mouths from October to April. Occasionally, one can spot them at different times.
Sharks do indeed exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of them and would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the sea; their primary natural habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers ensure that they will have a place to stay when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but through an agent, you can also make reservations for other types of accommodations like camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, arrangements for airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
Your application can be put on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or to gather other documents for your trip (e.g., visa).
However, any modifications or requests should first be referred to the travel agent and not sent directly to the hotel.
With regard to some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp there, and most consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you should start early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music may end on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music will continue late into the night.
Some festivals provide dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in the winter, check your cabin's location, as when the ship passes through ice, it creates terrible noises for those who are most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time that you will stay in the city. Those boarding the ship are not required to have a visa (see terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money visitors spend. Windows and clocks are absent, and exits are hard to find.
Often, there are special offers on food, drink, and entertainment to keep customers in a good mood and within the business premises.
In various venues, free alcoholic drinks are offered. However, intoxication affects judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Whoever plans to travel by road at high altitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and very low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is not enough traction, and driving is difficult compared to bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, it can snow so much that it traps you in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall, moisture, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, where traffic continues mostly without interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attractions in Africa and a sight for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used to describe the land journey with the purpose of visiting the stunning African wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars, and the basic equipment will aid in good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
The walking safari (also known as "bush walk" or "hiking safari") consists of a hike lasting either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, as it initially hosted them in 1964.
If you arranged how you would fly and where you would stay for 2020 before it was announced that they would be postponed, you might face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary; however, from the end of March, most cancellation policies due to coronavirus are not extended for July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, while the price of standard tickets is approximately 7,000 yen.
Ironing can help with drying wet clothes. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards for borrowing, even if they are not available in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you are not interested in wearing ironed socks, in this case, you can use a hair dryer, if it is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are various ways of purifying water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, one minute of boiling the water is enough, but in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in terms of effectiveness and if you have any concerns, then you should consider the possibility of buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter infectious animals that they are not accustomed to encountering in areas of their country.
Pests destroy food, cause irritations, or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, carry poison, and transmit infections.
Contagious diseases or wild animals that have the ability to attack or brutally kill humans are not often characterized as harmful organisms.
Duty-free shopping offers the opportunity to purchase goods at specific locations without the burden of duties and special consumption taxes.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is very dangerous for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway, because it passes through many lonely rural areas.
If you are not accustomed to driving on rural roads, keep your eyes open: the roads are dominated by steep gradients, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), and it is even more important to strictly adhere to them.
However, oddly enough, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than along other parts of the route, such as, for example, in the Wilds of Pennsylvania.
German sweets are quite high quality, while in Bavaria one can find them in abundance and variety, similar to those of its southern neighboring country, Austria.
Desserts with fruits usually include apples, which are used to make sweets all year round, and cherries and plums, which appear in the summer.
A large number of German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The famous cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you desire small yet very tasty baked goods, try those called berliners, fankuchen, or krapfen.
Curry consists of herbs and spices and is accompanied by foods of animal or plant origin.
You can find curry "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a comprehensive term that includes a wide variety of cuisines from regions across the country.
But if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to imply the food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
It can now be found everywhere in the archipelago, the local cuisine of Java offers a menu of slightly spiced dishes, with essential aromatic ingredients favored by the Javanese, such as peanuts, chili, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar) and many aromatic spices.
Stirrups are used as support for the rider's lower limbs and are held from the right and left side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider; however, they may pose safety challenges due to the chances of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If someone who is riding falls off the horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them along the road as it runs. To prevent this from happening, certain safety precautions are taken.
Initially, most riders have special shoes that have heels, a soft and relatively small sole.
Subsequently, some of the saddles, especially the English ones, are equipped with safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if pulled backward by the rider as they fall.
Cochamó Valley - A key climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America with a variety of big walls and granite rocks.
The mountaintops offer stunning views from the hills. Climbers from all over the world are making new routes along the endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down sloped terrain covered in snow with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, often called ski bums, planning entire ski vacations to a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depict skiers dating back to 5,000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport can be traced back even to the 17th century, while in 1861, the first skiing club for recreation was founded in Australia by some Norwegians.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or alpine skiing.
It is related to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but usually does not include them, as the latter are done on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar distance coverage by hiking.
Under ideal conditions, you'll be able to cover relatively greater distances than by walking - but you will very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on specially designed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, visiting many countries during the trip would require applying for visas and multiple passport checks.
The Schengen Area, however, one could say, functions like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you are generally permitted to cross borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the member states of the Schengen area, saving time, money, and bureaucratic procedures.
There is no universal definition by which a processed product is classified as an antique. Certain tax services define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, as the age limit may be lower in places such as North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important occupation for the Sami, while the culture surrounding the trade is also significant for many involved in other professions.
Even traditionally, of course, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but some made a living from fishing, hunting, and other activities, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sami, the region of the Sami people.
Despite its widespread use, especially among people who are not Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccuracies concerning the Roma.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also consult the guidelines of other governments besides your own, although their guidelines are designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
The instructions are merely an overview of the domestic political events.
The views presented are often concise, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a general term that includes any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human lives.
Extreme weather phenomena can occur in all parts of the earth, categorized based on geographical, topographical, or atmospheric conditions.
Forms and consequences of bad weather include strong winds, hail, torrential rainfall, and fires, as well as storms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and cyclones.

Those planning a trip to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Training Course" will likely display the address of a local company.
Normally, a lesson will cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually due to practical exercises.
A course will usually last 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of training regarding first aid, and sometimes with weapons.
Books and magazines that deal with desert survival are common; however, publications focused on war zones are scarce.
Those who travel and are planning gender reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The intention of governments to issue passports without stating gender (X) or documents that have been updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The appetite of foreign governments to respect these specific documents changes significantly as well.
Security checkpoint inspections have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender individuals who are preoperative cannot expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Surface currents are the returning flows from waves breaking on the beach, often on a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flows converge in certain deeper sections where strong currents may form at great depths.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
Once you are off current, swimming towards the shore will not be more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a point where you have not been trapped before, or, based on your skills and whether you have been detected, it might be preferable to wait to be rescued.
The shock of returning begins before the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase shortens), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture sometimes face difficulties in readapting to their native culture.
When you return to your country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your habits that belonged to your country's culture.
When you first went abroad, it is likely that people were patient and understanding, as they know that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
Many may not anticipate the patience and understanding required of travelers for the journey back home.
One of the events that take place in the area and are of great interest to children is the sound and light show of the pyramid.
You watch the pyramids at night in silence before the show begins.
You usually always hear the sounds of tourists and merchants. The history of sound and light seems exactly like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is both the backdrop and the narrator of a great story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are the subject of claims by many countries and host the most bases, as there were sixteen active ones in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, which also has the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula, which is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula join with the plateau at this point, and then reappear to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is bisected by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest elevation being the summit of Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
In remote areas where there is no phone signal, a satellite phone may be your only option.
The satellite phone does not replace the mobile phone in general, because you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in navigation, including pleasure boats, as well as for missions that use remote data and have voice communication needs.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
A choice that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It particularly appeals to individuals who have finished school, as it allows them to take a gap year before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In several cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can increase the chances of advancing to higher education in your country.
Tuition is usually required for enrollment in such educational programs.
Finland is an ideal place for boat rides. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," you will also find thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
The boat will not necessarily be useful to you in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any recreational vessel, smaller boats or even kayaks provide an alternative experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This can be compared to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand but, generally speaking, it is particularly unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Almost all special cruises in the Baltic include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you disembark in the city only through excursions organized by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As shown on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be considered a very frightening experience by people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something you should be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and resentments about other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding how the aircraft operates and what happens during the flight can help them overcome the phobia that is based on the unknown or on the lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for the rapid delivery of goods. Quite often, time is a critical factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
The largest companies, for some routes, have their own planes, but problems arise with regard to other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent goods via air freight, on certain flights it may take days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster would be to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that is where your role begins.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a bunch of money for the privileged seat (or even better, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, this comes at a cost: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for a business class ticket and eleven times for a first class ticket!
Generally, there is no reason to even look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a key category of passengers who are willing to spend a lot of money for the privilege of a quick and comfortable journey to their destination, and they charge accordingly.
Chișinău is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian; however, Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a democratic multi-ethnic state that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency; however, it has not been officially recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have resumed, despite the fact that political negotiations failed.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey with almost 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a key meeting point for transportation.
The modern, sophisticated, and populated Smyrna, which has existed since ancient times, is situated around a very large gulf and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades, and the modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, even though the atmosphere of the city is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

Do not vandalize the area by painting or carving graffiti on the structures.
The official dialects of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half choose to speak Catalan, the majority understand the language, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are written only in the Catalan language, as it has been legally established as the first official language.
Nonetheless, the Spanish language is extensively used in public transportation and other services.
Typical announcements on the underground railway are made only in Catalan, but non-standard disruptions are broadcasted by an automatic machine that features a range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The residents of Paris are reputed for their self-centeredness, rudeness, and arrogance.
Although it is often merely an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to display your best behavior, as if you are someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). It will make your interactions much easier.
The abrupt attitude of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show basic courtesy.
In the national park at Plitvice Lake, there is a lush forest with beeches, spruces, and firs, while the flora is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It presents a remarkable variety concerning plant communities thanks to the different microclimates, soil diversity, and varying altitudes.
The place has a significant variety of categories of animals and birds.

When visiting monasteries, women must wear a skirt that covers up to the knees, and the shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries provide long skirts for women who have come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
In the same way, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this from the inventory at the entrance, but this particular garment is not washed after each use and therefore you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. It is one size for men!

The first letter in all nouns, as well as the word Sie (you), is always written with a capital letter, even within the sentence.
This is how the verbal forms are distinguished from the objects based on a rule.
One could argue that it makes reading easier, even though writing is relatively complex due to the need to discover whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively easy since the majority of words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters that require your attention are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows.

However, those who have a limited knowledge of Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that one does not need to study it separately.
Today, premodern observatories are usually obsolete and are preserved as museums or educational spaces.
As light pollution was not the problem it is today when they were at their peak, they are often found in cities or on university campuses, and access to them is easier than to those built in modern times.
Most research telescopes of our time are large installations in remote locations that have suitable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept has its origins in China where plum blossoms were the flower of the season.
The first celebrations for the blooming cherry blossoms that took place in Japan were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other nobles belonging to his Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation and do not remove any samples.

All the animals that initially arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to travel, making the giant tortoise the first herbivorous animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have made their appearance, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in the winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.

The fact that the areas are sparsely populated and therefore there is no problem with light pollution gives you the opportunity to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work mentality has a more hierarchical and formal character compared to what Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits constitute typical professional attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or their job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is of vital importance, as emphasis is placed on teamwork rather than on the recognition of individual achievements.
Employees often need the approval of their superiors for every decision, and they must follow the instructions of their higher-ups without objections.
