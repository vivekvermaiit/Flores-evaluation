This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory that has already gained widespread acceptance—but also provides details that fossils usually cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are chestnut-colored at the top and light or carrot-colored at the bottom.
This discovery also helps in gaining deeper insights into the evolution of bird feathers.
The feathers of the dinosaurs did not have well-developed main stems—known as "rachis"—but still had other features of feathers, such as barbs and barbules. Researchers inferred that the evolution of the rachis might have occurred later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers believe that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature plumage rather than juvenile feathers.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, rather than the down of a hatchling.

"To put it bluntly, he [Wells] lied to us from the very beginning. Firstly, he acted as if he was doing it for legal reasons. Secondly, he first pretended to listen to our opinions, and then he directly deleted these works of art."
Due to public outrage, policies related to sexual content are currently being drafted for the website. The site has millions of media with public distribution licenses.
Most of the completed work is theoretical, but the purpose of writing the program is to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for may be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way as it does ordinary matter.
The theory suggests that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in some sort of halo around the galaxy, composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered this extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that this new variant is "very disturbing and concerning because its fatality rate is very high."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients might have contracted bacteria in the hospital, and at least two of the patients are hospital medical staff.
Within a year, one infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the proportion of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis among the entire tuberculosis patient population still appears to be very low; in South Africa, at any given time, only 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people are infected.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations between day and night suggest that these places are likely caves.
Compared to the surrounding surfaces, they are cooler during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which typically maintain a fairly constant temperature, but they are very similar to conditions in deep underground pits," said Glen Cushing of the USGS Astrogeology team in Flagstaff, Arizona, and Northern Arizona University.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter a small booth and put a pre-printed slip of paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter register.
The French electoral law has established quite strict regulations for the election procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in the box at the start of voting, and can also see that no one other than timely verified eligible voters puts envelopes into the box.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each stage of the election process on site. In the evening, volunteers count the votes according to specific procedures under strict supervision.

Attorney General and Queen's Counsel Kier Starmer made a statement this morning, announcing the prosecution of Huhne and Pryce.
Huhne has resigned, and his position in the cabinet will be filled by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to replace Davey as the Business Secretary.
Hoonah and Price will appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. At the time, the driver was Cuddeback.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and chin, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstructive surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned when it was aimed at the fifth person's head. Schneider was in excruciating pain, with one eye blinded and a piece of skull missing, his face had to be reconstructed with a titanium plate.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF (United States Air Force) base in his homeland.
Besides the match on Wednesday, Carpanedo also participated in two individual events in the tournament.
Her first event was slalom skiing, and she finished the first round with a "Did Not Finish" result. Among the 116 participants in the competition, 36 achieved the same result.
Her other race was the giant slalom, in which she placed tenth in the women's standing category with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes. She was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian competitor Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian competitor Gongki Dani.
In the women's sitting category, four skiing athletes did not finish the race, and in the Giant Slalom event, 45 out of 117 athletes failed to make it to the list.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested 5 people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although the car hit the house while there were three people inside, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver's head was severely injured.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed, and emergency rescuers have saved the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was sent to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Thereafter, Adakeya was charged with the murder of her son and was tried at the Edinburgh Magistrates' Court.
She is being detained, awaiting prosecution and trial; however, any witness testimony may be negatively impacted because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's judicial system is different, and the court believes that releasing the photos could potentially cause harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out: "If journalists publish photos and other information of the suspect, there does seem to be a risk."
The main department responsible for prosecution, the Crown Prosecution Service, told reporters that there will be no further comments at least until the prosecution is initiated.
According to reports, the document will address the border dispute, with Palestine hoping to base it on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
According to reports, other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a decade-long military deployment in the valley after the agreement was signed, while the Palestinian National Authority only agreed to keep it for five years.
Rangers will closely monitor the shooters participating in the pest control supplementary experiment, as the experiment will be supervised and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration between the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), the association recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage Management at the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), stated: The four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have all undergone comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of 9 members.
This is Martelly's fifth time being selected for the Haitian Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former CEO as part of measures to push the country towards new elections.
The committee is Martelly's response to the large anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protests have been triggered by the failure of some elections to be held as scheduled, sometimes escalating into violent incidents.
According to reports, there have been approximately 60 incidents of iPod malfunctions and overheating, resulting in 6 fires and minor burns to 4 people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that they have noted 27 incidents related to the device.
Last week, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple Inc. reported another 34 incidents of overheating to the department, although the company stated that these incidents were "not serious."
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry responded by saying it is "very regrettable" that Apple has delayed the release of the report.
An earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office stated that there have been no reported disaster losses domestically.
Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that no signs of a tsunami were detected.
A former police officer in the Philippines hijacked a tourist bus in the capital, Manila, taking the Hong Kong tourists on board as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza raised his M16 rifle and fired at the tourists.
Multiple hostages have been rescued, and at least six hostages have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages (including children and the elderly) as well as the Filipino photographers were released early.
The two photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his career as a doctor.
He received training as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research indicates that the administration of hormones can accelerate the maturation of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Supreme Queen, my first manager. Luna passed away on a dual-moon night. Such nights are as special as she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels, known as "Goldust," commented: "Luna was as elusive as I am... she might even be harder to figure out... I love her and will miss her... hope she is in a better place."
A survey was conducted with 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, and the number of respondents opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II steps down.
34% of respondents agreed that they hope Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
The voting is polarized, with 29% of respondents believing that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100m, 200m freestyle, and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but concerns about his health have been raised due to his complaints.
He has been unable to use medication to relieve the pain because the competition prohibits participants from taking these drugs.
Mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper from the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain the continuity of life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets have formed since a comet collided with Earth long ago, especially the formation of Earth.
The 53-year-old Cuomo has been serving as governor since the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political ramblings and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States stated that the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) can shorten flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to more precisely locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional transportation services, the overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking lots or park and ride facilities available.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the match might be forced to take place behind closed doors without the support of team supporters.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal Science reported that a new bird species has formed in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that due to the interbreeding between the local native medium ground finch and the introduced large cactus finch in the Galápagos Islands, this new species evolved in just two generations, despite the belief that this process would take a longer time.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be curled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into fine threads for winding and braiding. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. Because it is so thin, it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is referred to as the pH value of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice will change based on the acidity or alkalinity of chemicals.
The pH value is represented by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being measured.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders to mix them, then use clean, wet hands to knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, forming something like a shell, which feels very interesting.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, in these two cities, almost every household had a flush toilet, which was connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Traces of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths that were co-ed.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you will use a satellite.
After receiving the call, the satellite in space almost immediately reflected it back.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes certain light and vision to distort.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
Wheels have changed the world in incredible ways. Their greatest contribution to us is making our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits and antelopes to deer.
Ultimately, many small felines (including free-roaming pet cats) feed on much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the niche concept, where each cat is responsible for a special task, preventing them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, living in large groups known as prides.
A pride of lions consists of one to three adult males who are related, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters within the larger family, females usually have close relationships with each other.
The behavior of a pride of lions is very similar to that of a pack of wolves or dogs. These animals exhibit behavior strikingly similar to lions (but unlike other large cats), and such behavior is also extremely lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete; it can climb (although its climbing ability is not very strong), swim, and jump long distances, with pulling strength up to five times that of a human strongman.
Tigers, along with lions, leopards, and jaguars, belong to the same type (genus Panthera). These four big cats are the only felines capable of roaring.
A tiger's roar is not as deep as a lion's roar, but more like an angry hissing word.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. If conditions allow, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. The prey of leopard cats is almost always much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey animals by scent and sniffing the traces of their targets on the ground.
Their night vision is very strong, allowing them to see clearly in the dark and move stealthily. The hunting method of the leopard cat is to first blend into the surroundings, then pounce on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from their original main population (for example, if they cross mountains and rivers, or if they reach a new island so that it is not easy to return), they often find that the environment they are in is different from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new populations will need different traits or adaptations to become strong competitors, rather than those they previously required.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need to adapt to the environment just as before.
Over time, the new populations began to adapt to the new environment, and they started becoming increasingly dissimilar to other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will eventually look so different that they can no longer be referred to as the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which is the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and a crucial part of it.
Plants can produce oxygen for humans to inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They can also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, fearing nothing except others of its own kind.
Its long lower jaw is filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there is another row on the upper jaw. This means that anything that encounters it has no escape.
Its tongue might be forked, but we are not sure about that yet. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even eat humans.
It attacks anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus rex are no match for it.
Although most of the Roman diet consisted of what we are familiar with, they did have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women eat sitting on chairs, while the rich like to gather for banquets, eating while reclining.
Foods that were introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later could not have appeared in the diet of ancient Romans.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, regarding it as the dwelling place of that god.
People offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests fulfill the needs of the gods through rituals and celebrations.
Every temple has a courtyard open to the public, as well as an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Some special towers are pyramid-shaped, known as "pyramid temples," and are constructed as part of a temple.
The top of the tower is a special sacred place of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not that important.
Life in Hebrew families is mostly spent outdoors.
The women are cooking in the courtyard; the shop is actually just an open counter facing the street. They use stones to build houses.
Canaan does not have large forests, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing murder, and he sailed west, discovered land, and named it Greenland.
But whether he discovered it or not, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although they all belong to "Scandinavia," there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not the case. Although there is something written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the "Declaration of Independence" is inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and is upside down.
Although no one can be certain who the author is, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is purported to have been stored rolled up when it was first written.
Therefore, it is likely that this symbol was added merely as a label.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south still remained unliberated.
It was governed by "Vichy" French. These French people made a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, not resisting the invaders, but cooperating with them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded southern France, and this offensive was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a group of people (society) who live together and work cooperatively.
The term "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis" (meaning "of a citizen"), and is related to the Latin "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "city-state"), which in some way also defines the scale of society.
The city-state is the predecessor of the nation. Civic culture means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the lingering traces of culture that remain, and the fair dissemination of culture.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not considered respectable civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (Congress was its sole component).
Congress does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial branch, Congress can only rely on state governments to implement all laws, and the state governments often do not cooperate.
It also does not have the power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
These articles must receive unanimous consent from all states in order to be amended, and the states have such a dismissive attitude towards the central government that their state representatives often fail to attend.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are both the second most successful teams in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the world’s seventh-largest island nation!
Due to the large number of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geological perspective.
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing European sailors named the island "Ilha Formosa," meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, began changing the indigenous people's methods of food production, and employed Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire declared the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana (Hitching Post of the Sun), the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
In order to give tourists a better understanding of the original appearance of the complex, most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for static image photography in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the film era.
To this day, it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high, which makes the format somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) have the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The often misused and mocked rule of thirds can serve as a simple guideline for creating dynamics, while also keeping the image organized.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was closely monitored.
Despite the different languages and customs of various European countries, Christianity has been linking them together for more than a thousand years.
From the king to the common people, its pervasive power influences everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary funds are established specifically for this purpose.
The centralized church authority existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether they were adhering to this creed.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain began implementing a naval blockade against Germany.
They cut off the vital military and civilian supplies. This strategy proved effective, despite such a blockade violating the widely accepted international law established under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom has laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire sea area, posing a threat even to neutral countries' vessels.
Because of the limited response to this strategy, Germany expected its unrestricted submarine warfare to also have a similar response.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and isolationist.
After witnessing the ravages and brutality of World War I, all countries were eager to avoid making the same mistakes again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job with Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, to Thomas Edison.
Each period in ancient China had its own characteristics; every era or every ruling family that held power in China was a distinctly characterized dynasty.
Similarly, the transitions between various dynasties have always been periods of instability characterized by the division of smaller states. The most famous of these is the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period, which occurred between the transitions from the Han to the Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, various feudal lords engaged in fierce wars to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Tens of thousands of people died fighting for the supreme power of the luxurious palaces in Xi'an.
There are also many social and political impacts, such as the use of units of measurement, the shift from autocracy to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation does not belong to a sole ruler but to the people.
Furthermore, after the revolution, official positions were open to applications from all men, allowing the most ambitious and successful individuals the opportunity to rise to prominence.
The military is the same way, as the ranks are no longer based on hierarchy, but on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond earthly life. He used to often go to a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (meaning "Light") to meditate.
The cave itself not only withstood the test of time and was preserved, but also brought an extremely vivid image to Muhammad's spiritual intent.
The cave is located at the top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even knowing of its existence, it is not easy to find. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated from the outside world.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. Inside the cave, one can barely see or hear any sights or sounds from the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, and it is one of the many large pyramids built to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead (known as the "Giza Pyramid Complex") includes several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), a number of small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to commemorate Khufu's wife and family members.
The "upper bow" symbol resembles the letter V, while the "lower bow" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means to push the bow from the tip, while down means to pull the bow from the root (the area where the hand holds the bow).
The up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while the down-bow produces a stronger, more assertive tone.
Please feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed notes are musically significant, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), along with the king's sister Madame Élisabeth, were driven back to Paris from Versailles by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to fully open the carriage windows.
In front of the terrified queen, a thug once waved the head of a royal guard, who had been killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, as well as the interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the high profits gained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people became the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that led to the formation of the Knights Templar.
The era in which the event took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, which is the period of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally is considered to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, including technopush, technological imperative, and a strict definition—the fate of humanity is driven by the underlying logic associated with the laws of science and its manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism include these two general ideas: first, the development of technology itself largely surpasses cultural or political influences; second, technology, in turn, has an inherent "impact" on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, someone might say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, it was economically unfeasible to build a national highway network for only a few cars, so a new method of production emerged to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A high number of Volkswagen cars on the road will lead to a higher rate of road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies for treating the injured.
Romanticism has strong cultural determinism characteristics. This stems from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerge. These customs and cultures are much better than any arbitrarily imposed laws because they harmoniously blend with the place where society is situated.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center for luxury goods began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to the 11th century until the 14th century.
In the beginning, skirts were deeply influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the greatest advancements of the time was that after the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agricultural activity conducted to produce only the food needed by the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses locally preserved seeds within the eco-zone, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture. Today, in many developing countries, the situation remains the same.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal norms, fostering a sense of identity among them.
Subcultures may each have their own distinct characteristics given differences in members' age, race, class, location, and/or gender.
The qualities that make a subculture distinct may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or multiple factors.
Members of subcultural groups often symbolically use unique styles of behavior to indicate their membership, including fashionable clothing, mannerisms, and slang.
To illustrate the importance of socialization, one of the most commonly used methods is to use the cases of a few unfortunate children. These children, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have failed to achieve socialization in their growth process with the help of adults.
Such children are called "feral children," meaning wild children. Some feral children are confined by people (often their own parents); in some cases, the children are abandoned because their parents refuse to accept that the child has severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Before being abandoned or running away from home, a wild child may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma.
It is said that some people were raised by animals; some live alone in the wild.
If a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, their behavior (within the limits of physical capability) will be very similar to that of the animal, such as displaying fear or indifference toward humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolded learning goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a means to assist those who are just learning to use new computer programs or start new projects.
Scaffolding teaching can be conducted online or offline, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding teaching, much like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is integrated into the software to question, prompt, and explain processes that might be challenging for students to handle independently.
Children are fostered for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without upbringing, love, and education, but things do not always go as desired.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide everything that is lacking in their original family.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet add extra dimensions to its uses and ways of fulfillment.
For example, "learning" and "interaction" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
When studying the audience's reaction to a website, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also considered "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational factors.
The use of video has brought significant discoveries in interpreting microexpressions (facial movements lasting a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that those who are unable to comprehend language due to brain damage are still able to accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior might be a skill shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century indicates that there are two pools of genetic variation: dominant and recessive.
Mutations add new genetic variations, while selection removes variations from the pool of expressed genetic variations.
Due to segregation and recombination, variations fluctuate between the two pools in each generation.
On the tropical savannahs, primates have a digestive system similar to humans, and the existing plant resources are hard to meet primates' demand for amino acids.
Furthermore, failure to achieve this can result in serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant-based resources are likely the proteins in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, digesting this type of protein is difficult unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (such as ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In conclusion, if the way our ancestors addressed the "protein problem" is no different from the methods used by chimpanzees on the tropical savannas today, we should not be surprised.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep and then falling asleep again after a short period (10-60 minutes).
It's easy to do by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that wakes you up without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm while sleeping, you can place the alarm on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other chronobiological choices include drinking large amounts of liquid (especially water or tea, which are known to have diuretic effects) before bedtime, forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The extent of a person's inner calm is inversely related to the level of physical and mental tension.
The less pressure there is, the more positively vitality is expressed. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of reaching the state of enlightenment, and the only obstacles to achieving it are our own tensions and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels, and activating chakras, one achieves a state of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy of all countries during World War II, which facilitated cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts in systems, procedures, and culture caused the two countries to part ways.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had now become enemies, initiating the onset of the Cold War.
The war lasted for 40 years, with proxy armies engaging in real combat on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been breached, and the only remaining hope was to retreat and reorganize the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost abandoned overnight. After violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading eastern regions of Poland, more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the country and established positions in Belarus and Ukraine.
So far, shipping has been the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the navy's mission is to ensure the country maintains the ability to transport personnel and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their personnel and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and materials across the Atlantic to assist Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, with U-boats as its main force, attempted to intercept this transport.
If the Allies had lost at that time, Germany would likely have conquered Britain just as it had conquered other European countries.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, consume their milk, meat, wool, and use their hides.
Domestic goats are usually grazed in herds on mountains or other pastures, and they are often tended by goat herders (mostly children or teenagers), similar to the more well-known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
As early as the 16th century, Britain had built wagon roads.
Although the horse-drawn tramways were merely assembled from parallel wooden planks, at that time, considering the slightly bumpy roads, these vehicles allowed the pulling horses to run faster and carry more.
Sleepers were introduced very early to fix the rails. However, people gradually realized that if iron plates were placed on the rails, the rails would be more stable and effective.
This became a common practice, but the iron rims would cause more severe wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rail was introduced.
The first known form of transportation is walking. About two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means "upright man," humans began walking upright.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
In the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago, evidence of bipedal specialization has been found, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become environmental activists to some extent to reduce future disasters.
In many cases, this is very similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it completely.
It is obvious that due to the progress of human science and technology, the world has undergone significant changes, and overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humans have exacerbated the problem.
The handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th, after which it was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away for printing.
Between 150 to 200 copies, known today as the "Dunlap broadsides," were printed overnight.
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of the letters was sent to George Washington on July 6, and Washington read it to his army in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The remaining 25 Dunlap broadsides are the earliest existing versions of this document. The original handwritten manuscript has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and continue to live to this day, which we call "birds."
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on processing binary encoded information.
A binary number can only take on one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits, or "bits" in computer terminology.
Poisoning inside the body may not manifest immediately, and symptoms such as vomiting are very common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The strongest indicator of poison ingestion may be the opened containers found at the scene, containing drugs or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label on the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists formally use the term "bug" to refer to this class of insects.
This term originates from people's familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs are both nidicolous insects, adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In various regions of the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making this disease one of the primary neurological disorders among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
A couple may decide not to have children either in their own interests or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may make adoption plans for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminated their parental rights so that another couple could raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world operates through scientific methods. In fact, this method can guide most scientific research.
An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. However, experimenting is not the only method. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific fields (including psychology) were accepted one by one.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West drifted away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the physiological rhythms and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers often largely depend on the endogenous cycles produced by the biological clock and their presence.
Rhythmic periodicity is not just a simple reaction to external cyclical signals. This rhythm has been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate freely for a period even without external cues.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase is one of the main pieces of evidence indicating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of bacteriophages and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the proteins of bacteriophages.
Mutations can have a wide range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the impacted cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are inherited by children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
The natural landscape tourism attracts tourists who are interested in natural areas; they come to see the natural scenery, including wildlife.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town to work, passing by those whose workplaces are exactly where they have left.
In this dynamic traffic interchange, everyone is connected to and supports the traffic system based on private cars in some way.
Nowadays, science shows that this massive carbon economy can no longer keep the biosphere, which has supported human evolution and development for the past 2 million years, in a stable state.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transportation system. And almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints of similar magnitude about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints? Why do they break down every day? Are the traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers often falls within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flow tends to have a certain reasonable consistency, which can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly makes it easier for them to evade predators and more effectively search for food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them more small areas to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believe he is right, but many others hold the opposite view; they believe the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than eight times that of the second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching a width of up to 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the outflow of all rivers in the world.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the grandeur and advanced construction techniques of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Italian is used in Vatican City for legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because these elements can be found in their natural form in the environment and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in no particular order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also proposed a theory that they would transform into new substances, forming the things we see.
An alloy is basically composed of a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget one thing, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals, and naturally, elements like silver and gold are also metals.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metal elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that the period at the end of this sentence can accommodate trillions of atoms.
Therefore, as soon as the pencil came into existence, it became a favorite for many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of pencils has declined, and their use has become less frequent.
People now write messages on computer screens and never have to use pencil sharpeners again.
People can only guess what the fate of the keyboard will be when updated products appear.
The working principle of a fission atomic bomb is as follows: it requires energy to gather an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Split the atomic nucleus again, then release some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to undergo fission with little or no external provocation.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
The crust beneath the dark side is thinner, while the crust under high terrain is thicker.
Because the Earth's crust is thinner, the closer side may have more shaded areas, and lava can more easily rise to the surface.
The core of motivation content theory is to find factors that are recognized or generate interest.
These theories suggest that as people mature to a certain extent and enter adulthood, certain needs and/or desires become internalized.
These theories study why certain people want to do what they do, and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start leading their former colleagues, two types of behavior may occur. One situation is that they will strive to maintain a "close relationship" with team members.
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions and face challenges in enforcing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding individuals accountable.
In another extreme scenario, the person would become an individual distinctly different from before, feeling the need to change everything the team is doing and claiming the results as their own.
After all, the leader bears the ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leader and other team members.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the liaison points with their corresponding offline teams.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their team may schedule meeting times across different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of truly "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"Invisible team" refers to the management team that each member must report to. It sets standards for all members.
Why does it take so long for an organization to build a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional departments of an organization, creativity and originality ensue.
Therefore, an organization often brings about new innovative processes to meet customer needs in the process of working together to overcome obstacles.
Before an organization can innovate, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
"Angel" (2006) interprets the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches in cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can support scientists' research.
We have long known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect human behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and functioning of the brain, which were previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models, helping us to understand the processes of brain functioning.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction flavor, but in fact, it is a very important branch of computer science, which studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The study of artificial intelligence (AI) involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and issues, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial features.
All of these have developed into independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to problems in real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. Some home computer and video game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important part of any educational activity. Generally, teachers are happy to take students to places where buses can't reach.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire exquisite artworks in the classroom.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a good way to review the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often have careless grammar and spelling when they start blogging, the presence of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most critical readers, so bloggers start working hard to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to be more insightful about the world around them." To meet the interests of their audience, students are inspired by this and become smart and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that can inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional classroom teaching.
"Appropriate use of blogs can make students better at analysis and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their stance in the contextual environment of others' articles and are able to put forward their own viewpoints on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, charming and bilingual, featuring a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is the Niagara Falls, while to the north lies the Muskoka River and the undeveloped natural beauty on the opposite bank.
All these factors make Ontario the quintessential image of Canada that outsiders envision.
Further north, the vast areas are sparsely populated, with some places being deserted wilderness.
A set of surprising population data comparisons: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island so far and still a separate continent for wildlife.
The smaller islands are mostly independent countries or belong to France, and they are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and this doctrine is prevalent in the countries of Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The northern part borders the Sahel region; the southern and western parts face the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It is recommended that regardless of actual marital status, all female tourists should say they are married.
Wearing a ring can also help (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviors they consider as harassment; moreover, situations such as being followed or having their arm grabbed are not uncommon.
Be firm when rejecting a man, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, be decisive in refusing!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, and the port was once called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city, naming it Casablanca (Casa Branca), until it was abandoned after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish traders established a trading post here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Near the old town of Medina, shops selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various trinkets can be found everywhere, but these stores are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the easternmost part of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. The lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside Goma should be pre-researched to understand if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province has eased.
This city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for the cheapest gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can tour Goma by taking a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price for a short trip is 500 Congolese Francs.
Also due to its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for a distant foreign land.
Today, although the reputation of Timbuktu has made it a tourist destination, and it has an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, due to the threat of the desert, it was listed as an endangered World Heritage site.
This is an important stop for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
This city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country because it is more Arabic in style rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, supporting various wildlife.
It is one of South Africa’s main attractions and is considered a flagship attraction of the South African National Parks (SANParks) system.
Like all South African national parks, this park charges a daily conservation fee and entrance fee.
Buying a Wild Card has many advantages. With this card, you can enter some parks or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with the Hong Kong area and is also the focal point in the minds of many tourists.
The multitude of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline resembles a glistening bar chart, standing out prominently against the waters of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to appreciate the beauty of Hong Kong from the best angle, you can leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so if you want to find evidence of the colonial history of this territory, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast into both Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest in India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not only mangrove swamps; they also contain remnants of huge jungles that once grew over the Ganges plain.
Sun Debeners covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water/wetland areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that the area is currently home to 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run throughout the day from the city bus station (across the river), but most trips, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that the shuttle bus is often full, it is recommended to purchase tickets several days in advance.
In most areas, you can sit in comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster minibuses.
To travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), shared taxis are a quick and comfortable option.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, the length of the bridge is 378 meters, and there are two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide each.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011 but did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, at which point the Brazilian customs checkpoint is also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They led a semi-nomadic hunting lifestyle and also engaged in self-sufficient agricultural activities.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was known as the "Indian Great Province," a product of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of the native features and characteristics of the city.
Argentina is renowned for having the world's top polo teams and players.
The largest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here.
To learn about tournament news and how to purchase polo match tickets, please visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound, which is equivalent to the British pound.
Currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and in Stanley, you can often pay with credit cards and U.S. dollars.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currency can be used; please contact the landlord in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange it before departing.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; in the summer months, the temperature often exceeds 30°C.
Winter can feel colder than it appears: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but when wind and humidity combine, it feels colder than the thermometer shows.
There is no specific "rainy season" or "dry season" here: the annual rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are, after all, wild animals, and we should not feed or disturb them.
Park officials stated that you should maintain at least a 100-yard/meter distance from bears and wolves, and a 25-yard/meter distance from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they may appear, almost all large animals such as bison, elk, moose, bears, etc., are likely to attack humans.
Each year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
Additionally, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was first established in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
Except for a British cruiser, all other ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle organized by the Mau movement for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the murder of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland spans two harbors, so there are many beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are located in three regions.
North Shore beaches (located within the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It is almost all beach here, swimming is very safe, and most places have the shade of New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located at Waitemata Harbour, right in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with vacationing families, and a variety of shops line the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The main local beer is called "Number One" beer. Its taste is not complicated, but it's very drinkable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
You can buy a lot of French wine here, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might withstand long-distance transport better.
The local tap water fully meets the safety standards for drinking, but if you are still concerned, bottled water is easily available.
For Australians, the concept of "Flat White" coffee is still relatively unfamiliar. A small black coffee is an "espresso," the cream (not foam) on a cappuccino is piled high, and tea is not paired with milk.
Hot chocolate has reached the Belgian standard. The juice is expensive, but the quality is very good.
Many people travel to the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and there are rarely incidents of injury due to participating in any of the aforementioned activities at the Great Barrier Reef.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the relevant authorities, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near the beaches and river mouths of the town of 1770 from October to April each year. Occasionally, they can also be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The primary habitat of saltwater crocodiles is not the ocean but the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers peace of mind, knowing that they have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Although travel agencies may help you book camping and other forms of accommodation, they usually cooperate with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast and round-trip airport transfers, and some even provide flight and hotel accommodation packages.
If you need time to consider whether the price is suitable, or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to travel to the destination, they can hold the reservation for you.
If any modifications or requests are needed, they should first be handled through the travel agent rather than contacting the hotel directly.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider this to be an extremely important part of the festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you need to arrive early and secure a spot near the stage.
Remember, although the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival might continue playing music late into the night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If traveling across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, it's important to check the location of the cabin, because navigating through ice can generate very frightening noise for those most affected.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes city sightseeing activities. Cruise passengers may be exempt from a visa (please refer to the terms of service for details).
Casinos generally try every means to make guests spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos usually have no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and staying at the casino.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high-latitude areas or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On snow-covered roads, the friction is minimal, and you cannot drive as you would on smooth asphalt roads.
During a blizzard, the amount of snowfall in a very short period of time can be enough to trap you.
Snowfall, snowflakes, water droplets, or ice on the car window can also obstruct your view.
On the other hand, snowy and icy weather is very common in many countries, and transportation is hardly disrupted throughout the year.
Safari tours may be the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and also a highlight for many travelers.
The term "safari" in its common usage refers to traveling by land to observe amazing African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) tend to like getting close to cars, and standard equipment allows people to better appreciate them.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are afraid of humans, and you can see them more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "jungle trekking," "trekking trips," or "hiking") mainly involves walking on foot, usually taking several hours or lasting several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies introduced due to the coronavirus have not been extended to July 2020—the originally scheduled time for the Olympics.
Ticket prices for most events are expected to range between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with the average price being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Even if the room does not have an iron and ironing board, many hotels offer lending services.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer (if you have one).
Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (this may cause shrinkage and, in extreme cases, scorch the clothes).
There are many methods of purifying water, some of which are more effective for specific pollutants.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in other areas it takes a few minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have concerns about this, you should consider purchasing sealed bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers might encounter harmful animals that are not commonly seen in their hometown.
Pests can damage food, cause irritant reactions, in more severe cases cause allergic reactions, and spread venom or infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of violently harming humans, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase tax-free goods at specific locations.
Travelers going to countries/regions with onerous taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, as buying products such as alcohol and tobacco in these places is particularly cost-effective.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, the most challenging driving conditions are on the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which frequently passes through several remote and secluded areas.
If you're not accustomed to driving on rural roads, you'd better stay alert: there are steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns everywhere.
The speed limit posted in this area is significantly lower than the preceding and succeeding stretches, with common limits being 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), and the importance of strictly adhering to the speed limit is greater here than on other sections.
However, what is surprising is that the cell phone service here is much stronger than many other routes along the way, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
The pastries in Germany are quite good, and those in Bavaria are even more diverse, much like their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are very common, apples can be used to make desserts all year round, and in summer you can also enjoy cherries and plums.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair perfectly with strong coffee.
If you want some rich-flavored snacks, you can try jam-filled buns. This dessert is called by different names in different regions, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, Krapfen.
Curry rice is a dish that features herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
Curry dishes can be "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of water used.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry; whereas in the southern part of India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is merely a general term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional modifiers, the term often refers to food native to the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine can be found everywhere on the archipelago, including many dishes prepared with simple seasoning methods. The main seasonings favored by the Javanese include peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
Stirrups hang on either side of the saddle to support the rider’s feet.
They provide better stability for riders, but there is also a safety risk because the rider's foot may get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from the horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, the horse may drag them while running. To minimize this risk, some preventive measures can be taken.
First, most horse riders wear heeled riding boots with smooth and relatively narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles - especially English saddles - are equipped with safety buckles, so if the rider falls backward, the stirrup leathers will come off the saddle.
The Cochamó Valley, a top mountaineering destination in Chile, is known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring a variety of granite walls and cliffs.
From the mountain peak, there is a breathtaking magnificent view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly pioneering new routes on its continuous sheer cliffs that can be used as climbing walls.
Alpine skiing includes traditional skiing and snowboarding, and it is a very popular sport where skis or a snowboard are attached to your feet as you glide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main tourist activity for many ski enthusiasts, who are sometimes referred to as "ski fanatics," and they plan to spend the entire holiday skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time—cave paintings depicting skiers can be traced back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This activity is related to alpine skiing trips or mountaineering, but these two activities are not usually undertaken. Both activities take place on steep terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
When conditions are favorable, you can go farther than walking—but only in very rare cases can you achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing on a smooth track without carrying a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small area but many independent countries. Typically, traveling across multiple countries means having to go through visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
However, in this regard, the Schengen Area is somewhat like a single country.
As long as you reside in this area, you can usually cross the border directly without going through the passport checkpoint again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa from each Schengen member country separately, thereby saving time, money, and formalities.
There is no uniform definition of which processed items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies by region, with the year limit in places like North America potentially being shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, although compared to their mass-produced counterparts, the age of handicrafts is much shorter.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people. The culture surrounding this industry is also important to many people who make a living in other professions.
However, even in the traditional sense, not all Sami people are involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry; they make a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and usually use reindeer as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people are engaged in modern industries. Tourism is a major source of income for Sápmi, which is the Sami region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you plan to visit is under a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments besides your own country, but their advice is formulated for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories can only provide a brief summary of the local situation.
Compared to the more detailed information provided elsewhere, the advice offered here is often rather rough, general, and overly simplistic.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon; this type of weather can cause damage, serious social disruption, or casualties.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world. There are various types of severe weather, depending on geographic location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, wildfires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones, all represent and impact extreme weather.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms, among others.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the adverse weather risks at their location, as they may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Search "Hostile Environment Training Course" on the internet, and you might find the addresses of local companies offering training.
This course typically covers all the issues discussed here, often delving deeply through practical experience.
The course training usually lasts for 2-5 days, involving role-playing, first aid training, and sometimes armed training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about surviving in war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid documents upon their return.
As for whether or not they are willing to issue a passport without specifying gender (X), or willing to change documents to reflect the desired name and gender, the willingness of governments varies from country to country.
The level of recognition of these documents by foreign governments varies greatly.
In the post-September 11, 2001 era, searches at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery have to reveal their privacy when passing through scanners, and their dignity cannot be guaranteed.
A rip current is a fast-flowing backwash from the beach back to the sea, usually occurring at reefs or similar places.
The underwater terrain causes the backflow to concentrate in several deeper areas, where currents towards deep water may form.
Most deaths are caused by swimming against the current and exhausting physical strength; swimming against the flow is unlikely to succeed.
After breaking free from the rushing water, swimming back was not as difficult.
Strive to swim to a place where you won't be trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you have been discovered).
The impact of returning home comes faster than culture shock (with a shorter honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can potentially be more severe.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it can sometimes be difficult to readjust to their native culture.
After living abroad for a while and returning to your home country, you'll find that you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits from your hometown culture.
When you first go abroad, people may be very patient and considerate because they know travelers need to adapt when arriving in a new country.
People might not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding on their return journey.
For children, the sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and before the show starts, you can see them quietly there.
Normally, you can always hear the sounds of tourists and street vendors here. The interplay of sound and light is like telling a moving story.
On the backdrop is the Sphinx, which is also the narrator of the long story.
The scene is displayed on the pyramids, with different pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several countries claim sovereignty over the islands, and the archipelago has the most bases, with sixteen bases in operation on the islands in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of "Villa Las Estrellas" is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still-active volcanic crater has been flooded, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountain range on the peninsula merges into the plateau here and then re-forms into the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern area, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where cell phone signal is unavailable, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Generally speaking, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because calls can only be made outdoors where the satellite signal is unobstructed.
The service is frequently used for shipping, including yachts and expeditions with remote data and voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide detailed information about connecting to this service.
For those planning how to spend their gap year, study tours are becoming an increasingly popular choice.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, who can take a year off before going to college without affecting their education.
In many cases, participating in a gap year program abroad can substantially enhance your opportunities for further education upon returning to your home country.
Usually, participating in these educational programs requires paying tuition.
Finland is an excellent sailing destination, known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," and within its lakes and coastal archipelagos, there are also thousands of islands.
Yachts are not essential among the archipelagos and lakes.
The size of the coastal islands and the largest lakes is sufficient to accommodate any yacht, though smaller boats or even kayaks can offer a different experience.
Rowing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand also have similar situations, but they are quite unique in other aspects (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one in forty).
Most typical Baltic cruises will stay for an extended period in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means having several full days to explore this historic city and then returning to the ship to sleep at night.
If landing ashore only occurs during a boat tour, a separate visa is not required (regulation valid as of 2009).
Some cruise ships highlight Berlin, Germany in their promotional brochures. As seen from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the cruise prices do not include the cost of touring the city.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially for those who have never flown before or have had distressing experiences.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and loathing that many people have towards other things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and the procedures of flying may help overcome the fear that arises from unknown things or situations beyond their control.
Courier companies can receive high compensation for quickly delivering goods. Often, time is crucial for business documents, products, or parts used for emergency repairs.
On certain routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it's a problem.
If they use air freight to transport goods, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on certain routes.
The fastest way is to check it as checked luggage. According to airline regulations, carrying luggage for passengers who have not boarded is prohibited, and at this point, you need to be present.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a lot of money enjoying this privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for your seat).
However, this is not cheap: according to rough estimates, the ticket price for business class may be 4 times that of regular economy class, and the ticket price for first class is as much as 11 times higher!
Generally speaking, when flying directly from place A to place B, there's really no need to look for discounted business class or first class tickets.
Airlines are well aware that there are some core passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, so airlines charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two regions of Moldova have been rebuilt.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodoxy.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million. It is the second largest port in Turkey, only after Istanbul, and it is also a busy transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it has now become a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, surrounded by a vast bay and mountains.
Among the wide, tree-lined avenues, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers, there are traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, as well as ancient mosques and churches. However, this city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.

Please remember, you are actually visiting a massive mass grave site, which holds immeasurable significance for a large group of people in the world.
There are still many men and women who survived here and are still alive today; while many more had relatives who were either slaughtered there or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please accord this place the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about genocide or Nazis.
Do not mark or graffiti on buildings to avoid damaging the site.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, and the vast majority understand Catalan. As for Spanish, almost everyone can understand it.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is the legally required first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
The regular announcements in the subway are only in Catalan, but the automated system makes temporary announcements in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are notoriously self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is still to behave properly and act like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will make participating in social activities much easier.
If you show a little basic courtesy, the rudeness of Parisians will quickly disappear without a trace.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, with the main tree species being beech, spruce, and fir, characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diversity of microclimates, soil, and altitude, the plant communities here are very diverse and renowned worldwide.
The area is also home to various kinds of animals and birds.
Rare animals such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies can be seen there, along with many more common species.
Women must wear skirts when visiting the monastery, and the skirts must be knee-length, with shoulders also covered.
Most monasteries will provide robes for unprepared women, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, the monk at the entrance will give you a slight smile.
Similarly, men must also wear long pants to cover their knees.
You can also borrow them from the lockers at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed every time after someone wears them, so these dresses might feel a bit uncomfortable to wear. They are all one-size-fits-all!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is mainly based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and makes full use of olive oil.
Pa amb Oli is a simple dinner especially popular in summer: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns except for the word "Sie" should be capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method for distinguishing certain verbs and objects.
This can also make reading easier, although it complicates writing to some extent because you need to determine whether verbs or adjectives are used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation of Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly the same as they are spelled.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes according to the following vowels.

Therefore, reading this grammar introductory book can help you master more Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
There is no doubt that if you speak a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, someone who knows a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is very similar to Spanish and doesn't need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, most pre-modern observatories have been phased out and are preserved only as museums or educational venues.
During its heyday, light pollution was not as severe as it is now, so observatories were usually built within urban areas or campuses, making them more accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are giant facilities located in remote areas with excellent atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as "hanami," has been a Japanese tradition since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, and plums are a type of flower that is well-loved by Chinese people.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom party was hosted by the Emperor for himself and other members of the royal family at the Imperial Palace.
Plants are in their best state in the natural environment. Therefore, resist the temptation to pick plants, even if it's "just one."
If you are visiting a meticulously arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also lead to expulsion, with no room for negotiation.
Generally speaking, Singapore is a very safe place and easy to navigate. You can find almost anything you need once you arrive.
However, being a few degrees north of the equator in the "high tropics," you will need to contend with high temperatures (year-round) and intense sunlight (relatively less so when the weather is clear).
There are several buses heading north to Hebron, where the traditional graves of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are located.
Please confirm that the bus you intend to take will go into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can make for a great holiday theme.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to explore the fun cities along the Danube River, or enjoy a boat trip along the Erie Canal.

Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity, established to celebrate the birth of Christ.
Many of the traditions associated with this festival have also been embraced by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake outdoors somewhere on Easter night to watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has its Christian theological explanations, but it is very likely that it existed as a celebration of spring and a prayer for a good harvest before the birth of Christ.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigil services on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with the congregation usually pouring into the celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
Initially, the animals reached these islands by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Because of their distance from the mainland, mammals are unable to make the long journey, making giant tortoises the primary herbivores of the Galápagos Islands.
After humans arrived in the Galápagos Islands, they introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, a period during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides an excellent opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark for the entire day continuously.
These areas are sparsely populated and generally do not have issues with light pollution, allowing you to enjoy a brilliant starry sky.
Compared to the work culture accustomed to by Westerners, the hierarchical system in Japanese work culture is more pronounced and formal.
A suit is the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or titles.
A harmonious workplace atmosphere is crucial, emphasizing team effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees must obtain approval from their superiors when making any decisions and must unconditionally comply with the instructions of their superiors.
