The statement is not completely clear in Buginese, but it can be interpreted as trying to describe an observation about people, possibly young women or youth, who do not focus on schooling or academics on the outside but instead focus on enhancements internally or aesthetically, which is somehow related to carotenoids in the body.

The dinosaur is believed not to have strong structures in its back feathers, which were feather spines, even though the features of the feather - barbs and barbules - are there. This indicates, according to researchers, that the evolution of these spines should have occurred after the feathers had already evolved.
The head shape indicates that it does not function when submerged because it regulates temperature and sense perception. Many researchers suggest that its function is mostly for display. For instance, the head is large and stable with children's heads.
According to the research, this is probably a young dinosaur, like those with large heads and small bodies.
