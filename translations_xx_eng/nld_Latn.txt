The American Olympic Committee has the support of USA Gymnastics and understands that it is necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe place for all athletes.
We align with the USOC's statement that it is best for our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to implement meaningful changes within our organization rather than withdrawing certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can provide more clarity on how abuse on this scale, so bravely described by the victims of Larry Nassar, could go unnoticed for so long, and embraces all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to ensure that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment by making gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible.

This not only proves the already widespread theory that in any case certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but they do possess other characteristics of feathers - such as barbs.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or for appearance. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this specimen actually shows mature feathers and therefore not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite it being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

The grievances within the community resulted in the current attempts to establish a policy regarding the sexual content of the site that hosts millions of pieces of media content under an open license.
The completed work was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program is written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
Comparable to how the moon exerts force on the earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around it, in a kind of ring, and consists of a large amount of smaller particles.

During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are actually warmer.
"The thermal behavior of this is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a temperature that is fairly constant. What is consistent is that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, traditionally, little technology is needed for voting: voters enter a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope indicating which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first verify the identity of the voter. Then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then signs under the voting list.
The process is relatively precisely defined in the electoral law of France.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that both voters and observers can see that at the start of the voting there are no envelopes in them and that no other envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

In the other event she participated in, the sitting Giant Slalom, she finished tenth among the women, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That is 2:11:60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's group for the seated slalom could not finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been recovered by the Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the rapists of the Swedish woman have been arrested and they have found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit it, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver did sustain serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services attempted to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to Great Yarmouth, in the James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting the charges and the trial, but the eyewitness account may be tainted because her story has been extensively published.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos, etc., of suspects.'
Crown Office has overall responsibility for prosecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges are filed.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians have wanted based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics that were discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, a city that is holy to both peoples, and the issues in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years following the signing of an agreement. However, the PA is only willing to agree to a presence of five years.
Shooters in the supplementary trial for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest rangers. The trial was, in fact, followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director for Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters for the first shooting operation have had extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a nine-member new Provisional Electoral Council (Provisional Electoral Council of CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous National Electoral Council. This is part of a package of measures to bring about new elections in the country.
The commission was established by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have been taking place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose due to the lack of elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods that are overheating have been reported. In total, this led to six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as 'not serious'.
"Very regrettable," was the ministry's reaction to the fact that Apple has postponed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands declared that no damage has been reported nationwide.
Additionally, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and so far at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was eventually shot.

Trained as a midwife, he started working in 1959 at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
When he was working in the hospital, Liggins conducted research on premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lung development in babies was accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua has reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels indicated that 'Luna was just as weird as I am... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully, she’s in a better place'.
Of the 1400 people who were surveyed for the federal election of 2010, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this poll supported this position. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of respondents thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end, 31 percent said that should never happen.
The Olympic gold medal winner swam the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay races during the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to alleviate his pain because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number at the moment on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source that brought water to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into how planets are formed. They are particularly eager to understand how Earth was formed, considering it has been a very long time since comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors 'political nonsense and gossip'.
It is speculated that he wants to run for the presidency in 2016.
With the NextGen system, planes could take shorter routes according to the FAA, which could save millions of tons of fuel annually for reduced carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technologies with ground radars, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better and providing pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport will be deployed and no surface trains will stop at Wembley; in addition, the parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on the site.
A possible lack of transport increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossing of a native Darwin's finch, the Medium Ground Finch, with an immigrant Cactus Finch, the Española Ground Finch, took longer.
Gold can be worked into many shapes. It can be rolled up into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into sheets.
After it is made very thin, it can be adhered to another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the embellishment of hand-painted illustrations in books known as 'illuminated manuscripts.'
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You are already making an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Next, the color of the cabbage juice changes based on the acidity (acidic to basic or alkaline) of the chemical substance.
Based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance that was tested, the pH value is indicated.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands, and form a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewer remnants have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, there were already toilets in China, Egypt, and Persia in ancient times. For example, in the era of the Romans, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both ladies and gentlemen gathered together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is sent back immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and images.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need to have an enormous rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as stray cats kept as pets) that hunt larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special role that each cat has, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also include up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves almost the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) and that are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and has five times the pulling power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger does not roar with full force like a lion. It's more as if it growls a whole sentence.
The favorite meal of ocelots is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively for animals that are much smaller than itself.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move very discreetly. Ocelots hunt prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the large population they originate from (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different enemies are present, so the new population must adopt a different stance or adapt to be able to face the competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to resemble the other population less and less.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have become so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply involves the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Through photosynthesis, the plants obtain their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothing are made from plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain of that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone, except from other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning that nothing and no one could escape him.
It is not certain, but possibly his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even its own kind.
In bodies of water, nothing was safe from the attacks; even gigantic dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although the majority of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Additionally, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs during meals, but rich men preferred to hold banquets where they lounged on their sides while eating.
Meals from the Roman antiquity did not contain any food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cacao. Moreover, no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the own house of that god.
Offerings were made to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a public courtyard and a rear hall that was accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers in the form of pyramids were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family largely took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland still had few inhabitants. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way westward, and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, customs, and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway were very different from each other.
You might think after watching the movie National Treasure that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is based on a misconception. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage in the past.
It therefore seems that the designation has simply been added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was governed by Vichy France. These were French who in 1940 sided with the Germans and thus collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated Southern France in just two weeks. Then they went on to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which in turn stands for citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of the society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down over multiple generations, leaving a lasting cultural footprint and balanced dissemination.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind. As a result, they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of a congress.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judiciary, and it relied on state authorities to carry out all decisions, who often were unwilling to cooperate.
Nor did it have the authority to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
First, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government very seriously, which often resulted in their representatives being absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest island). This makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often geographically referred to as a 'peninsula'.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe passed by the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in the southwest of Taiwan as a base of operations, where the VOC tackled the indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Composed of three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists get a better idea of how they looked before.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
For example, worldwide, the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analog film era.
These are still being produced to this day, although it is mainly the aspect ratio of the image that was adopted by the digital camera's image sensor.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, with a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) would in that case be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS-like formats) are identical to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and found ridiculous by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also clear.
The most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This is how you divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states, despite language differences and differences in customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervasive power influenced everyone.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and for this reason, the church has financial resources.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to begin questioning whether this principle was being observed.
Great Britain established a naval blockade against Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to deliver vital supplies to military personnel and civilians. However, this blockade did violate the widely accepted international law established in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail in large parts of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolationism.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States of America to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison with him.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Also between the various dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most well-known was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During that time, fierce wars took place between various nobles who were fighting for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is recorded as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had significant social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the notion that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
After the revolution, positions were available for all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same goes for the army. Military ranks are no longer based on someone's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to a revolution.
Mohammed was intensely engaged with supernatural matters. He often went for contemplation to a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountain of Noor.
The cave itself, which has withstood the ravages of time, provides a very vivid image of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the northern side of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave, total isolation prevails.
The only thing visible are the bright, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the many large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian valley of the dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), multiple small tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed as tributes to the wives and family members of Khufu.
The up-bow symbol looks like a V and the down-bow symbol looks like a staple or a small square missing the bottom.
Above means you should start at the tip and push the bow away. Below means you should start at the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty to sketch your personal markings, but do not forget that the printed articulation marks are there for a musical reason, which means they usually must be respected.
A group of market women sat on October 6, 1789, after the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by howling and threatening mobs that menaced the royal couple.
Due to the actions of the crowd, the king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At a certain moment, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
The costs of the U.S. imperialism war concerning the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the population of the Philippines.
They were imposed by the American colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the costs, and the interest on bonds was issued via the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism largely relied on the enormous profit from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that prompted the formation of the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the Early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages. These were then followed by the Late Middle Ages, which typically end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from the supply of technology or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism hold these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that largely extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is economically unfeasible for just a few cars. That is why new production methods are being developed, so that the costs of car ownership can be reduced.
The massive car ownership also leads to a greater number of road accidents, and this results in the development of new healthcare techniques to repair the human body.
In Romanticism, a large part of cultural determinism was included, which originated from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures emerged as a result of this geography. These formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is the current fashion capital.
From around 400 AD to about 1100 AD, it was known as an epicenter of luxury.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic architecture flourished in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a unique style began to emerge in Western Europe. One of the greatest developments was the result of the Crusades: people started using buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture in which enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system that is usually organic. It involves the use of stored seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture. In many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures ensure that like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms are brought together. This gives them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves through the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, how they behave, and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization were the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, adversity, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Unmanageable children may have experienced serious child abuse or a severe trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
It is claimed of others that they were raised by animals, and of some it is said that they lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child that is not raised by humans may display behavior similar to that of the animal that cared for the child (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or those starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. A teacher, for example, is a form of support, but the Microsoft Office paperclip man is that as well.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids, and explains procedures that might be difficult for students to understand without assistance.
There are several reasons why children enter foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared about, and where they cannot develop, but still this happens.
We consider the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
The aim is for foster care to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
In foster care, all needs must be met that were neglected in the previous home.
On the internet, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The different characteristics of the internet lead to new dimensions regarding the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
'Learning' and 'socialization' are, for example, proposed as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that no one can recognize a lie simply by paying attention to micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how it is possible that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has revealed that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation; selection eliminates this variation from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, variation occurs between the two groups through separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can hardly obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant sources found on the savanna.
Furthermore, failure to take it into consideration can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately even death.
The most easily found plant sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that include all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and that you fall asleep again within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively gentle alarm that brings you back to consciousness without immediately becoming fully awake.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way, you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking lots of fluids before going to sleep (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic). This will make you have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person has is opposed to the amount of stress someone carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every person is capable of attaining contentment and total peace.
Everyone can enlighten their mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism is expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditating, and a practice of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is awakened.

Because Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, a collaboration between the USSR and the USA was established. When the war was over, conflicts between system, process, and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies stood directly opposed to each other two years after the end of the war; this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last for 40 years, and battles with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held out only until September 17, 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were outdated in one night when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland. This was in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ship is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the task of the navy to ensure that a country retains the capability to transport people and goods, while the enemy's ability to transport people and goods is specifically hindered.
The US tried to get troops and material across the Atlantic Ocean to the British, and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII, it is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German navy simultaneously attempted to intercept this traffic using primarily U-boats.
Just like the rest of Europe, Great Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It appears that the goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began keeping them so they could always easily access their hair, meat, milk, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then watched over by goat herders, much like the more well-known shepherd, often a child or young person. Today, herding is still done in the same way.
As early as the 16th century, horse-drawn railways were being built in England.
Although horse railways consisted only of plank rails, the horses had to run increasingly faster and pull larger loads than on the somewhat difficult-to-navigate roads of that time.
Crossbeams were used fairly early on to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This quickly became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were laid.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus emerged (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
In fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, bipedal specializations are found. By the way, the Sahelanthropus might have also walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement, or even campaign to somewhat alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, it is something like a symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and eliminate it.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly radically changed the Earth. Moreover, overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few streets away. This draft was signed by the President of the Continental Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon gave the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a species of dinosaur alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind one of a dinosaur.
On their legs are claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
The manipulation of data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
This group of insects is formally called 'bugs' by entomologists.
This term originates from an age-old agreement with bedbugs, which are insects that are very good at parasitizing humans.
Both red assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest-bound, having adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This includes the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to put their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the primary goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
Yet it is about more than just experiments; an experiment is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to question them and make observations, as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and particularly on the Bible in Latin.
The positions of Aristotle regarding science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less because the knowledge of Greek diminished.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not merely reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that run through a cycle for a specific period of time, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted. In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was labeled with a radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the protein of the phage was labeled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the involved genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or can lead to cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On site, one can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, visit parks, and study the ecosystem, among other things.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small villages drive their cars to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village they just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that due to this enormous carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in the stable state that allowed human evolution to occur over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare in comparison.
Why is it that so many complaints arise with transport systems, why does it go wrong every day? Are transport technicians just incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
In a traffic flow, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between the individuals are examined.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably. This means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this in mathematical terms.
Connections have been made between the three core characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
With the help of these relationships, the planning, designing, and operation of road construction facilities is facilitated.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could more easily escape from enemies and more efficiently find food and mating partners.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a greater number of small places.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were indeed people who thought he was correct, but many people believed the exact opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This sounds fairly logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river, carrying more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and is six miles wide in some places.
At least 20% of all the water that flows into the sea through rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old at the time.
Approximately 800 people live in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the entire world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the official language for the communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is frequently used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because these are all found in nature and it is relatively easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more similar to what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are, simply put, a combination of at least two metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under metals. There are, of course, also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example, carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles that are called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful friend to many people when it was launched.
The pen, as newer writing methods have emerged, has unfortunately declined in status and is used much less.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You may wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
As if you are pushing a heavy cart up a hill. If the core is split again, a part of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they fall apart at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outermost layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There might be more craters on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could reach the surface more easily there.
Content theories aim to discover what motivates people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they grow into adulthood.
With these theories, they aim to investigate the reasons why certain people want certain things and which environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene theory.
In general, two approaches emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. In one approach, they try to present themselves as equals.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary measures, conduct evaluation interviews, delegate, and hold people accountable for their responsibilities.
On the other end of the spectrum, this person transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she feels the need to change everything the team has done so far and wants to make everything their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
Often they are more independent than traditional team members. This is because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to embark on the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness come to light when all available resources are effectively utilized within the functional departments of an organization.
The result of this is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organization, management must encourage a culture where innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. This allows the research area to be narrowed down and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists during their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, wounds, and tumors can influence behavior and lead to changes in mental capacity.
Because there are more and more new technologies, we are increasingly learning about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately makes most people think of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior falls under AI research.
Some examples are management, planning, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer inquiries, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Nowadays, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical, and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
For each class, many excursions are planned. Often, a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological advancements, virtual excursions are now possible. With this, students can view artifacts in a museum, look inside an aquarium, or see beautiful artworks from the classroom.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a fantastic way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned annually and previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students to write better. Often, their grammar and spelling are poor at first, but this quickly changes because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and thus avoid criticism.
By blogging, 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used effectively, blogs can help students develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in discussions on the internet, students can find their own place in the context of others' material and simultaneously determine their own stance on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums where Canada is showcased in the past and the future.
Further south, you will find the Niagara Falls. In the north, you will find the beautiful unspoiled Muskoka and more.
These kinds of things make Ontario appear typically Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Further north, large areas are quite sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna, it is almost a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands consist of independent countries or are connected with France, and they are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west and the Sahel region to the north.
Women: female travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether it is true or not.
It also helps to wear rings (not too expensive-looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behavior they perceive as intimidating, and that it is common to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when rejecting a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not excuse this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids and was known under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina, you'll find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, hookahs, and other knick-knacks, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano spewed lava and most of the streets of the city, particularly the city center, were buried.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside Goma, you should check the current situation regarding the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers some of the most affordable trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With a boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi), you can get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
'Timbuktu' is relatively inaccessible and is therefore nowadays used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although the city's reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the most important stops of the PBS exhibition Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country because it has a more Arabic appearance than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, running along the eastern border with Mozambique, the northern border with Zimbabwe, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometers in size, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the showpiece of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and access costs apply.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card. These provide access either to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is considered the main place by many tourists.
The large number of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar chart made visible by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across the way.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's population lives very close together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, you can start well here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch from the coast 80 km (50 miles) into the Indian and Bengali interior.
The Sundarbans have now been officially included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are more than just mangrove swamps — they also contain some of the last mighty pieces of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one third is peatland and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and the area is now estimated to contain 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m., especially towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as the regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses run, which are comfortable and robust.
With shared taxis, one can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque with the French Guiana city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge, the clearance height is 15 meters. In August 2011, the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened for traffic in March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. The Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use by then.
The Guaraní were the most notable indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence farming.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes lived, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly also known as 'the great province of India,' originated in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
This was followed by a three-century-long period of colonization under the Spaniards.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). Its value is approximately equal to one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, there is only one bank, namely in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but you can likely pay with British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Exchange your money back before you leave the islands, because Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange elsewhere.
Montevideo is located below the equator, so when it is summer there, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures easily exceed +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never drops below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains approximately the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately still just wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
In the park, keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
Moose, bison, reindeer, bears, and just about all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Moreover, you should be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with nearly 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850, Apia was founded and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US, and Great Britain did not want to leave the harbor. This later became known as the notorious stalemate.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died at a non-violent gathering in the city that got out of hand.
There are many beaches, mainly because of the two harbors of Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
At Waitemata's harbor, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is named 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might be better suited for traveling.
The local drinking water can be safely consumed, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
Trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries resulting from these reef trips are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and river mouths north of Town of 1770. Sometimes they also occur outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. The majority of sharks are afraid of humans and would actually swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Making a reservation in advance ensures peace of mind for the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually also book other types of accommodations, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think a bit longer about the offer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do this through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, it is the case that the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
And remember the following: even when the music on the main stages is over, music might still be played in other parts of the festival grounds until the small hours.
For families with young children, there are special camping sites at some festivals.
Pay attention to where your cabin is when you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the journey through the ice makes an enormous noise if you sit too close.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos generally aim to make the most out of the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exit can sometimes be hard to find.
They usually have special offers in the areas of food, drink, and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic drinks. However, when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you go high up into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you should take into account that there may be snow or ice, and the temperature can be incredibly low.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and this makes driving different from on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period to get stuck.
Visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic there.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa are safaris, which for many visitors represent the highlight of their trip.
The term safari popularly refers to traveling overland to view the magnificent African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment allows for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs, and leopards, you need binoculars. Otherwise, the chance of seeing them is small.
A walking safari (also known as a 'bush walk' or 'loop safari') means that you walk for several hours or days in succession.
The Paralympics are from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events are held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympic Games have taken place twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
According to expectations, most tickets for events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000. Regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
If no iron is available or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer, if available.
Make sure the fabric doesn't get too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
You can purify water in different ways. Some methods are effective in countering specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in other areas, water needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal infestations that do not exist in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that injure or kill people by force are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can purchase goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers going to countries with high excise taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money when it comes to products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected via the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, you often drive through deserted backcountry, making this route one big challenge.
Are you not used to driving on country roads? Then stay alert. You will encounter many steep hills, narrow streets, and sharp turns.
The set speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent areas — usually about 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it's even more important to adhere to them here than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, you have much more coverage here than in other remote parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great and in Bavaria, the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of the southern neighbor, Austria.
You see many fruit pastries. Throughout the year, the pastries contain apples, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a few small but mighty pastries, then try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in the region.
To make a curry, you need spicy and hot ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the inland areas of North India and also of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead.
The Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the entire archipelago and offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also bring safety issues as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but gets their foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been implemented.
Most riders primarily wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, particularly English saddles, are equipped with safety stirrups. This allows a stirrup leather to detach from the saddle when it is pulled backward if a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all parts of the world continuously discover new routes on the rock faces, which seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports involving descending, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as 'ski bums', who plan entire holidays around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginning of skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also known as off-piste skiing, skitouring, or skihiking.
It is not exactly the same, but it resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, which are often done on steep terrain. You need much stiffer skis and boots for this.
You can see the ski route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover greater distances than by walking, but it rarely happens that you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for a visa multiple times and undergo passport controls.
However, the Schengen Area functions almost as one country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition indicating which produced items are considered antique. Some tax offices define goods older than 100 years as antique.
The definition may vary by location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to classify artisanal products as antiques, even though they are newer than comparable mass-produced items.
Among the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood. The culture surrounding trade is also very important for many with other occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding. They sustained themselves with fishing, hunting, and similar activities. In this, reindeer were mostly used as draught animals.
Many Sámi today work in modern professions. In Sápmi, the Sámi region, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma. However, it is also often considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If there is a travel advisory for the country you wish to visit, this may have implications for your health insurance during the trip or your cancellation insurance.
You can consult the advice of other governments in addition to the advice of your own government. However, their advice is directed towards their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice includes only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often provide a fleeting, general, and extremely simplistic picture compared to other, more detailed sources.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption, or the loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Phenomena and consequences of severe weather include strong winds, hail, large amounts of precipitation, and wildfires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms are, among others, examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions in their area can entail, as these may also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
An internet search for 'course in hostile environments' will likely provide the address of a local company.
In a course, all the issues outlined here are normally addressed in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role plays, a lot of first aid and occasionally weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about surviving in the wilderness. However, there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers who have planned gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for their return journey.
It varies greatly whether governments are willing to issue passports on which no gender (X) is indicated, or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Searches at security checks have also become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they will not pass through this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break over a reef or something similar and wash up on the beach.
Due to the underwater topology, the return current is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current. This might just be impossible.
Once you've escaped the strong current, swimming back is a breeze.
Try to focus on a place where you won't get caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have less of a 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have difficulty readapting to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then return, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some customs from your own culture in the process.
In the past, when you traveled abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Usually, it is not expected that patience and understanding are needed for travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is among the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in complete silence before the show begins.
Often, the sound of sellers and tourists is always audible here. The story of the light and sound is similar to that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projections on the pyramids, and the rest of the pyramids are highlighted.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by various countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula transition into the plateau, only to re-emerge to form the 360 km long Mount Ellsworth range, which is traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is, at 4,892 meters, the highest mountain.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to stand outside with a clear view of the satellite to be able to make a call.
This service is often used by the shipping industry, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
Your local telephone provider can give you more information on how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people to plan a gap year to travel and learn.
Especially school leavers make use of this to take a gap year before university without any adverse effects on their education.
Often, enrolling in a program abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of pursuing higher education again in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees must be paid for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos along the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak, you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg (Russia).
This way, you can spend several full days in the historic site and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you disembark only during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different than many fears that other people also have.
If you know how airplanes work, this can help dispel a fear originating from the unknown or the fact that you have no control over the airplane.
Courier companies receive a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could deploy their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they send things by air transport, it can take days on some routes before they are unloaded and clear customs.
Only as checked baggage could this be processed faster. According to airline regulations, there must then be a corresponding passenger and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a bundle of money for this privilege (or better yet, have your employer do it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times the economy class fare for business class, and about eleven times for first class.
Generally, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business-class or first-class tickets for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly quickly and comfortably somewhere, and the airlines accordingly charge matching costs for this.
Chișinău is the capital of Moldova. The Romanian language is mainly spoken here, but the Russian language is also common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova suffered under an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the political negotiations having failed.
Orthodox Christian is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul, and a good transportation hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The broad boulevards, the glass buildings, and the modern shopping centers covered with red roof tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditionally Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a unique church with eight corners.
A number of graves by the church feature fascinating marble dove sculptures.
If you have half an hour to spare, you should definitely take a look around this village.
In the north, you'll find the easily accessible, romantic, and fascinating place Sintra. Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron spoke with praise about the beautiful monuments there.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stopover at Cabo da Roca.
Also go north and visit the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally known Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember that you are essentially just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that holds an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world population.
Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many of them have loved ones who were murdered there or worked themselves to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Show all applicable respect, solemnity, and dignity during your visit. Do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by applying markings or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
Nevertheless, most signs are in Catalan, because according to the law, that is the first official language.
Spanish is frequently spoken on public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are done by an automated system in various languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English, and also Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known as selfish, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave as someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-mannered). This will make exploring Paris much easier.
The hard exterior of Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, and this forested area mainly consists of beeches, firs, and pines, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are particularly many different plant communities due to the different microclimates, soil types, and varying altitude differences.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
There are rare animals like the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat, and the capercaillie to be found, alongside all sorts of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt that falls below the knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually, as a woman, you are given a shawl if you arrive unprepared at a monastery, but if you bring your own, with nice loud colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you kindly.
On the other hand, men must wear trousers that extend at least over the knees.
You can also borrow these from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
Just like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner dish, mainly during the summer months, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and whatever seasonings are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, just like Sie which means you, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
In this way, you make a significant distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier. Nevertheless, writing is more complicated because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation generally poses few problems.
You must pay the most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation of those is actually dependent on the vowel that follows.
You also have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and generally regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar will teach you a lot about Persian grammar and help you understand sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese resembles it so much that you don't need to learn it separately.
Premodern observatories are now obsolete and serve as museums or educational attractions.
At that time, light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities that are built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms and has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers, and the concept originated there.
The first cherry blossom festivals of Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look their best in a natural environment, which is why you should resist the urge to remove even 'just one' species.
If you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be immediately and without discussion denied access to the garden.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate, and virtually everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics', just a few degrees on the north side of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and powerful sun (when the sky is clear, which is less often).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you take actually goes into Hebron and doesn't just drive to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
People who are not believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide have also adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up all night on Easter until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Naturally enough, there are Christian theological explanations to be found for this tradition, but it could just as easily be about a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend. Here, the congregations often celebrate a feast in honor of the resurrection of Christ at the stroke of midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey. As a result, the giant tortoise became the most common grazing mammal on the Galápagos Islands.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, various mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During the winter, the polar night occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you will be able to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not often a problem. That means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Suits are standard work attire and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Unity in the workplace is crucial. The focus is on group performance rather than praising individual work achievements.
Employees often need to obtain permission from their supervisors before they can make a decision, and they are expected to follow the supervisors' instructions mindlessly.
