This is the confirmation that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already common, and it gives details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists have said that the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown on the upper part with a lower part that is white or carrot-colored.
The discovery also provides information on the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft, called rachis, but they have other feather characteristics, barbs, and barbules, which led researchers to deduce that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development that occurred after these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating or displaying temperature. The researchers have suggested that, although this is the nest of a young dinosaur, the specimen has the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chick.

However, eighty percent of the products were taxed with tariffs in the countries of Central America. It's a deal.
This work here seemed to me that it didn’t make sense, certainly it wasn’t right.
Tell people that they should treat you in the way you treat them.
The governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a bill that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The law demands that violent video games sold in the state of California be labeled with a sticker reading “18” and makes their sale to a minor punishable by a fine of 1000 dollars per offense.
The director of public prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, released a statement this morning in which he announced the charges against Huhne and Pryce.
He has resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by Ed Davey MP. The parliamentarian Norman Lamb should take the position of Minister for Business that Davey is going to vacate.
Huhne and Pryce are required to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on the 16th of February.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to the arm and the cheeks, and Kristoffer Schneider had to undergo reconstructive surgery for his face.
Uka's weapon failed just as he aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider always has a pain, the orbit of one eye, a section of the skull is missing and a mustache reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider has testified via a video link from a USAF base in his homeland.
In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
His first event was the Slalom, where he got a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 out of the 116 contestants obtained the same result in that race.
In the other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers from the women's group in session have not managed to provide their performances and 45 of the 117 giant slalom skiers have not managed to classify themselves in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and cellphone.
The Deputy Inspector General DK Arya declared: “We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop.”
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The superintendent of police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendant appeared in court with a scratched face.
Even though three people were inside when the car hit the house, no one was hurt.
However, the one driving the machine has suffered some severe head injuries.
The street where the accident happened was closed for a period of time so that the rescue services could free the man who was driving the red Audi TT.
At first, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya's son has been to the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh for being accused of attempted murder.
He is in custody while the accusation and the process are specified, but all the eyewitnesses could be contaminated because his image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other places in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists will be treading a dangerous path if they publish photographs or similar items of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is the general responsibility of the prosecution, told journalists that no further comments would be made until at least the indictment.
The document, according to news sources, will discuss the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants based on the borders before the Middle East War of 1967.
According to what has been reported, other discussed topics include the future of Jerusalem, a sacred city for all and two nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to that military presence only for a period of five years.
The trigger of the supplementary test for pest control should be overseen by the rangers, because the test was monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, interim director for conservation and park heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received safety instructions and a complete training.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEO as a first step in a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the anti-regime protests that were happening all over the country starting in October.
The protests, so violent from time to time, have emerged from the lack of elections, a shame expected since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPods have been reported that do not function well, something that has caused six fires in total and left four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) has reported being aware of 27 incidents concerning the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had informed Apple of another 34 overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The minister responded and called the release of the report by Apple as “regrettably deplorable.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 in the morning (09:19 GMT).
The official who deals with emergency management has said that no damages have been reported in the country.
However, the Tsunami Control Center said there were no signs of a possible Tsunami.
A Filipino who had been a policeman hijacked a bus and took tourist hostages from Hong Kong in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Those hostages have been saved even though for now they said that six are dead.
Six guests, including children and adults, were allowed to enter early. Alongside them, some Filipino photographers were also allowed to enter.
The photographers stood in a spot where an old woman had cleared the way to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was later killed.
Liggins was born near his father's workplace and he has started a career as a doctor.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
A man who worked in the hospital, Liggins, began to investigate premature birth during his free time.
His research has shown that the administration of a hormone could accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators recovered the two black boxes.
Even Luna's wrestler colleagues have paid tribute to her.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the full moon. Rather unique, as they say. A courageous woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna will be missed just like me... maybe even more than me... I loved her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the federal elections of 2010, those who opposed the transformation of Australia into a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
The interim prime minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes that Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants believe in that idea and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the rightful monarch of Australia.
In the extreme cases of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist should have competed in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to the fact that he complained about his physical condition, he is now in doubt.
He wasn't able to get the medicines he needed to overcome the pain because they were banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number until now on January 25.
Many people verified the discovery with the use of different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets may have been a way to bring water to the Earth along with organic material that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, in particular, how Earth was made, since comets have crashed onto Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, started his government at the beginning of this year and last month he signed a bill that legalizes marriages between people of the same sex.
He described the statements as "political nonsense and stupidity".
It is hypothesized that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly with shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
It will use satellite technology instead of the old technology that used ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to spot airplanes more precisely and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport has been planned and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley and the parking lots and park-and-ride structures are not available.
To avoid issues due to the lack of transport means, there is a possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science has reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
The researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was believed it would take much longer for this process, due to the reproduction between a native finch of Darwin (Geospiza fortis) and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
It can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small thin shapes.
It can be drawn down to make a thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and flattened into sheets.
It can be made thin by being pressed and stuck onto another metal. It can also be made thin so that it can be used to decorate paintings made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
The hydrogen ions have protons because they have lost electrons (being that hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Crouch down together a handful of dry soil and a little dust, with clean and mixed hands, squish it into a clod.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, making them feel soft and forming a layer that resembles a slush.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bath with running water in every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Those remains of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were baths even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the baths were part of public baths where men and women would stay together in mixed company.
When you call me to see that it is miles away from miles, you have to use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and can reflect it downwards instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a giant rocket costing more than 100 bucks to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an unbelievable way. The most important thing that the wheel has done for us has been making transportation easier and faster.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport have brought me.
Under them there are mammals with more intermediate sizes than most other animals, starting from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic cats that are allowed to live outside) that hunt the largest number of smaller animals like insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special work that someone has that allows them to not compete with others.
There are lions and hyenas among the most sociable felines, as they live in large groups called prides.
The lion prides are made of up to three adult males, related and with a maximum of thirty females and cubs.
The women are linked together because of kinship, as they have a large family of sisters and daughters.
The packs of lions behave in similar ways to those of wolves, animals that resemble them for much both to lions (although they are not big felines) in behavior and sometimes also dangerous for the animals that they hunt.
A male athlete, the tiger is able to climb (even if not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with a strength five times greater than that of a powerful man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (the Panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the ones that are capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but it resembles more snarled and shouted words.
Ocelots prefer to eat smaller animals. They eat monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals hunted by ocelots are smaller than them.
Scientists think that owls hunt and find prey with their sense of smell, and that's where the animals they eat have been previously staying on the train.
They can see well in the dark with their night vision and can also move silently. Owls blend in with their surroundings to hunt the animals they eat and can swoop down from above.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from where they come (if, for example, they move to the mountains or a river, or if they go to a new island in such a way that they cannot return back), they will eventually find an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment, which has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need to develop different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor like in the environment they have left.
The original population has not really changed, it does not need new adjustments.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it starts to resemble more the other population.
In the past, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations appear so different that they can no longer be defined as the same species.
That process which we call speciation, that is said in a simpler way, the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and it is an important part of the evolution process.
The plants produce the oxygen we need to breathe and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans expel.
The plants grow their own food from the sun with photosynthesis and provide shade.
Our hunger on our homes and our clothes from the plants, the biggest part of the food that we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the strongest of all the dinosaurs and was not afraid of others.
His mouth has 70 sharp teeth and other teeth stuck to the roof of his mouth. You cannot escape when it catches you.
It is possible that it had a bifid (split) tongue. It ate turtles, fish, and perhaps also other mosasaurs if it was cannibalistic.
She changed everything she managed to pull into the water, even a big dinosaur like the T-rex couldn't escape.
Although most of their food would be recognizable to us, the Romans had their share of strange and unusual banquet dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snakes, and a type of dormouse called dormice.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women never ate sitting down, while the gentlemen liked to feast together and recline on their sides while they ate their meals.
The meals of ancient Romans could not include food that had arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have any watermelons, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and none of the Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
The people brought sacrifices for the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a sanctuary inside where only the priests could enter.
Once upon a time, special tower structures in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of the life of the Jewish family was spent outside.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were just stalls here along the street. The stone was used to build the houses.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was quite expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. It is said in Norse stories that Erik the Red had been exiled from Iceland for murders, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But even before its discovery, at that time the Eskimos were already living there.
Even if every country was “Scandinavian,” there were still several differences among the people, the kings, the traditions, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that behind the Declaration of Independence there was a treasure map marked.
Everyone, listen carefully, it is not true. Although a lot is written behind that document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The writing is on the back of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that at the beginning of its life, the great parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was kept as a scroll.
Therefore, it is possible that the annotation was added as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by Vichy France. These were the French who had come to terms with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On the 15th of August 1940, the Allies entered the south of France, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon".
In two weeks, the American and French forces would liberate the south of France and were about to move into Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word "civiltà" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil," linked to the Latin "civis," which means "citizen," and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," and it also defines in some way the dimension of society.
City-states were the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization implies the transfer of knowledge between various generations, a cultural imprint that persists, and a proper diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and cannot be recognized as true and proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states were for the first time forming a weak central government — the Congress was the only component — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce its acts.
He did not even have the authority to pass over fiscal laws and state tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, handball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic games.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which make it the seventh largest island in the world!
For the group of islands that Japan has, it is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southeastern Taiwan and began transforming fields from the production of native grain and employed Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas in the west and north of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government had signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which they ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
A large part of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been newly built to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most popular physical image format in the world is the 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the era of those analog films.
It is still part of today's day, but above all its appearance report has been inherited from the sensor formats of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35mm format, it can cause confusion, is 36mm wide and 24mm long.
The appearance ratio of its format (it must be divided by twelve times to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Popularly formed entities (such as the APS type family) are themselves or are very close in terms of this aspect of structure.
The often abused and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It is said that the most effective positioning for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see the example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was brought under control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the countries of Europe, even if there were differences in language and customs.
His power was absolute and it dominated the life of everyone, both sovereigns and common citizens.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to help poor people and that the church's money should be used only for that reason.
The central authority of the Christian church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many to ask if these principles were being respected.
Immediately after hostilities broke out, Great Britain undertook a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective and cut off military supplies and civilian provisions, even though this blockade violated the generally accepted international laws that had been codified in various international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from entering certain parts of the ocean, and it also posed a danger to neutral ships.
Given that there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany was expecting a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the strongest attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid the same situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He had arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) for Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way to represent different periods of time; each Chinese phase or each family could have a distinctive dynasty.
Even among every dynasty there was an unstable moment of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin.
During those periods there were wars among the many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died in battle to conquer the coveted throne of the great palace of Xi’an.
There are several social and political effects like the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Even after the Revolution, the positions were open to all male candidates, and the most ambitious and successful ones could triumph.
It's the same for the military because instead of classifying the army by class, now they are classified by caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the working class, prompting other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The spacious cave, which had withstood the test of time, provided a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
It is situated on the summit of a mountain to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it even if you know it exists. Inside the cave, there is total isolation.
One can see nothing else but the beautiful clear sky above and the several mountains all around. Inside the cave, little is seen and heard of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures that were made to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the most imposing), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and the several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The mark of the "arc upwards" looks like a V and the mark of the "arc downwards" looks like a paperclip or a square without the lower side.
Up means that you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and down means that you have to start from the heel (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The ascending arch usually creates a softer sound, whereas the descending arch creates a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can write your signs in pencil, but remember that the printed arch signs are there for a musical reason, so they must be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
Yesterday they came back to Paris inside a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd of people had forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
A member of the rabble had then whirled in front of the terrified queen the head of a royal guard cut off at Versailles.
The costs of the imperialist war of the United States for the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
Citizens forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of expenses and the interests on obligations were fluctuating in the name of the Filipino government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Naturally, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would have been the substantial gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the environment that led to the creation of the order.
The period when these events happened is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the era of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the Central Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is an expression that encompasses several ideas, from the push of innovation or even the technological imperative, which in a strict sense would mean thinking that the destiny of men is guided by a profound logic linked to scientific principles and their application within technology.
There are two main thoughts about technological determinism: one that technological development is not only driven by culture and politics, and the other that technology is not conditioned by society but manifests itself within it.
For example, you can say that the motor car contributes to the development of roads.
The roads of every town cost and they need to be maintained by a pile of cars, so they have thought about cutting the costs that people have for keeping a car.
The more people have cars, the more they have accidents. Therefore, they have developed new health technologies to help these people who need to be treated.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, taken from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the Romantic environment, geography shaped people, and over time traditions and cultures were born that are linked to that geography, and just as they were in harmony with the place in society, they were more of laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that today Paris is the fashion capital of the world of our times, Constantinople was that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of precious products began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century above all because the Crusaders had returned with goods like silk and spices that were worth more than those that the Byzantine market could offer.
It was at that moment that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was profoundly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time was the result of the crusades and people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of one's family.
Subsistence farming is simple, often organic, and uses original seeds from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other rather simple techniques to maximize the harvest.
In history, the vast majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this still happens in several developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people who think in the same way and who feel neglected by social standards, and they ensure that they develop a sense of identity.
The subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several elements.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging with a distinctive use of symbols of style, which include fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take those few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, bad luck, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These children are called "wild". In these cases, the wild child was confined by people (usually their father and mother); in other cases the abandonment of the child was caused because the father and mother refused the heavy intellectual and physical limitations of the child.
Wild girl children can become important living abuse victims or trauma before being abandoned or having run away.
It is presumed that others have been raised like animals; it is said that someone has lived completely like a wild person.
When he was entirely raised by animals that are not human, the wild child demonstrates behaviors (with physical limits) that are almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that raised him, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
If project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support system goes beyond.
The support system is not a method but rather a tool that provides assistance to those who encounter a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The support system can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of support but also the animated paperclip in Microsoft Office.
The virtual support is within the software and is there to discuss, suggest, and explain those procedures that might be difficult for the student to manage.
Children are placed into care for a great variety of reasons that range from neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not protective, nurturing, and educational, but it happens.
I don't think that the foster care system is a safety zone for these children.
Our donation system ensures safe, reliable, and loving care, stable education, and dependable healthcare assistance.
The entrusted official will provide all the necessary things that were missing in the houses where they were collected.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to other dimensions of use and gratification.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are believed to be important motivations for using the Internet (James and others, 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last just a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is thought that it is possible to understand if a person is lying through the interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his writing, The President's Speech, suggested that people who cannot understand spoken language due to brain damage are still able to accurately measure sincerity.
He finally suggests that these skills in interpreting human behavior could also be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research of the Twentieth century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
In the savannah, for a predator with a digestive system like that of a human, it is difficult to satisfy its need for amino acids from available vegetal resources.
Moreover, the inability to do so has significant consequences: slowing down of growth, malnutrition, and eventually, death.
The more readily available vegetable resources would have been the proteins from leaves and legumes, even if they are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and they also provide high-quality proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during the normal period of sleep and suddenly falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
It can be easily done with a rather quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you happen to turn off the alarm when you sleep, you can position it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm include drinking quite a bit of liquid before sleeping (especially water or tea, a famous diuretic), which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of the present life. Every person has the potential to find peace and contentment within themselves.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders our goal is our tension and being negative.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the techniques of Indian yoga.
In its entirety, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and feeling love towards everything and everyone.
With this Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is activated through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deities. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in the Second World War, and it led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the division of countries.
After two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would have lasted for 40 years and was truly fought by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and several other places.
On the 17th of September 1939, the Polish defense was already in ruins, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans were nearly thwarted overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Russian Army of the Soviet Union entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after the invasion of Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is really the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and things across the oceans.
Traditionally, the job of a navy was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move your people and your goods, and also to interfere with the ability of your enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the most important recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which primarily utilized U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that the Germans would have been able to conquer Great Britain as they had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Usually, domestic goats were kept in herds that went around the hills or other grazing areas, often followed by female goat herders who were paid or hired temporarily, almost like the more well-known shepherds. These methods are still used today.
The animal traction systems had already been developed in England in the 16th century.
Even if animal traction systems were mainly made of wooden shafts, they allowed horses to travel faster and to carry larger loads compared to the somewhat more uneven roads of that time.
The crossing bridges were being invented rather early to keep the wheels in their place. However, it gradually became understood that the wheels would be more efficient if they were on a part of the axle.
This had become common knowledge, but salt caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the wooden wheels had been replaced by steel wheels. In 1767, the first rail tracks entirely made of steel had been introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
My ancestors Australopithecines did not usually walk upright.
The bipedal specializations can be found in fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs even seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more respectfully of the environment, we can join an environmental movement and even be activists to reduce the future suffering to some extent.
In several cases it is just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want a merely temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite clear that the world has significantly changed due to human technological and scientific progress, and the problems have become bigger because of overpopulation and the original lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 shots were fired, now called the "Dunlap Hoarders".
The document was read in public for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on the 8th of July.
Wine was sent to George Washington on the 6th of July, and it had reached his troops in New York on the 9th of July. A copy had arrived in London on the 10th of August.
The 25 soldiers from Dunlap that were known to still exist are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Several people consider me a dinosaur because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many kinds of birds that still look like those from the time of the dinosaurs.

Practically, all the computers operating today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one or two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
The poisoning inside may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, like vomiting, are so general that it's not possible to immediately conduct an analysis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an opened box of medicine or domestic toxic chemical substances.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Scientists speak badly when they talk about these wild beasts.
This name derives from the fleas that lived in people's houses and bit them.
The assassin fleas and a bit of milk, camping in their nest or wherever they find to stay.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and it is therefore the main neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is the disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has discovered that women have a probability twice as high as men to develop MS (Multiple Sclerosis).
A couple could decide that raising a child is not in their interest or in the interest of the child.
These couples could plan an education plan for their children.
With the adoption, the biological father and mother give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method indeed guides the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not superfluous because scientific research is also driven by experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, through questions and observation.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on every scientific question, including psychology, had been accepted.
With the decline of the knowledge of Greek, the West found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Several rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often fundamentally linked to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in the majority of living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are mechanisms that maintain themselves naturally, continuing a cycle of free running even if there are no external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase fooled the beans, or viruses, to implant their DNA inside a bacterium.
They wanted to do two experiments and label the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or label the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the meaning of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be transmitted to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism encourages people interested in visiting natural areas with the intent to enjoy the landscape, with plants and wild animals.
Examples of activities on the site include hiking, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and informing oneself about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns by car to go to the place where they work and cross paths with those going to work at the destination they have just left.
In this dynamic transport network, everyone is in some way connected and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Now science shows that this great carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or about bridges collapsing.
Why do the transport systems often have such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are the transport engineers not competent? Or is something deeper happening at the core?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with one another.
It is unfortunate that the study of traffic flow is difficult because driving behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
It is fortunate that drivers tend to behave within a fairly consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented with mathematics.
To better understand the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and management of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from predators and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives it a wider range of places where smaller prey can hide.
Today, the only insects that cannot turn their heads backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarco had said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
A certain person thought that he was right, but other people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, and also the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems senseless, because you don't really feel that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water that the second largest river carries.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, with a width of six miles in certain parts.
20 percent of the water that rivers on the planet flow into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even if pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size and in technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the language used every day by those who work in the country, whereas Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these can all be found in nature in their original form and are quite easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, thought that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought that they change into new substances to form what we do not see.
The leagues are mainly a mixture of two or more alloys. Do not forget that they have several elements from the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. It's obvious that there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have strong bonds with small quantities of elements that are not metallic, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
There are exactly so many of them that three trillion of them could stand on the point at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was the good friend of many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of newer writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status and use.
Now people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a pencil sharpener.
Even he had to wonder what would become of the keyboard when it is nine years old.
The fission bomb works according to the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up the hill. If the core splits one more time, then it releases some of that energy.
In which some atoms do not have a stable nucleus, which means that they tend to split with little or no external force.
The surface of the Moon is made of crust and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called a crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's more refined under the seas and more widespread under the high plains.
It could be worse on the neighboring side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come up to the surface.
The theories discussed are focused on researching what motivates and pleases people.
These theories suggest that individuals have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized with maturity until adulthood.
These theories examine what makes people want to do the things they want to do and what are the factors in their environment that make them do or not do such things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, there are two behaviors that emerge when managers start to command their former colleagues. On one hand, they try to remain "one of the group" (or buddies).
This type of manager has difficulty making bold decisions, taking disciplinary actions, giving evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, one becomes an unrecognizable person who feels the need to change everything the team has done and to make it their own.
In the end, the leader is fundamentally responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often results in tensions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have the same quality standards as normal teams, but there are small differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as a point of contact for their approved physical group.
Often, they have greater autonomy as team members now because their teams can meet across different time zones that would not be understood by their local administration.
The presence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a characteristic of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Why should an organization undertake the long journey of becoming a learning organization? One objective of putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are well utilized in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Therefore, the process of an organization that works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that satisfies the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning environment.
Angel (2006) explains the approach of the Continuum as an operational method to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it decreases the area of research and makes it seem much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is supported by scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors influence behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The arrival of new technologies allows us to see and study the structures and processes of the brain that had never been seen before.
This provides several pieces of information and materials to make simulation models that help to understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is strongly linked to science fiction, it forms a very important part of computer science, and it concerns the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence concerns the construction of machines to automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
For example, control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to clients' analyses and requests, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These groups have become separate entities, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields because it has been integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. Often a teacher would like to take their students to a place where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers a solution with trips into the virtual field. Students can look at the artifacts of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire superb works of art while they are seated with their class.
Sharing a trip on the virtual field virtually is also a perfect way to think and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a website for their trip to the state capital; every year the website is remodeled anew, but the old versions are kept online as a portfolio.
Blogs can also improve students' writing. Even if students often start their blog experience with neglected grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes their habits.
Given that students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve the writing to avoid being criticized.
Having a blog even "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to feed the audience's interest gives students the motivation to be more intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Maintaining a blog is a tool that encourages collaboration, motivates students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The right use of blogs "can allow students to become more analytical and critical; through an active response to materials on the internet, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings and also describe their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the marvelous capital of Canada where two languages are spoken and which has a series of art galleries and museums that display the past and present of Canada.
Further to the south are the Niagara Falls, and the north hosts the pure natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these clothes and many others would define Ontario as that which is typically considered Canadian in terms of forest.
Large areas further north are not very inhabited and in some of them, there is wilderness that is hardly inhabited.
For a comparison of the population that surprises everyone: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa.
When talking about wild animals, Madagascar is the largest and it is itself a continent.
The large part of the smaller islands are independent nations or linked to France, and known as luxury seaside locations.
The Arabs had also brought Islam to those lands, and it had a great diffusion in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama found the route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended to all women who travel during the day who are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to put on a ring (not one that seems too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences could result in what they consider annoyance, and it is not uncommon to follow along, being caught by the arm, etc.
I have to be hard in refusing men, and I'm not afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it doesn't work!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan had rebuilt the city like Daru l-Badya and the name Casablanca had been given by the Spanish merchants who were established there for commercial purposes.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide variety of trinkets, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; it is located to the east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried all its streets and its center.
Goma is quite safe, but if you go outside, it's better to understand what is happening in the province of North Kivu, which is always at war.
From Goma they leave to climb Nyiragongo, and it is also one of the places where it costs little to see the mountain gorillas.
In Goma you can use the boda-boda (a motorcycle that serves as a taxi) which costs you 500 Congolese francs to get to a nearby place.
Together with its not too accessible nature, “Timbuktu” is used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its name makes it a tourist attraction, and it has its own airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main episodes of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" distributed by PBS.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the cities of the country, because it has a style more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and it runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 km² in size and is divided into 14 ecozones, each one protecting different wild animals.
It is one of the major attractions of South Africa and is considered the pride of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are costs to enter the park and for its daily conservation.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all the South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong, and it is a place that many tourists consider as a center of attention.
The array of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a gleaming graph that is highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the shore towards Kowloon.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps but they also contain some of the last parts that remain of the great jungles that once occupied the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which about a third is occupied by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wild animals, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most of those heading east towards Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses during festival days are often full, it is advised to buy the tickets a few days in advance.
The majority of districts are served by small Japanese minibuses that are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to reach nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) or Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two tracks, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs blockade posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in what is today eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of the Chaco was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, initially called "the great province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay had managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Even smaller migratory movements can be observed here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) and its value is set the same as that of the British pound (GBP).
The currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West shop.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and often in Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are also accepted.
On the peripheral islands, it is possible that credit cards will not be accepted even though British currency and United States dollars might work well; check in advance with the owners what is a good method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so change the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, there are commonly temperatures above +30°C.
Winter can seem cold at first glance: temperatures rarely go below zero, but the wind and humidity mix together and it feels colder than what the forecast says.
There are not particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is more or less the same over the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the beasts are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
Almost all big animals, such as bison, elks, bears, and others, even when they can seem docile, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not stay at the proper distance. These animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also keep in mind that food attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing strongly scented food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a famous naval blockade when seven ships arriving from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain were refused entry to the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is located between the two ports. The most renowned ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
There are beaches made entirely of sand, you can swim without dangers and you can stay in the shade of the pohutukawa trees on most sides of this one.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the eastern part of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are three beaches often full of families with many shops one after the other near the coast. He can swim without getting tired.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is not a complex beer but it is good and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are several old French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines could travel better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of the “flat white” coffee is foreign. A short black is an “espresso”, the cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but very good.
All year round, they make many trips to the coral barrier, and accidents on the barrier caused by these reasons are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, respect the signs, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near the beaches and river estuaries in the north of 1770 from October to April. Occasionally they can be found outside of these times.
The sharks are there, however, it is rare they attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not generally live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although through a travel agency it may also be possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites.
Often travel agencies offer packages that include breakfast, organization of transport to/from the airport, or even combined packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or provide other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of festival participants decide to camp on the site, and most participants consider it a necessary element of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to find a spot to camp near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have ended, there could be sections of the festival where they will continue to make music until late at night.
A certain festival has special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin because crossing the ice makes a terrible noise for the more sensitive people.
The cruises from Saint Petersburg include time in the city. The passengers of the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the regulations).
In general, casinos strive to maximize the time and money spent by the guests. Usually, there are no windows and clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
Usually, they have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them engaged.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered by the house. However, alcohol impairs judgment, and all gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Those who are going to drive in remote areas or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the grip is low and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
In a snow storm, in an instant a lot of snow can fall and cause a blockage.
Visibility can be limited by snow falling or blowing off, or by condensation and frost on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are now normal in several countries, and traffic continues mostly without interruption all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to land trips to see the marvelous African wild animals, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to the vehicles and standard equipment will allow a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called “bush walk”, “safari trekking”, or going for a walk) consists of excursions lasting a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Such an event will be held in another location in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you had booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
The cancellation policies change, but by the end of March most of the cancellation policies due to Covid will not go beyond July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
It is thought that the majority of event tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Hanging wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they are not in the room.
If the iron is not available, or if you don't feel like putting on pressed socks, then you can try with the hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to heat the fabric too much (because it might shrink, or in extreme cases even burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, the water can be boiled in one minute, other places require several minutes.

Travelers could encounter parasites that they are not familiar with in their region of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.

Duty-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods without taxes and excises in specific places.
Direct travelers in countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has driving conditions that are tougher than those on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated and out-of-the-way terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, use your common sense: they are full of steep climbs, narrow stretches, and tight curves.
The speed limits are significantly lower in the sections that come before and after - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strictly adhering to them is more important than in other areas.
However, it's curious how the cellular phone service is stronger here than in many other sections of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rather substantial and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples cooked in the pastry throughout the year, and cherries and plums that appear in summer.
Many German bakery products contain almonds, hazelnuts, and also other fruits with a shell. Popular tortes often go well together with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but substantial pastries, try the one that according to the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.

The straps are the supports for the rider's feet that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide great stability for the rider but can be a concern for safety due to the possibility that the rider's feet could remain stuck inside.
If a rider is thrown from the horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, they could be dragged behind the horse if it runs off. To decrease this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear boots with a heel and a smooth, tight sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrups to fall down if pulled backward by a rider who is falling off.
The Cochamó Valley - the main destination for climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite and rock walls.

Alpine snow sports, like skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - rock paintings showing skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is linked to ski touring in alpine style or to climbing, but usually it does not need to be done, and these two are done on steep terrain with the need for harder skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as if it were a similar trekking route.
In these conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than walking - but only rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is rather small but contains several independent countries. In normal situations, traveling through multiple countries would mean applying for a visa and going through passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as if it were a single country.
As long as you stay within this area, in general you can cross the borders without going through the passport control desk.
In a similar manner, with a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is not a universal definition for which industrial objects are defined as antiques. Each tax agency defines antique objects as those items that are more than 100 years old.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handcrafted products can be considered antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of sustenance among the Sami, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many other professions.
Always according to tradition, however, not all Sami were engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, and the like, and kept reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern sectors. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sami area.

Normally a course will deal with all the issues that have been discussed here in a more detailed manner, usually with practical experience.
A general course lasts 2-5 days and includes simulations, much first aid, and sometimes also training for using weapons.
Books and journals that deal with escaping into the wild nature are common, but there are few publications that talk about war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure to carry valid documents to return.
The government's willingness to issue passports with the unspecified gender (X) or to update documents to match a desired name and gender can vary.
Even the willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is widely variable.
The searches at security checks have also become much more intrusive in the era following September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who need to undergo surgery should not expect to pass through controls without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
The currents of the undertow are the flow that returns inward from those waves that break offshore of the beach, often on rocks or the like.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in the deeper sections, and there a rapid current towards the deep waters could form.
The majority of deaths are caused by exhaustion in the attempt to swim back against the current, which could be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the current, going back upstream is no more difficult than usual.
Before going where you can no longer be caught or, depending on your abilities or if you have been seen, you might want to wait for help.
The shock of returning home comes before you adapt to a new culture (the honeymoon phase is shorter). You feel worse and it takes longer to pass.
Travelers who do not have any problems adapting to a new culture often struggle to return to their own culture.
If you return home after having been away abroad, you’ve gotten used to that new culture and you’ve lost some habits of your own country’s culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people said she was calm and easy to get along with. They know that travelers need to adapt when they arrive in a new country.
It may be that people do not know that travelers returning home need patience and understanding.

The Sphinx makes an impact and tells a long story.
They show a spectacle on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of bases, with 16 active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Beyond are Livingston Island and Deception, where the caldera of a still-active volcano provides a beautiful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region to the south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau, and then they emerge again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northernmost part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4,892 meters of Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without phone signal, a satellite phone could be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a cellular phone because you need to have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.

Finland is a beautiful destination if you like to go boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" actually has over a thousand islands in its lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
In the archipelago and in the lakes there's no need to necessarily use a yacht.
They also include the archipelagos along the coast and the larger lakes, which are big enough for yachts of all sizes, smaller boats or even a kayak, giving them the chance to try a different experience.
Going by boat is the national pastime in Finland and there is one boat for every seven people.
It is present in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise, it is quite a unique thing (for example, in the Netherlands it occurs in one out of every forty people).
The majority of the characteristic cruises on the Baltic have a long stay in Saint Petersburg, in Russia.
The true advantage is that you can visit the historic city for a couple of whole days while at night you return to sleep on the ship.
If you disembark only for shore excursions from the ship, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
These cruises pass Berlin in Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not on the sea and visiting this city is not included in the cruise's prices.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and prejudices towards others that many people have.
For someone, understanding something about the functioning of the airplane and what happens during the flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on what is unknown or on not having control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On a few routes, the larger companies have their airplanes, but for the other routes and for the smaller companies there was a problem.
If they shipped the goods by air, on an air route they might have taken several days to unload and pass through customs.
The only way to speed things up was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending luggage without a passenger, and that is where you come in.
If you want to travel in first class, you have to fork out the money (or it's even better if your company shells out the money for you).
The price is quite expensive for business class and can be up to four times the price of the regular ticket or even eleven times the price if you want to buy first class.
It's completely useless to look for discounts to buy first class or business class tickets if you have to fly from country A to country B without stopping.
Airline companies know well that there are people willing to spend money to travel comfortably and quickly. Therefore, they charge a high price.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
