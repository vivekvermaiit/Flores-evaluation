The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be done by moving forward and making meaningful changes within our organization, rather than revoking accreditation.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored underneath.
This discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed shaft, known as a rachis, but still show other features characteristic of feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development subsequent to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers have suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage rather than chick down.
Scientists specify that it is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

The work carried out was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a sort of halo and is made up of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new mutation was "very disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients are believed to have contracted the virus at the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were part of the hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the planet's large caves, which maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the earth," according to Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS crew (U.S. Geological Survey) and staff at Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the candidate of their choice into an envelope.
After the officials have verified his identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations in a fairly strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no envelope is present at the start of the vote and that no envelope is added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his country.
Apart from Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two individual races at the Championships.
She first participated in the slalom, where she got a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
Her other race, the giant slalom, allowed her to finish in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
In the women's sitting skiing category, four skiers did not manage to finish their course; regarding the giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race failed to rank.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people for the rape of the Swiss national, and we have recovered her phone and laptop."
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, police commissioner, stated that the accused individuals had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car crashed into it, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The lane where the accident occurred was temporarily closed to allow emergency services to extricate the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in police custody awaiting her indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimonies might be compromised as her portrait has been widely circulated.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts have deemed that the publication of photos was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The office of the Crown Prosecutor, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Among the other topics discussed are the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority consents to only a five-year duration.
The shooters from the additional pest control trial were to be closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, interim head of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four designated shooters for the first culling campaign have been duly trained and instructed in safety guidelines.
Martelly inaugurated yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a set of measures aimed at setting the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were supposed to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of defective iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry reacted by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage had been reported in this country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career as a doctor.

While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his free time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the baby's lung maturation.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators retrieved two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey conducted among 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents to transforming Australia into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.

At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as they were prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25th the largest known prime number to date.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply for the Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "gossip and political nonsense."
It is thought that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, rather than ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate planes with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the parking lots and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear of insufficient transport has raised the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the teams' supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the origin of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was previously estimated to be much longer, following the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant conical-billed finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is what is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and producing a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call a person who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket more than 30 meters high is needed to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought us is that it made transportation much simpler and faster.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
Furthermore, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called prides.
The prides consist of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their family consisting of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the full roar of the lion, but rather a sentence whose words would be screams and growls.
Ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by their sense of smell, sniffing their path on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots stalk their prey by blending into their environment before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in an environment different from the one in which it previously was.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered as belonging to the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of the era; it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed its path could not escape.
We are not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is even possible that he was a cannibal.
He would also attack anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was no match for him.
Although the Romans consumed food that we are familiar with, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including boars, peacocks, snails, and dormouse, a type of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they reclined on their side while having their meal.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Some pyramid towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes constructed as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has been sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, found Greenland — and named it such — by traveling further west.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian," there are many differences among the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, you could read the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 and three-quarter inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
It is therefore likely that the rating was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the Vichy French, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," which means large city or city-state and also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen States first formed a weak central government—Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce any of its acts.
He did not have the power to derogate from the tax laws or those on customs duties between the states either.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most titled team in the world and it won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that compose it, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The first information concerning Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing by mentioned it under the name Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most widespread film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still made today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, and this is quite puzzling, 36 mm in width by 24 mm in height.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to this aspect ratio or come very close to it.
The rule of thirds, often mistreated and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that fosters dynamism while providing protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was challenged.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion tied European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are specifically there for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1000 years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this doctrine was being respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain implemented a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined the international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic only elicited a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a tendency towards pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wished to prevent such a situation from occurring again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce battles took place among numerous members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, as the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes from other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters that went beyond the realm of this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became famous by the name of "Hira'" on the "Noor" (light) mountain for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, provides a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Situated at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy at all to find, even if we know it exists. Once we enter the cave, we are completely isolated.
Above, one can contemplate nothing but the clear and magnificent sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "necropolis of Giza," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives as well as his family members.
The "push" symbol looks like a V and the "pull" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
The top means that you must start at the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means that you must start at the frog (which is the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upbow generally produces a softer sound, while a downbow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for a musical reason, so generally they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were obliged, due to the crowd, to have the windows of their carriages opened.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits arising from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place during the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages – a period of history in Europe spanning the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the technological development itself occurs according to a process that largely goes beyond cultural and political influences, and technology impacts societies intrinsically rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The massive ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of healthcare to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until about 1100.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders were returning laden with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of means of communication, Western fashions could lag by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using saved seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "ferocious" or wild. Some wild children were confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability the child had.
Feral children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When they are entirely raised by non-human species, feral children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a way to help learners who are discovering a new teaching such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little paperclip man from Microsoft Office is one too.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to query, guide, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster families for very diverse reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, including extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the reactions of the public towards websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions that last for a few milliseconds.
It is notably claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such capacities for interpreting human behavior can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause variations to alternate between the two pools in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process that involves intentional waking during your sleep period and dozing off shortly after (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock, in order to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids before falling asleep (especially water or tea, known for being diuretic), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of a person's inner peace is opposed to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. It is through the visualization of different deities that energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awakened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the profound conflicts between their different systems, methods, and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and would see real confrontations, through proxy armies, on battlegrounds in Africa as well as in Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transportation of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of the marines has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to move soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close by for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were being constructed in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks for wagons were simply made up of parallel wooden planks, they enabled the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and haul larger loads than on the slightly more bumpy roads of the day.
The crossbeams were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with an iron strip on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails made their appearance.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("upright man").
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
We find bipedal specializations in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even advocate with the aim of alleviating future suffering.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements made by humans, and that the problems have become more significant because of overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and equipped with claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rexes.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for specific first aid instructions related to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitizing humans.
The assassin bugs, like bedbugs, are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's, to take care of a baby's upbringing.
These couples can choose to undertake an adoption plan for their baby.
In the context of an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and particularly on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of the knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often largely depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not merely constitute responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germline cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations may lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts individuals interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities.
For example, one can go see, photograph, and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns by car to go to their workplace and pass other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, each person is somehow connected to a car-based transport system and supports it.
Science now shows that this economy, massively based on carbon, has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km in width.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since antiquity, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are quite simple to mine with the help of primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that these transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, are also found.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when the next innovation arrives.
The fission bomb operates on the following principle: it converts energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A bit like making a heavy cart climb a hill. By splitting the nucleus again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner at the seas and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on understanding what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives certain people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, motivates them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "the good buddy".
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary actions, conduct evaluations, delegate responsibilities, and hold others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things his/her way.

This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose on itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are utilized efficiently in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They thus allow the field of research to be narrowed and made much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumors, and brain injuries affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science which studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The aim of artificial intelligence research is the automation by machines of tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday life's problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been implemented in several home computer software programs and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Quite often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not feasible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at ancient objects from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a magnificent work of art while sitting with their class.
Taking part virtually in a tour is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often approach blogging with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience typically changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to engage the audience motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, blogs can allow students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively responding to online content, they can compare their opinions with those of others and present their own viewpoints on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a great number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
You will find farther south the Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings, which possess pristine natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider the quintessential Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known for being luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands, and this religion spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, at the time when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape route connecting Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman traveling say she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advised to wear a wedding ring (which should not appear too valuable).
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviors they consider harassment. Indeed, it is common for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men's advances, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, one can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from Mount Nyiragongo, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the downtown area.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking treks in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for faraway and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of the show "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the other cities in the rest of the country, as it has a style that is more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km², which is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing specific wildlife.
It is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card which grants access to certain parks in South Africa, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the main focus of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that outlines Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar chart, revealed by its reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront located across from it.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land of the northern shore.
This is the place that the British settlers invested in. Thus, it seems to me a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not composed solely of mangrove swamps: they also harbor some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², about one-third of which is covered by water/swamp areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer there.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once nicknamed "the giant province of the Indies," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
The Spaniards inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller-scale tournaments and matches are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to a British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a currency commonly accepted everywhere in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the neighboring islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currencies may be. Discuss this in advance with the owners to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands money outside of the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo, being located south of the equator, experiences summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the precipitation is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, one must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!

Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notoriously famous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering held in the city, during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous because Auckland straddles two harbors. The most popular ones are found in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very crowded with families, have many shops along the coastline. Swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
You can safely drink the local tap water, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "café crème" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," the cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are conducted throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the authorities' advice, obey all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near the beaches and river estuaries. They can also occasionally be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would shy away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer services, or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other necessary documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be closely involved in the music event, you will need to arrive early to find a well-located camping spot.
Don't forget that even if the musical performances have ended on the main stages, other musical shows may continue late into the night at other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise in the most exposed cabins.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempted from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos generally make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are rarely found there, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They generally offer special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay.
On certain sites, it is the locals who offer alcoholic drinks for free. Nevertheless, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone who drives to high latitudes or crosses mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is practically uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African land, particularly in the savannah, aimed at witnessing the breathtaking spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and the standard equipment allows for good observation of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "walking safari," or "footing") involves hiking, either for a few hours or over several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you might find yourself in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
By ironing damp clothes, you can dry them more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there aren't any in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or if you don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you can find one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute; in others, it needs to be done for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that they are not familiar with in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritations, or, in the most severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers bound for countries where taxes are high can sometimes make considerable savings, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections—generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is oddly much stronger here than in many other parts of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common there: apples are baked and cooked in pastries all year round, while cherries and plums make their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid" depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With Indonesia having 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors favored by the Javanese being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security issue: indeed, the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to come off the saddle if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different large granite walls and cliffs.
From the heights of the peaks, the views of the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world keep discovering new passable paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums," who organize their entire vacations around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: cave paintings showing skiers date back some to 5,000 years BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing, or ski mountaineering.
It resembles alpine-style ski touring, as well as mountaineering, but generally does not incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly greater distances than on foot – but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it includes many independent countries. In typical circumstances, traveling across several countries therefore involves having to apply for multiple visas and undergo multiple passport checks.
The Schengen Area, however, functions a bit like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without going back through passport control points.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to separately apply for a visa for each of the member countries of the area, which saves time, money, and administrative procedures.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax bodies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on the location; in some parts of the world, such as in North America, the age limit may be lower than that in effect in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade holds great significance for many other professions.
Even though, according to tradition, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, while using the reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people work in modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.

If the country you are traveling to is subject to a travel advisory issued by your government, your health insurance abroad or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of various kinds, depending on geographical, topographical, and atmospheric characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Extreme, regional, and seasonal weather phenomena include cold storms, snowstorms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination region, knowing that this can impact the itineraries they are considering.
Anyone considering traveling to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Courses in a hostile environment" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues addressed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A training usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few in number.
Travelers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not indicate a gender (X) or to update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transsexual individuals should not expect to go through scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the currents that return from the waves breaking on the beach, often on a reef or equivalent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current toward deep waters can form there.
In most cases, the deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again. It is also possible, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted or not, that you might want to wait for help.
The shock of reintegration occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes have a lot of trouble readjusting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits from your original culture.
In the beginning, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The sound and light story is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula blend into the plateau, then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which rises to 4,892 meters.
In remote areas without cellular network coverage, you may have no choice but to resort to satellite telephony.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure boats, as well as by expeditions that have needs for remote data transmission and telephony.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This option is particularly popular with young people leaving school, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken a gap year course abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your country.
As a general rule, you have to pay registration fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a top destination for pleasure boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic are characterized by an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by consulting the map above, Berlin is not located near the seashore at all, and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
You shouldn't be ashamed of it: it's no different from the personal fears and worries that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Transport companies are well compensated for making quick deliveries. Very often, in the context of an urgent repair, the issue of deadlines is crucial for the related documents, goods, or spare parts.
On some routes, the large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small companies, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first or business class is to shell out a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not inexpensive: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it is useless to try to obtain discounts for business class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that they can rely on a certain type of traveler who is willing to pay a high price for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their rates accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member country.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent transit hub.
What was the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center, situated around a vast bay, surrounded by mountains.
The broad boulevards, glazed buildings, and modern shopping centers are scattered with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on certain tombstones.
It is worth taking a half-hour walk in this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, located to the north, is easily accessible and was made famous among foreigners by Lord Byron's vivid account of its splendor.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
As you head north, be sure to visit the superb sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a world-renowned site for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that holds almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is still to behave at your best, to act like someone well-mannered. This will greatly facilitate your movements.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians quickly evaporate if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly with beeches, spruces, and firs, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils, and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a very large variety of animal species and birds.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When they visit a monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring your own, and it is brightly colored, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just as men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and makes use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, followed by the word Sie which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to differentiate between certain verbs and objects.
One can also say that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also be sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" distinctly: "caro" means "dear," while "carro" means "cart."
Persian has relatively easy grammar and is mostly regular.
Consequently, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough to it that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their time was not as concerning as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous infrastructures located in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor solely for himself and the other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their most beautiful when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one."
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive.
But, located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to adapt to the (always) heat and strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are planning to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity; it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions related to these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is traditional to spend Easter night awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, theological Christian explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, swimming or on floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance that separates them from the continent, mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the northern lights, as the sky will be dark practically all day.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are classic work attire, and colleagues are addressed by their last name or their position.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their superiors' approval for any decision they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
