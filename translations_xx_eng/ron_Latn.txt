USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and the sports they practice, can be better served by implementing significant changes within our organization rather than by withdrawing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports conducting an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuses of the magnitude so courageously described by those abused by Larry Nassar could have gone unnoticed for so long, and it accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.

This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs were covered with feathers, an already widespread hypothesis, but it also provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on the upper side, with a light or orange color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into how bird feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do display other characteristic elements of feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development that appeared after the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for display. Researchers have suggested that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not chick down.
Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample displays an adult plumage rather than the down of a chick.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 people.

The police stated that they suspect an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant to be responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system proved to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used in combination to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to encourage the observation of the galaxy from Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by the tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy like a kind of aura and is composed of a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he stated that the new variant is 'very disturbing and concerning due to the very high mortality rate'."
It is possible that some patients contracted the virus in the hospital, claims doctor Moll, and at least 2 were hospital medical staff.
During the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at one point in South Africa.

"All entrances to the caves, which have been named 'The Seven Sisters', have a diameter between 100 and 250 meters (328 - 820 feet)."
Infrared images show that temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood of these being caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of some large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that these could represent deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushind from the Astrogeology Team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seclude themselves in a booth and place in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper on which they indicate the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials check the voter’s identity, he/she puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to follow.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send their representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

The deceased are Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and jaw, and Kristoffer Schneider will need reconstructive facial surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned while it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers continuous pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a section of his skull, and has a face reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider's testimony was taken via a video link from a USAF base located in his home country.
After Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
The first event she participated in was the slalom, where she did not reach the finish line on her first attempt. 36 out of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In the other competition she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group, with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the winner, Australian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth place competitor, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's seated event failed to complete their run, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to secure a place in the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.

The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed until the emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was detained pending charge and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted since her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other areas of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and courts have ruled that publishing photographs can be harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects'."
The Crown Prosecution, which is responsible for criminal prosecution, informed journalists that it will not make any further comments at least until the indictment.
According to the information leak, the document will address the dispute regarding the borders, which Palestine wants to be drawn based on the pre-war Middle East boundaries of 1967.
Other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims that, following the signing of the agreement, it should have a continued military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
The hunters who participated in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by the foresters, with the test being monitored and its effectiveness subject to evaluation.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director for Conservation and Park Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety briefing and training.
Martelly took the oath yesterday in front of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEO as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to organize elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPods, which malfunctioned, have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple reported another 34 overheating incidents, which the company said are 'not serious.'"
"The ministry responded, saying that the delay from Apple is 'truly regrettable.'"
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Marianas Office of Emergency Management stated that no damages have been reported in the country.
Additionally, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there are no indications for a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far the death of at least six has been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She pursued obstetrics studies and in 1959 started working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his free time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said that 'Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. A unique moment, just like she was. A strong woman.'"
"Dustin Runnels, nicknamed 'Goldust', commented that 'Luna was as eccentric as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place'."
Out of 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II comes to an end.
34% of those interviewed agree with this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as in three relay events, but his physical condition was questioned due to his complaints.
She could not take the necessary medication to control the pain, as they were banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people checked the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supply to the Earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, aged 53, began his governance earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing "political chatter and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to travel shorter distances, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on satellites, unlike older systems based on ground radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional means of transport available, the surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available in the area.
Concerns about the lack of transportation options have raised the possibility of holding the match behind closed doors, without the team's supporters present.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to the breeding between endemic Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a multitude of designs. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into thin wires that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and pasted over another metal. It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. An indicator can be prepared using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean and wet hands, form a ball out of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which may give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a sort of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sewer systems were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which both men and women used together.
When you call someone thousands of kilometers away, you do this through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket, 100 feet tall, to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel offered us was to provide a much simpler and faster means of transportation.
The train, car, and many other means of transport brought us.
Beneath them, we have several medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept; each feline has its own role to fulfill, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and offspring.
The females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with behavior surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with a force five times greater than that of a strong human.
Tigers fall into the same group (the Panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to consume small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey to eat by using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground to locate them.
Thanks to their nocturnal vision, they can see very well in the dark and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment, then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what was needed before.
The initial population has not changed at all; it needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and represents a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe in, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (meaning they expel it from their lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, having nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set in the palate, meaning that nothing in its path escaped unscathed.
We do not know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaurs, and it is possible that it was even cannibalistic.
Also, it attacks anything that enters the water; not even a huge dinosaur like T-Rex could have faced it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes that included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to have banquets where they would recline on one side while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include dishes that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
The people brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also constructed.
The tip of the tower constituted the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just counters opening directly onto the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was lightly colonized. In the Scandinavian saga, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found Green Land and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of the discoveries he made, tribes of Eskimos were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences regarding the population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might believe that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But it isn't true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words can be read: 'Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document."
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known, however, that in its beginnings, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) had been kept rolled.
Therefore, the notation was likely made simply for labeling.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
"It was led by the French 'from Vichy.' These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked alongside the invaders instead of fighting against them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called 'Operation Dragoon.'"
In just two weeks, the American forces, along with the Free French forces, had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, being related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also somehow defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and reasonable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as actual civilizations.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with Congress being its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on often uncooperative state authorities to implement its decisions.
He also did not have the authority to annul laws and fiscal tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government with such ease that their representatives were often absent.
The national football of Italy, along with the German national football team, is ranked second among the most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
In Japan, there are nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
"Due to the groups of islands that Japan has, it is often said that Japan is, from a geographical point of view, an 'archipelago.'"
The beginning of Taiwan took place a long time ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the practices of aboriginal grain production and employing Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to the present day.
For example, the most common static photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size from the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been adopted by the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
The 35 mm format, somewhat misleadingly, is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much overused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while still maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has connected European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many people question whether the principle was truly being respected.
Shortly after hostilities began, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian provisions, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law provisions outlined in several international agreements signed in the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
With the response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous workplace) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
Also, the periods between consecutive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The most well-known interval of this kind was the Three Kingdoms Period, spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying while fighting to seize the throne of the grand palace in Xi’an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican one, nationalist sentiment, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented ones to achieve success.
The same was true for the military, because instead of a class-based military hierarchy, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things that went beyond the worldly. He used to often go to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira," located on "Noor" (light) Mountain.
The cave itself, which has survived over time, allows us to form a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is hard to find even when you know of its existence. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains all around. Very little of this world can be glimpsed or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, also called the 'Giza Necropolis,' in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the Great Sphinx."
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "upstroke mark" looks like a V, and the "downstroke mark" looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Upwards means you have to start at the tip and push the bow; downwards means you have to start at the frog (that is, the part you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An up-bow stroke usually generates a softer sound, whereas a down-bow stroke is stronger and more decisive.
Don't hesitate to mark your own indications, but remember that the printed directions for bowing techniques are there for musical reasons and normally should be followed.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return from Versailles to Paris.
They moved back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and screaming threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen's eyes.
The war expenses of United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippine state were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Filipino government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period during which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that includes the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or the technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an inherent logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside cultural and political influence and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned."
For example, one might say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the ownership costs of cars.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which results in the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures emerged from that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread by 400 A.D. and persisted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices more prized than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming conducted to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often ecological system that uses stored seeds, native to the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel sidelined by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "untamed" or wild. Some wild children were secluded by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to rejection by the parents because of severe intellectual or physical deficiencies.
It is possible that feral children experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; while others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards people.
Although project-based learning should ease and make learning more interesting, scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding or construction site method is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are included in the software, serving the purpose of questioning, providing hints, and explaining procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for numerous reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even extending to extortion.
There should be no children who grow up in an environment where they are deprived of food, love, and education, but they do exist.
We perceive the family care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, solid education, and reliable healthcare.
Family care is supposed to meet the needs of the children, which were not met in the home where they were previously.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet introduce additional dimensions regarding the approach to types of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can observe if a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech," demonstrated how individuals who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills for interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, while selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
The separation and recombination cause the direction of variation in each generation to be dominated by one or the other of the two genetic pools.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so brings serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if not cooked.
In contrast to these, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides large amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
"Considering all this, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved the 'protein problem' in a manner similar to the chimpanzees in today's savannas."
Sleep interruption is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during the normal sleep period to fall back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you into a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you happen to reset the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking liquids (especially water or tea, which have diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace that a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is one's own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, to which the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques from Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War was beginning.
It was going to last forty years and would be fought seriously by "proxy" armies on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the plans became almost overnight useless when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army were mobilized, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the oceans to the other.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples in this regard was the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time approximately 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them around the home for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, usually under the care of goatherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonway-type roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed horses to achieve higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly more uneven roads of that time.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, it was concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
This became a widespread practice, but the iron led to the faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transport was walking; people started walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not usually walk in an upright position.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus was already walking bipedally seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce future suffering.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should disable them.
It is evident that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are greater now due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 prints were made, known as 'Dunlap broadsides.'"
On July 8th, the first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 still existing Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds, many characteristics similar to dinosaurs can still be seen.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically, all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately evident. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best clue for internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for first aid instructions regarding that specific poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the old resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are almost 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is neither in their interest nor in the child's interest.
These couples can choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
He is not the only one though, experimentation and an experiment represent a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers predominantly used classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas on all aspects related to science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not merely responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by labeling either the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in any other part can cause cell death or cancer.
Organized tourism centered around nature exploration attracts individuals interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing, and learning more about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave by car from the small rural settlements to head to their workplaces, passing by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a private car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this heavily carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of dissatisfaction regarding water quality or bridge collapses are rarely encountered.
Why do transport systems give rise to such dissatisfaction, why do they fail day after day? Could it be that transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent the traffic flow, we need to establish relationships among the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to begin flying. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and to find food and mates for reproduction much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This offers them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some considered that he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles in some places.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical mastery of construction.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by the majority of those who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with certain fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because these can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air, and fire.
It rather reminded of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he had also theorized that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You'll see that some alloys may also include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything found in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a friend to many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing tools emerged, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to lay a hand on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something newer appears.
A fission bomb operates based on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no momentum.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in areas of higher relief.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying the elements that attract people's attention or give them pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop towards maturity.
These theories study what drives some people to want to do what they do and what elements of their surrounding environment may cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories regarding content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behavior can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who believe they need to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's success or failure.
Often, this behavior leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for the physical group to which they belong.
Often, they have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also represents a unique component of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of implementing the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely.
Consequently, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process to meet the needs of the customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Data from neurobiology represent physical evidence underpinning a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. As such, it allows the narrowing of research scope and its definition with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to clients' diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, but it has also been used in several software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would enjoy taking their students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while in the classroom.
Virtual sharing of a field trip is also an excellent way to reflect on the journey and to share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the site is revamped, and the previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student's writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Given that students often represent the most critical audience, the blog author begins to make efforts to improve their writing and to avoid criticism.
"Furthermore, blogging 'forces students to be more aware of the surrounding world.' The need to respond to their audience's interests inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their study far beyond the usual school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs 'can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, offering a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while the north hosts the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka district and much more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are nearly uninhabited wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that has the gift of surprising many: the number of African Americans living in the USA is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coasts of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true standalone continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling should say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is good to wear a wedding ring, but it should not look expensive.
Women need to keep in mind that cultural differences can lead to what may be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be determined when you refuse a man and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still doesn't mean it's OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by the Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a multitude of all kinds of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from Mount Nyiragongo, which buried most of the settlement's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, visits outside the city require an effort to gather information in order to understand the current state of the ongoing fights in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, also offering some of the cheapest trips to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
For traveling through Goma, one can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Along with its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, distant places."
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates's PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast with the rest of the country's cities because it has a flair more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered by the boundary with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the national parks in this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It might also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a series of parks in South Africa or to all the national parks of South Africa.
The name of the territory Hong Kong is given by Hong Kong Island and it is the place that many tourists regard as the central point.
The exhibition of buildings that contributes to the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a sparkling bar chart that is highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed onto reclaimed land along the northern shores.
This is the space that the British colonizers appropriated, and therefore, for anyone seeking evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last bastions of the vast jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water/swamps.
Starting from 1966, Sundarbans became a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that, currently, there are 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east to Jakar / Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because the buses that connect the districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní represented the most important group of indigenous people living in what is now Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"Paraguay, previously called 'The Giant Province of the Indies', was established in the 16th century, after Spanish conquistadors encountered the indigenous groups."
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has maintained, with effort, much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is set as equivalent to 1 British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they will likely accept British and American currency; contact the owners in advance to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you must exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures often reach above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below the freezing point, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than what the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particularly 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the entire year."
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, the bison, moose, bear, and almost all other large animals can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the correct distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's good to give them their space.
Additionally, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strongly scented foods and to keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the state of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of the state of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most famous of these are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (located in the North Harbour district), situated on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where it is safe to swim, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the suburban market areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide array of shops lining the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be found, but the New Zealand or Australian ones would go better.
The local tap water is drinkable, but if you have concerns, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is "espresso," cappuccino comes filled to the brim with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to Belgian quality standards. The fruit juices are pricey, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the entire year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay extra attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be encountered outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides the traveler with peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent, you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests must be addressed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that, although the music from the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea during winter, take note of the cabin's location, given that navigating through ice produces an unbearable noise for the more sensitive ones.
The cruises from Saint Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the obligation to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent by clients and the money they spend here. Usually, there are no windows and clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
Usually, they have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the good mood and ensure the guests stay at the venue.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication affects judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay clear-headed.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On the icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive like on dry asphalt.
During the blizzard, in a very short period, enough snow can fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, fog, or ice formation on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic operates mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the main tourist attraction of Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as commonly used, refers to overland journeys undertaken to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and the standard equipment will allow for a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called 'bush walk', 'safari hike', or 'on foot') consists of hikes, either for a few hours or a few days."
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics.
If you booked plane tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be facing a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, cancellation policies due to coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with regular tickets costing around 7000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not available in the room.
If you do not have an iron available or do not like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer if you have one on hand.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others, several minutes are required.
The filters differ from each other in terms of efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider the option of buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritations or, in severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person using physical force are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping offers you in certain locations the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers who are about to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult traffic conditions on the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated and undeveloped areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, don't lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves predominate.
Speed limits are significantly lower than those in previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is therefore all the more important to strictly observe them.
However, quite bizarrely, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other parts of the trail, e.g., Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Often, popular cakes go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small yet rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be 'dry' or 'liquid' depending on the amount of liquid."
In the interior regions of northern India and in Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without other qualifiers, however, the term tends to refer to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a series of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors preferred by the Javanese being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They offer the rider better stability, but they can pose safety issues, as the rider's feet might get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from the saddle but remains with one foot caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag him along when it takes off running. To minimize this risk, a series of precautionary measures can be taken.
First of all, most people who ride wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if they are pulled backward by a rider falling off the saddle.
Valle Cochamó - the most sought-after place for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of high granite walls and peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits. Climbers from all over the world continuously chart new routes among the walls with unlimited potential.
Sports that involve descending on snow, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down on snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
"Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called 'ski bums' in English, who organize entire vacations around skiing in a certain location."
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings depicting skiers from before 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is a related activity, but it usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering tours, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will manage to cover distances somewhat longer than walking – but very rarely will you be able to reach typical cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack, on well-groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean going through visa acquisition procedures and passport control repeatedly.
In this sense, the Schengen Area is organized somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having to do so at passport control points.
Similarly, whoever has a Schengen visa does not need to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member countries individually, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that establishes what produced items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies regard items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies depending on the geographical location, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
The rearing of reindeer is an important source of income among the Sami, and the culture related to trade is also important for many who have other occupations.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they have lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer more as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word 'țigan' is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population."
If the country you are about to visit is under a travel warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also wish to consult advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
One example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general, and overly simplified manner, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Extreme weather conditions" is a generic term used for any type of hazardous meteorological phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and come in various forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe climate phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the severe weather risks affecting the area, as they could disrupt their travel plans.
It is advisable for anyone planning to travel to a country that might be considered a war zone to receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment training" will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will typically last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
The books and magazines that deal with survival in the wilderness are quite numerous, but the publications that address war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they possess valid documents for their return journey.
The openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports without a declared gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rip currents are the returning flow towards the ocean from the waves that break on the beach, often at a reef or a similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current towards the deep waters can form there.
The majority of deaths occur due to exhaustion in the attempt to swim back against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move to a position where you are not caught again, and depending on the skills you have and whether someone has seen you or not, you might want to wait to be rescued.
The shock of returning home manifests more quickly than culture shock (it lasts less than the honeymoon euphoria), has a longer duration, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes face particular difficulties in readapting to their native culture.
If you had returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits from your native culture.
When you had just gone abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, being aware that visiting a new country involves an adaptation process.
People do not always expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the entire area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, the noise made by tourists and vendors is constantly heard. The sound and light show seems to come straight out of a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km to the north of the peninsula. The largest one is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the southern part of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula Mountains converge to give rise to this plateau, then separate again to form the 360 km range of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m.
In isolated areas without cell signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a cell phone because you need to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used in maritime transport, including by leisure boats, as well as by expeditions that require remote transmission of data and voice.
The local telephone service provider might be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people planning a gap year is to combine traveling with studying.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before attending a university, without jeopardizing their educational journey.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year of courses abroad can even increase your chances of gaining access to higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
"Finland is a wonderful place for rowing. 'The land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos on the coast."
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coasts and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national recreational activity of Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from one to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you travel on land only during tours from a ship, you will not need a separate visa (starting from 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things, which manifest in many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft operates and what happens during flight may be helpful in overcoming the fear that is based on the unknown or the lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential regarding documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to make it pass faster was to be sent as checked baggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large stack of money for this privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times more for first class!
In general, it is not even worth looking for discounts on business class or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, in which context they charge fares according to the demands.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered as a result of an interethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern region of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Eastern Orthodoxy.
İzmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed, and modern commercial center, situated around an enormous gulf and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with the glass-facade buildings and modern shopping centers, are equipped with traditional red tile roofs from the 18th century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city possesses an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour strolling through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became renowned outside the country's borders following an enthusiastic overview of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the northern part, you can visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that, in principle, you are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that holds nearly incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are requested to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and scratching on the existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Nearly half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are made only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
Spanish is, however, widely used in public transportation, alongside other services.
Periodic announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
"Although it is often just a stereotype not in line with reality, to have an enjoyable stay in Paris, it is good to behave as well as possible, like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-mannered). It will help you manage with much greater ease."
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you demonstrate a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types, and altitude levels.
The region also hosts an exceptionally wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries provide coverings for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size for men!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used abundantly.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even within a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
Also, without a doubt, it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility that a verb or an adjective might be used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most of them being pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters you need to pay more attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, whereas carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Obviously, someone who knows a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a bit of Spanish may prematurely conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated these days and remain open as museums or educational places.
Since during their heyday light pollution was not as big an issue as it is nowadays, they are usually located in cities or campuses, being more accessible than those built in our times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas that have favorable weather conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first parties dedicated to the cherry blossom were hosted by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best nowhere other than in their natural environment, so do not fall prey to the temptation of picking even "just one" of them.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place, where you can easily find your way around and buy almost anything as soon as you arrive there.
"But being in the 'upper tropics', just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to face both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when it's clear, less often)."
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the place where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are buried alongside their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for organizing a vacation.
For example, visiting castles on the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions related to this holiday have been adopted both by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often organize an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally reached the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, resulting in the giant tortoise being the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the areas in the Arctic or Antarctica during the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon line.
This offers a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is, therefore, often not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
The Japanese work culture has a more strongly hierarchical and formal character than the one Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits represent the standard attire in the business environment, and colleagues address each other using the surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is an essential element, with an emphasis on group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain their superiors' approval for all the decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
