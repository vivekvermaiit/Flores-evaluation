Gold can be crafted into many shapes. It can be molded until it becomes small.
That when dry becomes thin wire, it becomes twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled until it turns into paper.
Gold is used as a material because of its great value and is attached to various other metals. It is often used as a decorative element for hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
That is known as a chemical substance. It can be used in a reactor using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of its chemical components.
The pH level indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions (H in pH) from the chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).

In the yard, there are many medium-sized cats facing medium-sized animals like rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
In the end, there are many small cats (including pet cats), that prey on various small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The cat's hiding place should just be a clear concept, a special design so that each cat will not be able to mate.
The lion is a type of cat that is very social, living in large groups that are called prides.
Pride is present due to one up to three adult male lions accompanied by approximately thirty lionesses and their young.
Female relatives usually form close bonds, becoming an extended family with female relatives and their children.
The pride of a lion operates differently from a pack of wolves or dogs, hunting stealthily like a lion (but not just any big cat) in its behavior, and also it is very lethal in hunting its prey.
As a skilled athlete, some with well-known abilities, like a tiger can jump (even though not very well), block, move quickly in close range and hear five times a normal human's capability.
Tigers are part of the group (Genus Panthera) like lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four types of cats are the only ones that can roar.
The sound of the tiger is not just like the loud roar of a lion, but more like the resonance of words spoken harshly.
The ocelot likes to eat small prey. It will catch monkeys, snakes, turtles, and birds if it can. All the prey that is caught by the ocelot is usually smaller than itself.
Scientists have discovered that ocelots stalk and catch their prey by silently tracking them through scent trails left on the ground.
They are skilled at seeing very well in the dark by using night vision, and also walk stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by wandering through the area and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population of its origin (such as when it moves to a mountain or river, or when it moves to a new island preventing it from returning) it will adapt to exist in an environment that is different from its previous location.
This new environment has abundant resources and fierce competition, leading the new population to develop distinct characteristics or adaptations to become effective competitors compared to what existed before.
The original population has not changed much, they still have the same adaptability as before.
Once they moved, a new population began adapting to a new environment, they started to become noticeably different from other populations.
Eventually, after hundreds or even millions of years, the two populations will become very different so they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of a new species. Speciation is a consequence that is not accidental and is an integral part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which is inhaled by humans, and they absorb carbon dioxide which is exhaled by humans (exhale).
Each leaf makes its own food from sunlight using photosynthesis. It also prepares a place to exchange gases.
We make our homes with plants and create clothing from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The Mosasaurus was an apex predator in its time, so it was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Its mouth contains more than 70 sharp, blade-like teeth with additional teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that enters its path can escape.
We do not know for sure, but possibly it branched off. Its food could be turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that it was a cannibal.
He also praised how anything that entered the water; felt that a huge dinosaur like a T. rex could not compare.

The Babylonians built a great temple for their gods which was called the house of the god.
People will bring offerings to the gods, then the priest will strive to fulfill the deity's wishes using rituals and festivals.
Every temple has an outer courtyard that is large and then a holy place in the middle where only priests can enter.
In this place, a special tower in the form of a pyramid, known as a ziggurat, is constructed as part of the temple.
At the top of the tower is the sacred place of the deity.

If you ever watched the movie National Treasure, you would find a clue from a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is simply not appropriate. Although there is something written in the corner of the document, it is not just a treasure map.
Written on the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The writing can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Actually, there is nothing certain that is known regarding who wrote it, but it is known that in the beginning of this century, most of the large parchment documents (measuring 29Â¾ inches by 24Â½ inches) were rolled up when stored.
So, maybe the circle is just given an addition such as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ongoing battles have already secured the northern regions of France, but not yet in the south.
That was commanded by "Vichy" France. These were the French people who had already made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers without exception.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked Southern France, this attack was called "Operation Dragon".
At two weeks' time, the American forces and Free France will liberate Southern France and advance towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture that is implemented by a large group of people who live and work together, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also signifies the greatness of that community.
City-states are the beginnings of nations. Civilized culture is reflected by the presence of knowledge passed down through many generations, the cultural traces that still exist, and the equitable dissemination.
Cultural erosion is happening without leaving historical evidence that should be used and is making proper civilization disappear.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states originally formed a central government as established by the Congress as its component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has the power to impose taxes, and, since there is no national executive or judicial branch, it is based on the authority of the state, which often does not intend to be cooperative, in enforcing its laws.
It also does not have the authority to impose laws and tax rates in the country.
This article states the complete agreement from all previous countries that amendments are accepted, and that countries underestimate the central government if their representatives do not attend.

Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (with the largest called Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/archipelago of Japan, Japan is known, geographically, as an "archipelago".
The island of Taiwan was known since the 15th century by European sailors crossing the seas who recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production practices of the native grains and employing Chinese labor to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1912) forced control over the western and northern regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
In the year 1895, after it lost in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until the year 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many buildings along the complex's coast have been rebuilt to provide visitors with a better idea of what the area has to offer.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and its restoration continues until now.
For example, the most commonly used photographic image format in the world is 35 millimeters, which had a dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
This is still being produced now, but what is more important is the aspect ratio that has been inherited by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35mm format actually, causing a bit of confusion, is 36mm wide with a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (specified as twelve to get the closest integer ratio) is thus stated as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family) are similar to or approximate this aspect ratio.
The third rule of thirds, which is often misused and simply mocked, is a simple guideline that brings dynamism and maintains proper balance through its imagery.
This explains that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection points formed by dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, gained attention.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European countries together despite differences in language and customs.
The power that governs all people, from kings to ordinary citizens.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and monetary donations to the church are a form of fulfilling that pathway.
The central authority of the church has existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many people to question whether this principle has been outdated.
Immediately after hostilities began, Britain conducted a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy has proven its effectiveness, targeting vital military and civil supplies, though the blockade violates universally accepted international laws that have been codified through several trials over the past two centuries.
England dammed the international river to prevent the floodwaters from entering all the seas there, resulting in a blockade enforced with neutral ships.
Because there was a response limited by this tactic, Germany hoped for a similar response from their unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the tendency that occurred among many inhabitants of the nation and the country was characterized by pacifism and isolation.

In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison company in New York City.
He came to the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods; each part of China and a powerful family constituted a distinct dynasty.
Each dynasty's collapse was due to instability from the provinces that divided. The most fatal from these periods were the three Epochs that occurred over 60 years with the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During this period, fierce battles took place among many nobility who fought to obtain the throne.
These three kingdoms were among the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Many people died due to the struggle for the highest position at the Grand Palace in Xi'an.

Muhammad was very pleased with the various aspects of worldly life. He often visited the cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
He represents himself, who was safe at that time, providing the clearest image of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Marriage on one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is very isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it cannot be found if it is aware of its existence. When arriving at the cave, it is total isolation.
There is nothing visible beyond the clear and good sky above, surrounded by many mountains. Only a little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the great pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures made for burying deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Nile Valley of Egypt, contains several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built for the burial of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to bury the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "upward-facing" symbol is like a 'V' and the "downward-facing" symbol is like a box that has its own side pointing downwards.
Facing up means you should aim from the front and back of the bow, and facing down means you should aim from the middle (where your fingers hold the bow) and bend the bow.
The bow that is gently drawn usually produces a soft sound, but the bow that is pulled tightly produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Do not hesitate to take a pencil to mark the patterns, but remember that the printed marks there are for good reason, so they usually should be followed.

In order to understand 'templar' it is necessary to understand the context that causes the occurrence of discharge.
The term is commonly referred to as the high Middle Ages in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The middle ages are further divided into the earlier middle ages and the later middle ages, which ended conventionally around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses various understandings in practice, ranging from the impetus of technology or the creation of technology to the understanding that is purely a guide for individuals driven by subconscious choices related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Too many interpretations of technological determinism have two common perceptions: that the development of technology tends to follow its own path which often exists independently of cultural or political intervention, and that technology will have an "effect" on the related society, compared to a society conditioned according to social circumstances.
For example, it can be said that automobiles and motorcycles are due to the development of highways.
However, the national road network was not suitable as the economy grew rapidly with more cars, causing new production methods to evolve to reduce the cost of car manufacturing.
The increase in mass vehicle production is also the cause of the rising number of traffic accidents, which has led to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to treat broken bodies.
Romanticism has a major element that determines culture, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, Schlegel.
In the context of romance, individuals who are influenced by geography, and embrace customs and culture related to that geography arise, and this is similar to places of society, better in terms of the bonds created and moved.
Because Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Developed as a center of civilization from around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status as the wealthiest of the twelfth century was because officials of the Crusaders had departed carrying gifts like silk and spices, which were valued more than what was known in the Byzantine market.
During that era, the transition of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
Gothic style peaked during the period of the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Previously, the achievements were influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, although communication channels were limited, the style in the West has remained consistent for 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe witnessed the development of its cultural styles. One of the significant developments was a result of the Crusades, incorporating buttons as fasteners in clothing or fabric.
Subsistence farming is a type of agriculture carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a traditional system, which is organically based, using seeds that are native to the 'ecoregion' combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques in order to achieve maximum yield.
Historically, many farmers engaged in subsistence farming and this is still practiced in developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who share similar beliefs that go unnoticed by social standards and encourage them to develop a sense of identity.
A subculture can change based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The quality that determines subculture stems from linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of the pepes subculture signify their membership using distinctive and symbolic styles, which include fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to consider various cases of less fortunate children, children who are neglected, suffering, or experiencing deliberate abuse, which is not socialized by the youth and elders during their daily lives.
Children like these are called "feral" or wild. Many wild children have been confined by people (usually their parents); in many cases, these children have not been heard of because of their parents' refusal of the intellectual or physical disabilities that the child may have.
Children who are feral often experience abuse or severe trauma before separating or losing themselves.
Other than this, it was already enlarged by the suspect; there are those who complain living in the wild environment.
If they can run away from humans, these feral children behave like animals that are afraid or indifferent to people.
However, basic learning through projects should make learning fun and enjoyable, which can make children learn a lot.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a form of assistance that provides support to individuals who are experiencing new learning developments, such as using new computer programs or tackling new projects.
Scaffold is both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold like a small paperclip found in Microsoft Office.
This virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and aims to provide, ask, and inform procedures that should challenge students to utilize their potential.
The children are placed in the orphanage due to various reasons such as neglect, abuse, and other issues like exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are not heard, cared for, and educated, but they do.
I fully understand the nurturing system to ensure it becomes a safe place for these children.
My entire child care system should have a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and accessible healthcare.
Orphanages should provide all the necessities that cannot be met at home before the children are taken in.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The notable symbol of the internet introduces an additional dimension to the approach of usability and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are perceived as primary motivations for participating in the use of the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Solitude" and "maintaining relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they analyzed the behavior of web users.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of subtle expressions, facial movements conducted in just a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that he/she can find out if someone is lying by interpreting genuine micro/small expressions.
In his essay titled The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks describes how people who are unable to comprehend the speech due to brain damage are still able to appreciate its sincerity accurately.
He suggests that such abilities in understanding human behaviors can be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and revealed.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection eliminates from the pool of expressed variations.
A variety of shuffling and recombination that alternates between two pools in each generation.
Go to the Savanna, made difficult by primates that have digestive systems like humans, to meet the need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Apart from that, accidents from carrying out these actions can result in serious consequences: Stunted Growth, Malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Factory resources that are most easily accessed are proteins obtained from leaves and legumes, but this is very difficult for primates like us to digest beyond what is ingested.
On the contrary, the chase feast (ants, termites, eggs) is not easily digested, but it provides a high quantity of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All that said, we cannot ignore if our ancestors faced "protein problems" in the same way as the chimpanzees inhabiting the savanna until now.
Sleep disturbances are the process of awakening that occurs intentionally during a normal sleep period and the most severe sleep in adults (10-60 minutes).
This can be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock so as to allow you to wake up without being startled.
If you find yourself needing to reset your sleep schedule, this can be achieved by placing an alarm clock on the other side of your room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Choosing different biorhythm involves consuming a lot of fluids (mainly water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, forcing the body to release.
The presence of inner peace obtained by someone has an inverse correlation with the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the living power that exists. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone wants to reach enlightenment. One thing that blocks this goal is the tension and negativity within our bodies.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is influenced by Mahayana compassion and uses many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In the essence of Tibetan Buddhism generally. This is Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and unwavering love that are practiced.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini Energy (Energy of enlightenment) is formed using yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The place for Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. By using visualizations with deities, the blocked energy channels are opened, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, which led to a collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. The aftermath of the war, the collapse of systems, processes, and cultures caused countries to fall apart.
Two years after the end of that war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
This will take place in the next forty years and will be a real struggle, by four forces, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already collapsed, and its only hope was to regroup in the southern part near the Romanian border.
However, this plan was considered obsolete and secretive when more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union, the Red Army, entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking the eastern territories of Poland, violating the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression agreement, the Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods remains the most efficient way to move large quantities of cargo and people across the sea.
Naval operations traditionally serve to protect a country's sovereignty, ensuring the safety of its citizens and goods, while also providing defense against enemies by managing people and goods.
One example of new technology that can be quoted with this indicator is the Atlantic Campaign during WWII. America tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to support England.
At the exact time, the German navy, especially using U-shaped boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies did nothing, Germany might have managed to control England because they had power within Europe.
Goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to take care of their domesticated animals for their milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Many domestic goats are herded in their flocks that roam in the hills or other open areas, usually guarded by shepherds who are still children or teenagers, similar to many well-known shepherds. This herding method is still practiced today.
Wagons were built in England at the beginning of the 16th century.
Although the train tracks were only made of wooden boards arranged in sequence, it allowed the horse to run at high speed and carry large items on the slightly rough path in that area.
Railroad ties are traditionally made of wood to keep the tracks in place. However, over time, it was discovered that they could be made more efficient if covered with steel on top.
This can be done many times, but the iron that encircles the wooden wheel of the carriage wears out quickly.
Ultimately, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, all the rails originating were made of iron introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, humans began walking approximately two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
The humans that are found, Australopithecus, did not always walk upright throughout the day.
The specialization of bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus probably walked on two legs from about seven million years ago.
We must begin living wisely on our planet, we must join environmental movements, and we must become activists committed to reducing the difficulties in the upcoming times until a solution is implemented.
This is often like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want to create temporary measures, then we should find the root cause of the issue, and we should solve that issue.
It is clear that the world has experienced significant changes due to the scientific and technological advancements of humans, and the challenges have become larger due to the overly large population as well as the human lifestyle that is centered on pleasure.
After being accepted by Congress on July 4, the draft, which was handwritten by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to various other blocks to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, approximately 150 to 200 copies were created, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first general reading of this document was by John Nixon outside the Independence Building on July 8th.
A letter was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which was read before his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
25 Dunlap leaflets that are known to exist are merely copies of the earliest documents that were saved. The original handwritten copies are not safe.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of it like a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
However, there are many words about birds that are still overlooked like dinosaurs.
He has scaly feet and nails, he is oviparous, and he walks using two strong legs like a T-Rex.
All the computers used today basically operate by manipulating information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number consists of only two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, when using computer terminology.
Poisoning from fish is not easily recognized. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite common so a definite diagnosis is difficult to establish.
The best indicator of poisoning is often the presence of containers that are open with medications or household chemicals.
Protect the label with the help of the first command which faces this poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is taken from the close connection in the past with lice, which are insects that have highly adapted to becoming parasites on humans.
Predator bugs and their nymphs are both nidicolous, adapting to live in a host's nest or house.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common nerve disease faced by young adults and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found women have a higher chance of having MS than men.
Couples deciding to divorce should not just consider their own best interests, but also the interests of their children, by prioritizing the children.
These couples have the option to choose to have plans for adopting their children.
Regarding adoption, the birth parents relinquish their rights as guardians if another couple is allowed to take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using scientific methods. This method essentially guides research that is most scientific.
However, it is not just limited to walking on its own, experimentation, and trials are used to test one or more hypotheses that might exist, raising questions, and making suggestions also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and, primarily, on the Latin Bible.
What is accepted is Aristotle's view on everything regarding knowledge, including psychology.
Because Greek knowledge flourished, the West was influenced by many Greek philosophical and scientific achievements.
Many neglected rhythms in physiology and numerous behaviors rely heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production using the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which do not have responses to external periodic cues, have been documented in many living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is an independent oscillator that will continue a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the studies that showed DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, by injecting their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments marking the DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein containing radioactive sulfur.
Mutation is a change that varies according to the type of mutation, caused by a section of genetic material that changes, and if the affected cell is a reproductive cell, it is a germinal cell.
Only mutations in germinal cells that are obtained are passed on to small children, while mutations in other locations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Tourism is based on locations that attract people who enjoy visiting natural areas to appreciate the scenery, including unique wildlife and hunting.
Examples of activities in their places such as talking, fishing, photography, flying kites, and visiting parks while learning information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Kalimantan.
This morning, people left their small rural towns by car to go to their workplaces, passing by others whose destination was the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is interconnected and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
The current knowledge reveals that this large carbon economy has removed one of the stable pillars from the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone in the community uses the transportation system. Many people are complaining about the transportation system.
In developed countries, people often hear complaints about the quality of water or the poor condition of bridges.
How does making the transportation system cause complaints like this, how can it get worse day by day? Is it that the transportation engineer is not capable? Or is there an indication of fundamental issues?
Traffic flow is merely a lesson about the movement of each driver and vehicle between two points and the interactions that occur in front of each other.
Unfortunately, learning about traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers operating in moderately consistent regions; Because of this, traffic flow has a logical consistency and it can be approximately represented mathematically.
The relationship in representing traffic flow has been identified in three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship aids in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the first creatures to be brought to the sky. Their ability to fly helps them evade predators and to obtain food and mates more efficiently.
Too many insects are agile with the ability to fold their wings again towards the side of their bodies.
This provides them with an expanded range due to the narrow places used to hide from predators.
Nowadays, one type of insect that cannot fold its wings is the dragonfly and the damselfly.
Nine years later, a boy named Aristarchus proposed the Solar System centered around the Sun.
Many people believed it to be correct, but many others believed the opposite; it was the Solar System that revolved around the Earth, and also the Sun (and other stars).
This seems to make sense, because the world doesn't operate that way, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles.
20 percent of the water flowing from the rivers on this planet into the sea comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although pyramid construction using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and technical building expertise.
The New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt is reflected in its monuments, which are over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also a daily language used by many people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are of the Roman Catholic faith.
People have long known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these can be found in their natural form in the earth and can be relatively easily mined using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, mentioned a theory where everything is composed of a combination of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
These are more like four forms of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also states that this matter can change into a new substance by forming something visible.
An alloy is fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget the presence of many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are also metals like silver and gold.
He also has an alloy containing a number of non-metal elements such as carbon.
Everything that exists in the world is composed of substances. All substances are composed of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are very small, making up trillions of them can be arranged at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, a pencil is a good tool for many people when they write.
Unfortunately, due to the development of new transcription methods, the status of pencils has declined to a lower level.
The person is now writing a message on the computer screen, not wanting it to be seen by someone around.
An elder once asked what will happen with the keyboard if something new is discovered.
A fission bomb works on the principle of releasing energy by splitting a nucleus containing many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Unleashing the nucleus and then releasing various things with that energy.
Many atoms have nuclei that are unstable, which means they are prone to decay with little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon is covered with rocks and dust. The layer on the side of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the close side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner at the bottom like a cliff and thicker at the top of a high plateau.
Perhaps there are many bubbles on the side which appear because the crust is thin. This is due to magma rising to the surface.
Content theory focuses on understanding what makes people motivated or interested in them.
These theories suggest that individuals have needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow and develop.
These theories explain how individuals perceive what is happening, what actions are being performed, and what exists in their environment which influences whether they will act or not act on those perceptions.
Two prominent content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, both performers gained acclaim when the manager started leading those who were previously their counterpart. At first glance, the spectrum seems to still be striving to be "part of that male group" (or female).
This type of manager is capable of making few decisions, enforcing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and asking people to be accountable.
At the forefront of a different spectrum, one transforms into a person who is unrecognized and feels the need to change the position that the team has already established and to understand it as their own.
How are you, a leader ultimately has responsibility for the successes or failures of the team.
This implementation has caused many cracks in the relationships between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are associated with excellence standards like conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual teams are very useful as points of contact for their direct physical groups.
They often have a lot of autonomy compared to conventional teams because teams can meet according to designated work zones which may not be preferred by their local management.
The existence of "a genuine team without a leader" (Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"A team that is not biased" is a management team where every member reports. A team that is not biased discusses the standards in front of each member.
What causes organizations to always proceed by going through paths that allow them to build a learning organization? One objective is to apply the concept of an organizationâ€™s learning aimed at genuine innovation practice.
All resources available are utilized effectively in a functional area of â€‹â€‹an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be implemented.
Therefore, the process with organizations that work together to tackle what is being encountered aims toward a new innovative process to better serve customer needs.
Before the organization can become innovative, the leadership must cultivate a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve sustainable performance improvement.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of theoretical approaches to understanding cognition. Its necessity sharpens the research area and makes it more precise.
The relationship between pathology and brain function supports scientists in their research.
It is known that chronic seizures can be caused by brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors, which interfere with behavior and cause changes in various mental functions.
The existence of new technology allows us to observe and understand brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building a simulation model that helps us understand the processes that occur in our thoughts.
Although AI is often associated with science fiction, AI is a branch that is very important in computer science, associated with performance, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines for tasks carried out automatically that require intelligent performance.
For example, beyond control, planning and scheduling, skills in providing diagnosis and customer inquiries, as well as recognition of voice and handwritten characters.
Such approaches have become a distinct discipline that focuses on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are increasingly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they have already been developed in various computer software applications and video games.
A field trip is an important part of any classroom experience. The excitement of teachers taking their students to a place where riding a bus is not just an option.
Technology provides opportunities through virtual tourism. Students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or enjoy official art performances without leaving their classroom.
Developing virtual tourism is also a good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with upcoming classes.
For example, every year students from Benner School in North Carolina design a website during their trip to the state capital, every year the website gets updated, but the old version is kept online as a memento.
Blogs also help by improving students' writing. Many students start their blog experience with poor grammar and spelling, making the general audience change them.
Because blog readers are a very critical audience, the blog writer started trying to improve their writing to address the criticism.
Also writing a blog "forcing students to become intelligent in facing the vast world that lies before them." The aim is to prepare students' interests by giving insights to make them knowledgeable and engaging (Toto, 2004)
Writing a blog is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration, and supports students in developing learning far beyond traditional school days.
Using a blog can "empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively providing internet material, students can determine their position within the context of other people's writings as well as an outline of perspectives for matters that arise" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual and official capital of Canada and has various art galleries and museums that showcase Canada in the past and present.
South there is the Niagara Falls and to the north there is the natural beauty of the Muskoka homes and their surroundings that are yet to be utilized.
Everything about this and other aspects concerning Ontario, such as what is generally considered to be Canada by outsiders.
The area in the north is very distant and mostly consists of hills and various forests that are uninhabited by humans.
In terms of the comparison with populations that have many children: There are more African American children living in the US compared to Canadian citizens.
The African islands are located in the Indian Ocean in the middle of the eastern African sea.
Madagascar at present is the largest, and it is even considered a separate continent when it comes to wildlife.
Many small islands are independent countries, or associated with France, and appear more like beach resorts.
Arabic traders also brought Islam to these countries and wrote a major path in Comoros and Mayotte.
European colonialism and exploration began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
This domain is bordered by the Sahel in the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
A woman: He must have said that to every tourist woman, claiming that he is married, whatever his actual marital status is.
It is very helpful to use a cane (but it doesn't seem very expensive).
Women should understand that cultural activities can sometimes involve inappropriate behavior or harassment, either verbally or physically, for example.
Exercise means particularly for men, and don't be afraid to push yourself (whether culturally traditional or not, it is inappropriate either way!).
The modern city of Casablanca was built by Berber sailors in the 10th century BCE, and was formerly used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese renovated and rebuilt it, calling it Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after being hit by an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt this city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who traded there.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places for shopping in Morocco.
Arriving in Medina, we spent a long time looking for places that sell traditional Moroccan items such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of trinkets, but they were all offered to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was overwhelmed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which destroyed many of the city's roads, especially in the city center.
If Goma is quite safe, each visit from the Goma side must be scrutinized by observing the battle conditions that exist in the North Kivu province.
This city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with tracking several mountain Gorillas found in Africa.
He/She can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Due to its limited access, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a city in decline, even though it has a reputation as a tourist destination and has an airport.
In the year 1990, it was included in the list of world heritage sites considered in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
This is one of the main supports during the special PBS wonder in Africa from Henry Louis Gates.
This city is very different compared to most cities in that country, because it has more Arab influences than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bounded by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the west.
This park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the main tourism destinations in South Africa and it is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Like all National Parks in South Africa, there is a daily conservation fee and an entrance fee to the park.
This also provides benefits by purchasing a Wild Card, which offers the opportunity to choose various parks in Southern Africa including all Southern Africa National Parks.
Hong Kong Island provides the area known as Hong Kong and is a place frequently visited by many tourists as a major focus.
Skyscrapers that create the Hong Kong Skyline reflected in the bar graph that looks translucent can be seen thanks to the existence of water in Victoria Harbor.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side of Kowloon Bay.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shoreline.
This is a place where the British colonizers took control and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past with this area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest littoral mangrove forest in the world, extending about 80 km (50 mi) inland across Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans is known as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area located in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just mangrove forest â€“ it includes various remnants of what were once covered by the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of approximately 3,850 km2, about one-third of which is covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer can be found in this area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) late at night, although many, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart around 06:30 and 07:30.
Because the buses between districts are often full, it is advised to buy tickets several days in advance.

The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, not open to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge was scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoint was also completed.
The Guarani are an indigenous group mostly situated in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence farming.
The Chaco region is a home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who traditionally live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "giant province of the Indies," emerged as a result of meetings between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.

The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is mostly used in parity with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at one of the banks on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West Store.
British pounds are usually accepted in most locations on the islands and in Stanley, with credit cards and American dollars also widely accepted.
On small islands, credit cards are often not accepted, although in English and American companies it might be easier; check with your host in advance to find out the acceptable payment methods.
It was not possible to name the Falklands in the southern part of the archipelago, because they renamed them before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located on the south side of the Equator, there is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures above +30Â°C are common.
Winter can be very cold: temperatures often drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make us feel colder than what is indicated on the thermometer.
There are no "sabeh" and "tuh" seasons: usually, the sabeh is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the garden are accustomed to seeing humans, these creatures remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park staff, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from other wild animals.
There is no reason why its offspring, such as cougars, bison, elk, moose, bears, and other large predators are aggressive.
Year after year, dozens of visitors are bitten because they do not maintain proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and have the potential to pose a danger, making respecting their space necessary.
Besides that, be aware that you may encounter bears and other wild animals, therefore, make sure to store or cook food properly and keep the camping area clean.
What is the capital city of Samoa. This city is located in Upolu Island and has an old population of less than 40,000.
Founded in the 1850s, Apia has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.

Many places offer alcoholic drinks at their locations. However, you need to exercise judgment, and all gamblers understand the importance of staying alert.
Anyone who will travel at high altitudes or cross mountains should consider if there is snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is reduced and you cannot drive like you do on asphalt roads.
Inside the snow storm, the snow was so strong that it caused him to get trapped for a long time quickly.
A driver's vision may also be limited by falling snow, blowing snow, or by condensation and frost on the windshield.
On the other hand, mild temperatures and plenty of snow were experienced in many countries, and traffic continued to run mostly without interruption throughout the years.
A safari is indeed a major tourist attraction in Africa and it is something that appeals to many travelers.
The term safari in popular usage is given to land travel to see African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Many animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles and standard equipment to cause good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are over there, resting, and you will be able to observe them better using binoculars.
