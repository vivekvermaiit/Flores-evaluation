This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but also offers details that are not found so frequently in fossils, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was light or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs, known as rachis, do not have a well-developed shaft, but they do possess other characteristics, such as barbs and barbules. In view of this, researchers concluded that the rachis was possibly the result of an evolutionary development later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for display or temperature regulation. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has adult plumage, not that of a hatchling.
The researchers suggested that, although the tail is from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

The police reported that they suspect the person responsible for the attack is an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant.
They discovered that the sun operated with the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is regarding magnetic inversions.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a kind of halo around the galaxy and is composed of various tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He warned that the new variant was "very concerning and alarming due to the high mortality rate," in an interview.
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital and at least two were healthcare professionals.
In the period of one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on planet Earth, which tend to maintain a very constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, of the Astrogeology Team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral legislation codifies the procedures quite rigorously.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelope is present at the beginning of the voting and that no envelope is added, except for those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, achieved the tenth position in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 slower than the first place finisher, the Australian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss and recovered her cellphone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, stated Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Despite three people being inside the house when it was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital, in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the justice system in Scotland operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be heading in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test were under close supervision by the forestry engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited in accordance with the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of Conservation and Heritage of NPWS Park, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to advance the country towards new elections.
The commission was the response given by Martelly to the widespread protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating issues have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report delay "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time. In GMT, it was on Friday at 21:19.
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said that no damage was reported in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Afterwards, the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He educated himself as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Although he was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his free time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels said: "Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even more... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those who oppose the change in Australia, to become a republic, increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 campaign for the national election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was put into doubt.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, as these are prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have been a source of water distribution to the Earth along with the organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his government earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politicking and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transportation and surface trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking facilities and connections to public transport will not be available.
The problem of lack of transportation has increased the possibility of the game having to be held behind closed doors, without the presence of fans.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to the breeding between Darwin's endemic finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any type of form. It can even be rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched to form a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and bonded to another metal. Because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture from the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flushable toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remaining parts of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
There were also restrooms in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, restrooms were sometimes part of public bathhouses, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket more than 30 meters tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel did for us was to give us much easier and faster transportation.
Gave us the train, the car, and several other forms of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pets) that eat much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The revelation for their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat performs which prevents them from competing with one another.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and offspring.
Women tend to be closely related among themselves, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of words shouted and growled.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They capture monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey by scent, sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and are also able to move stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the surrounding environment and then attack their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to an island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics than it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We refer to this process as speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses using plants and make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we consume is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its era, therefore, the only thing it feared was other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the roof of its mouth, which shows that nothing crossing its path could escape.
We are not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not be a match for him.
Although most of their foods were familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that, while the poor and the women ate sitting in chairs, rich men liked to hold banquets together where they would lie on their sides while having their meals.
The diet in ancient Rome did not include foodstuffs originating from America and Asia to Europe, as happened in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomato, nor potato, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of its respective god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard, the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, upon traveling west, found Greenland and gave it its name.
But, regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears in the bottom corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, at the beginning of its existence, the great parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
In this way, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and the subsequent battles on D-Day liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy." They were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also, in some way, defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization involves the transfer of knowledge across different generations, a lasting cultural impact, and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — with Congress being its only component — according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who generally did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
Additionally, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent among all states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italy national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago."
The foundation of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region named the place Ilha Formosa.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the limits of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they were originally like.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of still image photography on the planet is the 35 mm format, which was the film size most widely circulated at the end of the analog film era.
Currently, it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its proportion has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is, in fact, confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the smallest ratio between whole numbers) is, therefore, 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or very close to this ratio.
The quite abused and frequently demoralized law of thirds is a fairly simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by its influencing power, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the hostilities began, Great Britain started a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, with the cutting off of vital supplies for both military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international regulations outlined in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to ships under a neutral flag.
Germany, since there was a limited response to this tactic, expected a similar attack to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States penniless, with a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China; thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, following the Revolution, positions were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as instead of ranks being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, provides a very vivid image of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Resting at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
It is not possible to see anything beyond the clear blue sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, features several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest in size), various small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward pointing arc" mark looks similar to a V, and the "downward pointing arc" mark looks similar to a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Cima means that you should start at the tip and push the bow; baixo means that you should start at the frog (which is the place where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general, an upward bow produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but do not forget that printed bow markings exist for a musical reason, therefore, they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Maria Teresa and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At a certain point, a protester brandished the head of a dead royal guard from Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on floating rate bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
It is clear that the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a series of ideas in practice, from the provision of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: the first is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Meanwhile, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health system to heal injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, led to citizens being shaped and, over time, customs and culture linked to this geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the possibly mandatory laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic language reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the garments were heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began developing its own style. One of the greatest advancements of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is the farming carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, generally organic system that uses native seeds saved from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to turn to the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of these children were confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child occurred due to the rejection of the child by the parents because of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are rebellious may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood before being abandoned or having run away from home.
It is assumed that others were created by animals; it is said that some lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular pet, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or in-person; in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that little talking paperclip from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software with the objective of questioning, alerting, and explaining procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for, and educate, but this happens.
We see the Foster Care System as a safety zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has the duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education, and guaranteed medical care.
Foster care is supposed to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuity relationships" were also identified as new characteristics of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that a person can detect if another person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, nevertheless, capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: cryptic and overt.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, to meet its amino acid requirements.
Furthermore, not acting accordingly leads to severe consequences: severe depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant-based resources with the greatest accessibility would be leaf proteins and legumes, but they are difficult for us primates to digest unless they are cooked.
Meanwhile, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" more or less like the current savanna chimpanzees do.
Sleep interruption is a process that involves deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly after (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a somewhat quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without fully waking him.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace correlates inversely with their level of bodily and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years, and indeed, there would be leadership of reinforcement troops on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed, and the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The work of Navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move people and goods while, at the same time, interfering with the ability of their enemies to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At that very moment, the German Navy was trying to disrupt this traffic, primarily using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains, in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the most well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were constructed in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on the somewhat rougher roads.
Sleepers were implemented very early on to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a metal cap on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron tracks were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Your predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Adaptations for bipedalism are found in Australopithecus fossils dating between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked upright on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of the human race, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of man.
After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to a printing office of John Dunlap.
During the night, around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The biggest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to this particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects well-structured to cling to human beings.
Both barber beetles and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research showed that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their interest or in their child's interest.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, only experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses and ask questions. Making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself distanced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various rhythms observed in physiology and behavior typically fundamentally depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not absolutely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate in a continuous cycle period, even without environmental interference.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can present a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns in the countryside to work in other cities and encounter other people who work precisely in those small towns they left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a transportation system based on private cars.
Science today indicates that this carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape more easily from enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because the planet Earth doesn’t seem like it’s moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes nearly 10 km wide.
A total of 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancients of the New Kingdom of Egypt marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since antiquity, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because all can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the Universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so astonishingly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a less important role and use.
Currently, people write messages through computer screens and do not need to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb operates based on the principle that energy is needed to construct a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's more or less like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The division of the nucleus then releases a bit of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker beneath the mountains.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what is in certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general terms, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum tries to remain as "part of the guys' group" (or girls').
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, adopting disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, delegating, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that everything the team has done must be changed and done their own way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often ends in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must maintain the same standards of excellence as teams considered conventional; however, there are some subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team generally act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may be in different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization wish to undergo the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical objectives of the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity become apparent.
As a result, the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Even before an organization is innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels in their performances.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Therefore, they narrow the research area and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to address customers' issues and diagnostics, as well as handwriting, voice, and speech recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is integrated into various software applications of home computers and video games.
Study visits are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places for which a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field lessons. From the classroom, students can see museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students from Bennet School, in North Carolina, develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the site is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a memory book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Since students often begin their interaction with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve the writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The necessity to engage the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by interacting with Internet content actively, students can position themselves within the writings of others, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and features a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
The Niagara Falls are further to the south; the north, in turn, holds the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Due to all this and much more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further to the north are also quite sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
For the purposes of a comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, at a distance from the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest, and a continent unto itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which gained much popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is advisable for all female travelers to say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that they might consider as harassment, and it's not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when refusing men. Do not be afraid to stand your ground (whether due to cultural differences or not, it does not mean it's all right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historic part of Medina, it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather items, hookahs, and a lot of trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, mainly the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing battle in the Nord-Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the more affordable mountain trails with gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, due to its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In the year 1990, it was placed on the list of World Heritage in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the Wonders of the African World program by Henry Louis Gates, broadcast on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country because it has a more Arab than African touch.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 Km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, just as there are for all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to acquire a Wild Card. With it, you can have access to several parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the place many tourists consider as its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar chart made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose to live, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest stretch of mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just home to mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great jungles that once covered the Gangetic surface remaining.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², with one-third of it covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interdistrict buses are almost always full, it is advisable to purchase the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, in Brazil, and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to begin operation in September 2017, the date anticipated for the completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies," emerged from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards initiated the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been successful in preserving many of the characteristics and identity of its indigenous populations.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To stay informed about tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are accepted.
On remote islands, it is unlikely that credit cards will be accepted, although British and American currencies may be received. Please check with the owners in advance to find out what payment methods they accept.
It is practically impossible to change Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains essentially the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, elk, and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they did not keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so do not approach them.
Furthermore, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals; therefore, avoid carrying or cooking foods with strong odors and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a well-known naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 German and American lives perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is situated between two bays. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the northern coast (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the sophisticated suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is quite safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It isn't a sophisticated beer, but it is enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines may go down better.
The local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but bottled water is easy to find if you have concerns.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "espresso", the cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes, which occur on the reef, are rare.
Continue complying with the authorities' reminders, obeying all signs, and paying close attention to security alerts.
The box jellyfish occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is the river estuaries located north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep upon arriving at their destination.
Travel agents usually do business with specific hotels, although it is probably possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping parks, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also secure your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, if there are any changes or requests, they must first be sent to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to stay close to the action, you'll need to arrive earlier to camp near the music.
Remember that even after the music ends on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue playing until late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice generates a terrible noise for the most sensitive.
The cruises in Saint Petersburg include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos generally make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of maintaining sobriety.
Whenever someone is driving in areas with high latitudes or on mountain roads, they should take into consideration the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, it's possible for enough snow to fall to leave you stranded in very little time.
Visibility may also be reduced due to falling or blowing snow, or due to condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the apple of the eye for many visitors.
The term "safari," in its colloquial use, refers to overland trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, primarily in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the basic equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
Also known as "bush walk," "walking safari," or "stroll," a walking safari involves walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, the majority of cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most of the tickets for the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for loan, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like to use ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric heat up too much (which can cause it to shrink or, in more severe cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient; in others, many minutes are necessary.
The quality of filters varies and, if you are in doubt, it might be good to consider the possibility of buying water gallons from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they are not familiar with in the regions they come from.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst-case scenario, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people through force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the chance to buy goods exempt from taxes and fees in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, who frequently pass through isolated wilderness areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be cautious: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - commonly 55-65 km/h - and strict adherence to them is even more important than the contrary.
Curiously, however, the cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good, and in Bavaria, they are well-crafted and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit sweets are common, with baked apples in the sweets all year round, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.
Many goods from German bakeries also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The famous cakes often pair very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of Northern India and in Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and in other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a spectrum that encompasses a wide variety of regional kitchens found throughout the country.
But, if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant Javanese condiments being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
To support a rider's feet, stirrups are used, which hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they can present safety issues, as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one of their feet caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the animal ends up running away. To reduce this danger, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, a large number of pilots wear riding boots with heels and smooth, rather narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, mainly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
As the main climbing destination in Chile, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The meetings include exciting views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes among their infinite potential of walls.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important activity on the trip for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations just to ski at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in the year 1861, the first recreational ski team was established by Norwegian citizens in Australia.
Ski backpacking: an activity also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related, but generally does not involve tourism for alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than on foot — but you will only very rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions like a country in this regard.
If you stay in this area, it is possible to cross the border without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, possessing a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the member countries of the Schengen area separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many other professional classes.
As much as it is a tradition, not all Sami participated in large-scale reindeer herding but lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer mainly being used as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are going to visit is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
It is also advisable that you consult other governments besides your own, but their advice is made for their respective citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may experience different situations from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The viewpoints presented are usually superficial, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and includes different types, which vary according to geographical location, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of harsh weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include snowstorms, as well as blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to stay alert to any risk of bad weather in their region, as this may affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, one must first receive professional training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile environment course' will usually provide the address of a local company.
A course will typically cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves role-playing, various first aid, and sometimes, weapons training.
Books and magazines about jungle survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning sex change surgery abroad must ensure they are carrying valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undefined gender (X), or updated documents to reflect a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is highly variable.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone gender reassignment surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backflow of water from the waves on the beach returning to the sea, usually at a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current to deep waters can form there.
Most deaths result from fatigue due to trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you manage to get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it would usually be.
Try to aim from somewhere you can't be caught or, depending on your skills or if you've been detected, wait for rescue.
Reentry shock occurs before culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapted easily to the new culture sometimes have a special difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People do not realize that patience and understanding are also essential for travelers who are returning home.
In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the light and sound show of the pyramid.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show begins.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in the year 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active as of the year 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the village of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut through by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone typically does not replace a cell phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with a view of the satellite.
The service is frequently used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone operator may provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who intend to have a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who finish school, allowing them to take a year off before university, without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can, in fact, increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Normally, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
For those who enjoy boat trips, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in a rather characteristic way (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two whole days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only embark on sea excursions, you won't need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany, in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if these people have never flown before or if they have ever been through a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and dislikes for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft function and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Transport companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important in the shipping of business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, depending on the route, it can take days to reach the landing and go through customs.
The only way to send it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is by spending a large amount of money for the privilege (or, better yet, having your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as basic rules, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the regular economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
In general terms, it's not even worth looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations were reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are marked by traditional red roofs, the 18th-century market, and the old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than classic Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on people's tombs.
It's worth walking half an hour through the intriguing village.
To the north, and easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after an exuberant account of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus travels to Sintra frequently, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (Reliquary), a place famous worldwide for Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are basically visiting a huge cemetery, as well as a place that holds practically incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here and many others, both Jews and non-Jews, whose loved ones were murdered or worked to death there.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the buildings with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, a large part understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because this is the language that has been established by law as the official language.
Even so, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the subway are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inadequate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still good behavior, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will considerably facilitate the trip.
The brusque exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities due to varied microclimates, different soils, and different altitude levels.
The area also hosts a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and grouse, as well as various other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide clothing for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own attire, especially in bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile by the monk or nun.
Similarly, it is required that men wear trousers covering the knees.
It is possible to borrow clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable using these skirts. For men, there is one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available ingredient, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, no doubt, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out if a verb or adjective is being used in a substantive form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be observed are C and G, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
Additionally, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar booklet will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It goes without saying that if you have knowledge of a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to not require separate study.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
As light pollution was not a problem in their golden age, they often meet in cities or university campuses, which are easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas that have favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" seedling.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you kicked out, without the right to discuss.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place and very easy to explore, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the Equator, you will have to deal with both the (constant) heat and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional cemetery of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby village of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a good theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Upper Middle Rhine Valley, or take a boat trip to the interesting points of the Danube or sail through the Erie Canal.
They also set routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of Spring and fertility.
The most traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, the mammals could not make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in the winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky gets dark at about the right time.
As the areas are sparsely populated and, consequently, light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to appreciate the stars.
In Japan, labor cultural relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are used to seeing.
Suits are the standard attire in business, and coworkers address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers generally need their superiors' approval for all the decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
