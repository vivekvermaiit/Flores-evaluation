Ring has also settled a legal dispute with the competing security firm ADT Corporation.
While an experimental vaccine seems to be able to reduce Ebola mortality, there are currently no drugs that have been proven to be clearly suitable for the treatment of existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially proved to be promising, but formal studies showed that it brought fewer benefits in terms of preventing deaths than hoped.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts it as an absolute necessity for the Olympic family to commit to a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs and their sport are better served by promoting meaningful changes within our organization rather than pursuing decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the topside and light or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but possess other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers speculated that the specimen, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult and not chick down.
A car bomb exploded in the police headquarters of Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring over twenty other people.

The police said that they suspect a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) behind the attack.
They have discovered that the sun operates based on the same fundamental principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, the luminosity and rotation are considered together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

The extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant is "extremely disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have been infected with the pathogen in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were medical hospital staff.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is apparently still small; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people who are infected at a given time in South Africa.

"They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which often have a rather constant temperature, but it is consistent with being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is listed, into an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the voter's identity, the voter casts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes at the start of the election and that no envelopes are deposited except those of properly counted and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in 10th place in the women's group with a combined run time of 4:41.30. With that, she was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four standing skiers did not finish, and 45 of the total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom could not place in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The Chief of Police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, stated that the defendants appeared in court with covered faces.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained significant head injuries.
The street where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
In the meantime, Adekoya was charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in pre-trial detention until charges are filed and a trial is held, but eyewitness statements may be distorted since her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is leading in the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a resetting of the borders to the state before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that are reportedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The shooters involved in the accompanying attempt to contain the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the attempt was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests critical of the regime that began in October.
The trigger for the partly violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
There have been over 60 cases of overheating reported with defective iPods. In total, this has caused six fires and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, the METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of over 34 further incidents of overheating, which the company described as 'not severe'."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Marianas said that no damages have been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and there are so far at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographers took the seat of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began using his free time to investigate premature labor.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestler colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said: 'Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman.'"
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was ... maybe even crazier ... I love her and will miss her ... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who are against Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents stated that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympic Games was supposed to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events and three medley relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his many complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain because they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous individuals confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, especially Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he might run for the office of President in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It resorts to satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to more precisely locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be arranged, and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities available on-site.
With concerns about a lack of transport options, the likelihood increased that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed within just two generations, although it was previously assumed that this process would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called illuminated manuscripts, in books that are referred to as illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, which were connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was transported into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our light and our view.
It requires a gigantic rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest service the wheel has provided us is much simpler and faster transport.
It brought us the railway, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats, which prey on medium-sized animals, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming house cats), that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has, ensuring that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with one another when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are just as deadly towards their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a series of gruffly roared words.
Ocelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell. They sniff the ground where the animals have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by visually blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g., when they cross a mountain range or a river or when they migrate to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population requires different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it becomes less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations then look so different that they can no longer be classified as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food through the sun via photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothing from plants. We mainly feed on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and might even have been a cannibal.
He attacked anything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
While most of their food may be familiar to us, the Romans did have their share of peculiar or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs. The rich men, on the other hand, preferred to hold joint banquets where they reclined on their sides while consuming their meals.
Dishes of ancient Rome could not contain any foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Offerings were made to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were constructed as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such great significance.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard. Shops simply consisted of counters open to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But independent of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true, however. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text is located upside-down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a marker.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
He was controlled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical records and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states initially formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of Congress.
The Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the authorities of the states to enforce all its laws, who often did not cooperate.
Moreover, he had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European seafarers passed by and documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a change in the grain cultivation methods of the indigenous people and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which corresponds to the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being manufactured today, but even more importantly, its image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strictly speaking, the so-called 35 mm format measures, confusingly, 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that divide an image into thirds vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the important Christian doctrines states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the churches exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was being adhered to.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut the country off from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally recognized international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method for indicating different eras. Each time period in China and each family that held power constituted its own dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties, there were also unstable times of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place over 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, fierce wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of being based on class affiliation, army rankings were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed people of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things beyond everyday life. He often visited a cave, known as "Hira" on the "Nur" (Light) Mountain, to meditate.
The cave itself has endured through the ages and offers a vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
You see nothing except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures that were constructed to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upstroke" symbol looks like a V, and the "downstroke" symbol looks like a bracket or a square missing the bottom line.
Upwards means that you should start at the tip and push the bow. Downwards means that you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upstroke usually generates a softer sound, while the downstroke is stronger and more expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; however, remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, which is why they should normally be respected.
The panic-stricken King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the enraged crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the eyes of the horrified queen.
The war expenditures of the US imperialists during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people represented the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an age in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which consistently ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are more inherent than socially conditioned.
One could say, for example, that passenger cars inevitably bring about the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged in connection to this geography, and since they were in harmony with society's place, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined over the course of the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than what the Byzantine markets had to offer.
Around this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic method of cultivation that uses stored, native seeds of the ecoregion and combines them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring like-minded people together who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves from others in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood, were not socialized by adults.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were kept confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations.
Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If it was entirely raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within its physical capabilities) that are almost entirely consistent with those of its specific caretaker animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process simpler and more interesting, "scaffolding" takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that assists individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aids are built into the software and are intended to question, suggest, and explain work steps that the student might not be able to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to exploitation.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving, and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the foster care system provides a measure of security for these children.
Our foster care system is intended to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster home is supposed to cover all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions regarding the utility and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "enduring relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expressions.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated how people who can no longer understand language due to brain damage can still correctly assess the honesty of others.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior might be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation causes new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Outside in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Additionally, there are severe consequences if it is neglected: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way as the chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you are someone who sets the alarm forward in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so that you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluids before going to sleep (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect), so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person possesses inversely correlates with the level of tension in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the available life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute calm and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but has been expanded to include the path of love from Mahayana and numerous techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the end of the war, the clash of systems, developments, and culture caused the countries to become enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and, in reality, be fought out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed, and the only hope lay in a retreat and reorganizing along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having entered the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships for cargo transport is by far the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional task of the navy was to ensure that a country remains capable of transporting people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany probably could have conquered Great Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and hide.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures. The goats were looked after by goatherds, very similar to the more well-known shepherds; often, they were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, tracks for steps were built in England.
Although the guiding tracks consisted merely of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses, which pulled the wagons, to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Quite early on, sleepers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, it became apparent that rails carrying a band of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking upright around two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "Upright Man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
In many cases, this is merely like symptomatic treatment. However, if you want more than just temporary solutions, then we should find and address the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans have become more severe.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript did not endure through time.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still living today. We call them birds.
Many do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or as bits, to use computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
The best indication of poisoning by ingestion may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that the likelihood of developing MS is twice as high in women as in men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to take over parenthood.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works using the scientific method. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test intended to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and making observations.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often essentially rely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Behavioral patterns determined by a cycle, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can execute free-running cycles for a time, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material in question, and whether the cells in question are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, visiting parks, and learning information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to commute to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such grievances, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of facilities on the roadway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small refuges in which they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold back their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun is at the center of the motions of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, as it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since ancient times because they can all be found in their natural form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also proposed the theory that they transform into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Naturally, there are also other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe in its entirety is made up of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Consequently, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so that it has been relegated in status and usage.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come near a pencil sharpener.
It remains to be seen what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to rolling a heavy cart up a hill. If the core is split again, a part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they decay with very little or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is referred to as the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the mares and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there may be more maria because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during the course of their growing up.
These theories address what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behavioral tendencies can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who must do everything differently than the team did and makes everything their own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed according to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be accounted for by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to address customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching cognition. Thus, they delimit the research field and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
Emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines for the automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include management, strategizing and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important component for every school class. It is not uncommon for a teacher to want to take her students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Virtual excursions represent a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For instance, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state's capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to capture the audience's interest inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and articulate their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is distinguished by a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the untouched beauty of nature spreads out in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what outsiders perceive as typically Canadian.
Large areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as wildlife is concerned, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel zone, and in the south and west, by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be consistent when rejecting men, and do not hesitate to defend your standpoint (cultural differences or not; that certainly doesn't mean it's acceptable!).
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida, and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole spectrum of trinkets are sold, but that is all just for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center, beneath it.
While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the status of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short trip.
This, in combination with its relative inaccessibility, has turned "Timbuktu" into a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although Timbuktu is regarded as a tourist attraction and has an airport due to its reputation, it is nowadays an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in strong contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arab than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting a different wildlife.
He is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake for the territory of Hong Kong and is a focal point for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling bar chart, made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists claimed as their own. If you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is referred to as Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stretches of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer living there.
Buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus terminal (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are cozy and stable.
Shared taxis offer a quick and convenient way to reach nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening for traffic only occurred in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017. It is anticipated that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed by then.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day Eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of Indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the Great Province of the West Indies, arose in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in preserving much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched here at other times of the year.
You can find information on competitions and outlets for polo match tickets at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set to be on par with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West Store.
The British pound is basically accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards are also accepted. US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, but British and US currency might be; inquire in advance with the owners about which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct wet or dry seasons: The amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, elk, moose, bears, and practically all large animals may seem, it can still happen that they go on the attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them plenty of space.
Be aware that scents can attract bears and other wildlife. Therefore, avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of an inglorious naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships with the exception of a British cruiser were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence campaign organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland spans two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming opportunities, and most offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One." It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be easier to handle.
You can drink the local tap water without worries, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water as well.
For Australians, the idea of a "Flat White" coffee is foreign. A small black is "Espresso", Cappuccino is topped high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of the authorities, pay attention to all signs, and particularly focus on safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside this period as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that they will have a place to stay upon arriving at their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be addressed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers decide to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that music is still played in parts of the festival until late at night, even when the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the breaking ice causes quite terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg also allow time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally go to great lengths to keep guests on site for as long as possible and encourage them to spend a lot of money. There are usually neither windows nor clocks, and exits are sometimes hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and ensure that they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players understand how important it is to stay sober.
Those who want to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice, and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility may also be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari typically refers to a land journey to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and the standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "walking safari," or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Summer Games twice, having already been the host city in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies were not applicable until July 2020 due to the coronavirus, for which the Olympic Games were planned.
It is assumed that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average ticket costing approximately ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help with drying. Many hotels lend out irons and ironing boards, even if you're not present in the room.
If no iron is available or one does not want to wear ironed socks, one can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various methods for the purification of water. Some of these prove to be more effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, then you should consider purchasing your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Vermin can destroy food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are usually not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from customs duties and excise taxes at certain locations.
Travelers whose destination country has high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is probably the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are prevalent here.
The given speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than usual.
Yet interestingly, the mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite delicious. In Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, just like in the southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are widespread, with apples being used in pastries throughout the year and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, or other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, then try what is referred to as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a great variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when the term is used without additional attributes, it usually refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is widespread throughout the archipelago today, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. As flavor carriers, the Javanese prefer peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar), and a range of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are aids for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet might get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and gets caught with their foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse bolts. To minimize this risk as much as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Additionally, some saddles, particularly English saddles, are equipped with safety stirrups, which allow a stirrup leather to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world constantly discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports like skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and ride down a slope covered in snow.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally also known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It is similar to alpine ski touring or mountaineering but does not necessarily include them, as the latter are carried out in steep terrain and require much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route like a comparable hiking route.
Under good conditions, you are able to cover somewhat greater distances than when hiking – very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport controls if one wanted to travel through multiple countries.
However, in this respect, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a country.
As long as one stays in this zone, one can normally cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen member countries, saving time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universally valid definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition shows geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in regions such as North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products could be described as "antique" even though they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also significant for many who work in other professions.
Even in the past, not all Sámi engaged in large-scale reindeer breeding; instead, they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities. They kept reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Even though the term 'Gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma."
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you will be visiting, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than your own. However, their guidance is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The presented views are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruptions, or loss of human life.
Storms can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of them that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal storm phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are urgently warned to pay attention to any kind of severe weather affecting their area, as this can impact all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
"An internet search for 'course on hostile environments' will probably show the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, typically in combination with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on wilderness survival, but only a few publications on war zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo gender confirmation surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid identification documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies greatly.
The searches at security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals before their surgery should not expect that their privacy and dignity will remain intact when passing through the scanners.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that have broken on the beach, often occurring near reefs or similar areas.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and a rapid current leading to deep water can form there.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion when attempting to swim back against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes sooner than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When one returns home after a stay abroad, they have adapted to a different culture and shed some behaviors of their home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, the people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt in a new country.
One might not expect that patience and understanding are also required towards returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is quiet before the show begins.
Normally, one constantly hears the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of the sounds and the light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula transition here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4892 meters.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you need to be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including leisure vessels, as well as by expeditions that require data and voice remote connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is study programs and courses abroad.
This is particularly popular among school graduates because it allows them to take a gap year before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a gap year abroad program can actually improve your chances of gaining a university education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating tours. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, with every sixth or eighth person owning a boat.
This is indeed comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days while returning in the evening to stay overnight on the ship.
If you only go ashore as part of the shore excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: This is nothing other than personal fears and antipathies that very many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and the procedures during a flight can help some people overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of not having control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often, time is a very important factor for business documents, commercial goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies, difficulties arose.
When they shipped things by air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow luggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious method to fly in First or Business Class is to shell out a hefty wad of cash for the privilege (or better yet, have your own company cover the costs).
However, that's not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless to even look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at their destination quickly and comfortably and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive, and bustling business center located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city exudes more of an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some of the graves.
It's worth taking half an hour to stroll through the fascinating village.
To the north and in the immediate vicinity lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in vivid colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 regularly travels via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also visit in the north the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) – a place world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave as well as a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a substantial part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered there or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by attaching or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and nearly everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only given in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transportation and other institutions.
Normal announcements on the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate cliché, in Paris, you find your way best by presenting your best self and behaving like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make getting along considerably easier.
The harsh exterior of Parisians quickly disappears when you display basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech trees, spruces, and firs, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes, it boasts a remarkably large diversity of plant communities.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies, as well as many generally more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that extend beyond the knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries, there are wrap skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that extend over the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. For all men, there is one size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available ingredient such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns begin next to the word Sie for "you" always with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because one has to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used as a noun.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means "dear," whereas carro means "chariot."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand formulations.
If you speak a Romance language, it is naturally easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might too hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that one does not need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not the problem during their peak as it is today, they are typically located in cities or on university campuses, which are easier to access than those built in more recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are vast facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility within the imperial court's surroundings.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even 'just one' specimen."
If you visit a formally laid-out garden and "collect samples," you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place, where it is easy to find one's way around, and almost everything can be purchased upon arrival.
Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you must expect both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
There are also a few buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for vacation planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also represent popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the celebration have been adopted worldwide by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition of staying awake during Easter night at some open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with the community celebrations often starting at midnight, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Suits are considered standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, with the focus more on group performance than on praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees must seek approval from their supervisors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their bosses' instructions unconditionally.
