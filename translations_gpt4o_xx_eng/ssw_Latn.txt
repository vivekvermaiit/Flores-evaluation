This not only confirms that dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widespread belief, but it also provides information about the fossils, including colors and the arrangement of the three-part structures.
Scientists say that the animal's wings are dark above and have a lighter color on the edges.
The discovery provides insight into the evolution of bird wings.
Because pterosaur wings do not have the straight central shaft that is sufficiently developed, known as the rachis, but they have other wing structures — barbs and barbules — researchers concluded that recent rachis are different from those other structures.
The appearance of these feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that, although this is a minor fossil matter, the sample indicates the fatness of the ancestor not of the modern chicken.
Many scientists say that even though this is just the tail of a dinosaur, what they have found suggests that the wings belong to an old bird, not a young one.

Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in by the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP). This council has an odd number of members.
Fifth time at CEP for Martelly in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission decided to retain the position of CEP as part of the strategies to advance the country in the upcoming elections.
The commission was responding to the escalation of protests against the government in Martell that began in March.
Violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, which should have taken place in 2011.

The I-NextGen program claims that it can cause flights to fly shorter routes which will save billions of fuel each year and also reduce carbon emissions.
It uses advanced satellite technology differently from past technology to allow the wind to guide flights and provide pilots with accurate information.
There is no movement of purchased goods and other items that move above the stadium will not arrive at Wembley, and the building of car parks and the upper platform parking does not reach above the stadium.
The fear that there will be no traveling has caused the level to grow to the point where it is forced that the game is played without spectators.
A study released on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Many researchers from Princeton University in America and Uppsala University in Sweden reported on the new species in two generations, even though it was believed that the process takes a long time due to hybridization that occurs between the Darwin's finch, Geospiza, and the flower known as the cactus.
Gold can be molded into anything. It can be molded into small things.
The dough should be a smooth, flexible one that can be rolled and braided. It can be beaten by hand and also wrapped around a specific object.
The lead is made very soft so that it adheres to the metal. The lead is made soft so that it can sometimes be used to decorate handcrafted items that are painted in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called pH in chemistry. You can test this using red cabbage juice.
The color change of cabbage juice depends on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Combine the two powdered ingredients together and, with clean moist hands, shape into a ball.
The moisture of your hand interacts with its outside to feel differently and create a transmission.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had houses with toilets that used water to dispose of waste in almost every house, connected to an advanced waste disposal system.
Artefacts of pottery were found in the house of Minoan in the cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toys in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In civilized Rome, toys were sometimes a part of the household, and they were present where people bathed, and both men and women would enjoy themselves there.
When calling someone who is very far away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in the middle receives a call and then quickly sends it back to Earth.
The satellite was sent into orbit by a rocket. Scientists are using a telescope because the Earth's brightness makes it not clearly visible.
An unfailing rocket needs to rise more than 100 kilometers to place a satellite or a telescope in orbit.
Transportation has changed the world in amazing ways. The most significant thing transportation has done is to make us travel easily and quickly.
Trains, cars, and other modes of transport.
Underneath them, there are many types of predators in between in structure that eat various animals, from rabbits to millipedes and even deer.
In the end, there are many small cats (including domesticated and stray cats) that eat small creatures like insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success in their job position is that the chosen work one is in makes them not compete with others.
Lions are cats that love company, they live together in groups called prides.
Some of these people were great and important men compared to thirty famous women known in that way.
The female lions have a close relationship with each other, forming a large family made up of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves like a pack of hyenas or dogs, animals that are almost similar to lions (but not big cats) in behavior, and they also kill when they hunt.
A perfect messenger, a leopard can climb (even if it's not easy), it can swim, cover a long distance and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The lion is in the genus of big cats (Genus Panthera) that includes the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The way a cheetah roars is not the same as the majestic roar of a lion, but it roars in a way that shows it is angry.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they are available. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists say that wild cats track animals to catch and eat them (targeted game) by using their sense of smell, sniffing to determine where they are.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and they are stealthy. Animals called ocelots hunt prey by camouflaging with their surroundings and then leaping to catch the prey.
If a small group of living things (a small number) is separated from the main group from which it originated (such as when crossing a mountain or river, or migrating to another region so they cannot easily return), it tends to find itself in a different environment than the one it was in previously.
This new era has different sources and different competitors, so this new population will need new things to become more powerful competitors than they needed in the past.
The nature of people has not changed; they just need to get used to it as it was in the beginning.
Over time, as a new generation starts to acquaint itself with its new environment, it begins to gradually differ from the previous generation.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, the number of people in these two nations will have diverged to the point where they can no longer be considered the same species.
It is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable cause and an important part of evolution.
Trees purify the air breathed by people, they take in the air released from people which is called carbon dioxide.
Trees make their food with the help of sunlight through a process called photosynthesis. They also provide us with shade.
In our homes, we use trees to work and we weave clothes using trees. Many of the foods we eat come from trees. Without trees, animals will not survive.
Mosasaurs were formidable predators in their time, fearing nothing except other mosasaurs.
The jaws of this ancient creature had more than 70 teeth on the upper side, accompanied by an additional row above in the mouth, meaning that nothing would stand a chance if it crossed its path.
It was a massive creature, but it could have had a flexible neck. Its diet included squids, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could have been a cannibal.
It would attack anything that entered the water; even a large animal like a T. rex could not be compared to it.
Even though we are accustomed to a lot of their food, the Romans have their own unusual foods, which include wild boar, flamingo, sea urchin, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women eat their food sitting on chairs, the rich prefer to hold a banquet collectively lying down comfortably as they eat their meals.
The food of ancient Rome could not include ingredients originating from the Americas or Asia in recent centuries.
For example, they had cabbage, tomatoes, potatoes, garlic, and no one from ancient Rome ever tasted corn.
The people of Babylon were among those who built temples for their gods which were regarded as the home of the gods.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods using rituals and festivals to commemorate certain things.
Each temple has an open temple area and then an inner part where only the priest may enter.
The architectural times called Ziggurats were built to be part of the temple.
The place at the top of the mountain was a holy and sacred site of God.
In the hot region of the Eastern Time, the house was not such an important thing.

The men were cooking in the yard; the windows were open to view the street. The stones were used to build houses.
The large forests were exhausted in the place of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland had few people. The Norse sagas narrate that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland following a murder. He then traveled west and discovered the island which he named Greenland.
But beyond the things they discovered, the Eskimo community was already living there at that time.
Even though all those languages are regarded as 'Scandinavian', there were many differences among the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have ever watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not the truth. Even though it is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
At the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the words read "Declaration of the True Independence on July 4, 1776." This inscription appeared at the bottom of the document it was written on, written upside down.
Even though there is no information about who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, its large document (which was 29¾ centimeters by 24½ centimeters) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore it is possible that the written symbol can be added as a label.
The arrival of the soldiers and the battles that followed thereafter liberated northern France, but the south was still not yet liberated.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with those who entered instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, this invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Just two weeks in America and the French troops that had already been liberated, liberated a part of Southern France and were going to liberate the Germans.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a specific place.
The word civilization derives from the Latin civilis, meaning the needs of the community, which refers to the Latin civis, meaning the citizens, referring to the city, which in another way signifies the number of people of a nation.
The places that are ancient are the ones that are paramount in the world. Various cultures involve the transmission of knowledge across different generations, which ensures the enduring preservation of traditions and the dissemination of knowledge in a relentless manner.
Small traditional practices are disappearing without even being recorded in history as the world rapidly changes to become more modern.
During the time of the war for independence, the time when ten states formed one government which only had a legislative body - under the Articles of Confederation. That government was weak.
The Congress did not have the power to collect taxes, as there was no executive or judiciary, and it relied on state authorities, who were not willing to cooperate with it, to enforce all its measures.
It also stated the permission to disregard statutory laws and the judicial system established by the government.
The Articles needed agreement permission in all aspects in order to be corrected, and the aspects easily took over the government because their representatives were often absent.
The national football team of Italy, as well as that of Germany, are the most successful in the world, and the Italian team became the World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular games include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, golf, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and car racing F1.
Winter sports are popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in world championships and the Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to the cluster of Japanese islands, Japan is commonly referred to, in terms of geography, as an "archipelago."
The formation of Taiwan began back in the 15th century when European sailors passed by the strait known as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, where it began the transformation of indigenous grain production methods and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing rulers' army (1644-1912) took control of southern and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where it agreed to cede control over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, which are called the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The buildings at the end of the complex were reconstructed so that visitors can see what they looked like in the past.
In 1976, most of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common picture format used worldwide was 35mm, which became the most well-known film size when the production of analog films ceased.
It is still being built, but what is most important is that it has already been positioned with modern cameras now.
A 35 mm wide rectangular format, flat, with a length of 36 mm combined with a height of 24 mm.
This type of ratio (dividing by twelve to get the total number you can get) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Often, the usual formats (for example, the APS family of formats) match or approximately reach this ratio.
The third law is often misunderstood and frequently overlooked; it is a straightforward law that creates contrast and ultimately maintains the balance of the picture.
It is the place of success of the main learning where the lines that separate the image intersect with the lines going upwards and those going downwards (see example).
During this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which became wealthy and powerful, was scrutinized.
It has been more than a thousand years since Christianity caused the countries in Europe to unite despite speaking different languages and having different cultures.
To have the power to step over everyone from the king to the ordinary person.
One of the main teachings of Christ is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's money should particularly be used for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the law was being faithfully adhered to.
Soon after the escalation of the conflict, Britain began blocking German military ships.
This approach appears to be working, the closure of military and civilian enclaves, this closure violates the standard international law that has been established over several decades through various international agreements.
Britain placed a mine in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire sea, causing danger to ships not involved in the war.
Since it had a small number of respondents to this question, Germany expects a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare.
Around the 1920s, the idea of self-reliance within communities and nations was such that problems needed to be resolved through self-reliance and self-determination.
After seeing horrific things and cruelty during the First World War, nations had a desire to avoid this in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to America and agreed to work for the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) brought to Thomas Edison.
In the past, China had a different way of dividing time; each era in China or each influential family had a distinct form of sovereignty.
Also during the era of each dynasty, there was a division of regions. A time remembered for this is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Among the kings, there were violent conflicts between many people who lived in a high manner, fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was a very chaotic time in Chinese history. During this time, thousands of people died fighting for supremacy in Xi’an.
There are many social and political issues such as the implementation of the metric system, from complete independence in political systems to people contributing ideas and conditions to assist the government and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
Again after the reforms, jobs were opened to all men who applied so that those who wanted to succeed could succeed.
In a similar manner to the military, because instead of army soldiers being placed in a specific battalion according to their unit, they are now placed according to their performance level.
The revolution in France also inspired many oppressed working people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad used to have a great desire for a life beyond the discontented one he was living. He frequently went to a cave known as "Hira" in the Mountain of "Noor" (light) to meditate.
He created a tradition, which lasted for a long time, providing a clear image of Muhammad as a spiritual person.
Resting at the top of one of the northern mountains of Mecca, this summit is far from other places on earth.
In reality, it is not easy to find it even if one knows that it once existed. Once you are inside the cave, you become alone.
There is no visible place except for the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this land can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid structures constructed to honor the death of a Pharaoh.
Giza Plateau, also known as "Giza Necropolis," is a site for the dead in Egypt with several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest of them all), smaller tombs, smaller temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of these pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like a V, and the "down bow" symbol resembles an inverted square or base with the bottom part missing.
Up means starting at the end of the rope and pushing it, while down means starting at the top (where your hand is holding the rope) and pulling it.
A musical instrument with a high pitch usually produces a soft sound, whereas a musical instrument with a low pitch produces a powerful and dense sound.
You are free to write in your own words, but remember that printed materials are there for music reasons, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forcibly taken to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a group of market women. The King was very shocked.
In the car, they traveled and returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The council of the people advised the King and the Queen to keep the windows of their car open.
At one stage, a member of this group raised the head of the royal guard who was killed at Versailles before the shocked Queen.
U.S. war costs during the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
They were compelled to pay the U.S. tax when pressured to cover part of the cost and the interest of the bonds that had not been paid on behalf of the government of the Philippines to Wall Street.
Undoubtedly, the great benefit derived from this long-standing struggle of the Filipino people includes the basic gains against American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, a person must comprehend why it was necessary for them to be made in this way.
The years during which the events commonly took place are referred to as the High Middle Ages in the history of Europe, during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages opened the way for the Early Middle Ages followed by the Late Middle Ages, which came to an end around 1500.
Technological development is a term that encompasses many different ideas, ranging from the creation of new technological items to the examination of the suitability of technology for people aiming to regulate laws related to scientific laws and the way people perceive technology.
Often, statements about technology express two well-known ideas: that technological advancement follows a path driven by cultural values and political power, and that technology ultimately has an "impact" on societies beyond its creation, as opposed to existing in isolation.
For example, someone might say that having a car leads to the construction of roads.
However, the country’s national road network financially will not succeed by being used only for small cars, therefore new construction methods are being developed to reduce the costs of vehicle ownership.
The presence of many vehicles can lead to numerous accidents on the road, which results in the creation of advanced methods for treating injured people.
Matters of love have been profoundly influential in shaping culture, as noted by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Romanticism, which allows you to manage everything, is better than enforced laws passed by higher authorities. As time goes on, we see modern cultures following the trend of Romanticism.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was also regarded as the fashion capital of Europe.
Established as a major cultural center from around 400 A.D., it continued until 1100 A.D.
Their presence grew especially prominent in the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders brought back gifts, including silk fabrics and spices that were of higher quality than those available in the Byzantine market which was known for selling them.
It was during this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style emerged during the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
On the side of dressing, there was influence from the Eastern Byzantine tradition.
However, due to the scattering of communication methods, western trends are lagging behind by about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the period known as the Middle Ages, Western Europe began developing its own way. Another development of this time due to these religious wars was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Farming without the aim of creating a business is a type of farming done to obtain enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Farming without the intention of making a business out of it is simple, it usually follows a natural process, using saved seeds found in that area along with crop rotation or other simple production methods.
Historically, many farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together people with similar mindsets who feel marginalized by mainstream society and allows them to develop their understanding of who they are.
The customs below these others differ due to age, gender, stage of life, location, and/or the gender of the members.
Rights that reflect the culture of a diverse group of people, such as different languages, traditions, religions, politics, gender, geographical locations, or other associated realities.
Members of a tradition often demonstrate their identity by using distinctive methods and symbols of style, including fashion, behavior, and regional language.
One of the most common ways used to emphasize the importance of community gatherings is to obtain reports about children who are in inappropriate situations, or if they are neglected, face misfortune, or are deliberately abused, and the elders do not allow them to associate with other, older people.
Such children are called "besiganga" or those who are unusual. Some of the besiganga children were hidden from people (usually their parents); sometimes the abandonment of the child was caused by the parents' inability to accept the child's disability, whether it was mental or physical.
Children who grow up without caregivers often experience significant abuse before they are noticed or run away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have grown up in the wilderness on their own.
If a child is raised by animals that are not human, when the child returns from the wild, they exhibit behaviors (in terms of physical proportions) that are almost similar to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or alienation from humans.
Even though the use of projects makes learning easy and interesting, the method of teaching a teacher uses to support the student in acquiring knowledge and skills is what is most important.
The way of providing support for students in their studies is not a method of teaching, but rather assistance that gives each person the opportunity to learn something new, such as learning to use new software programs or starting a new job.
Teaching students in this way, a teacher can meet with students in technical subjects or meet them face to face, in other words, the teacher is the one providing this assistance but using the Microsoft Office tool.
Virtual Scaffolds are incorporated within the software to ask, request to do, and explain what the learner found difficult to do on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for various reasons including neglect, abuse, and threats.
There is no child who deserves to grow up in a place that doesn't nurture, care, and educate them, but it happens.
We see the orphan care program as a safe place for these children.
Our plans that drive development should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, high-quality education, and reliable healthcare.
A place of care for children must provide all the necessary assistance that was lacking at the place where these children were initially kept.
The internet includes both aspects of mass communication and individual communication.
Digital content on the internet easily leads to unexpected growth regarding its usefulness and how it's applied.
For example, "learning" and "entertainment" are praised as important things to encourage people who use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Joining together" and "continuing relationships" are also described as motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they asked people about their perceptions of websites.
Video recording results in the acquisition of important things in interpretation, in observing facial movement of the recorded person just for a moment.
With this knowledge, it is said that a person can see if someone is lying by observing their facial expressions.
Olive Sacks, in his book "The President's Speech," demonstrated how people who can't understand speech due to brain damage or other reasons can correctly assess intelligence.
Learning using modern methods and the internet enables these teachers to help students work together. As if the entire community is learning together.
Research conducted over the past two hundred years has shown that there are two groups of genetic structures: hidden structures and manifest structures.
Changes in conditions add to genetic diversity, and selections will eliminate from this specified set of variations.
Reorganization and restructuring prevent progress from occurring between the two generations.
In the wild, it is not easy for baboons, which have a human-like digestion, to satisfy their amino acid needs from the available plants.
Beyond that, failing to do so has severe consequences: depression, poor nutrition, and death.
We may quickly obtain it from plants, as it is a nutrient found in leaves and in things like beans, but it is hard to be digestible and absorbed without being cooked.
Similarly, animal foods (insects, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible in the stomach, but they also contain a lot of proteins that include all the amino acids.
Of all the things examined, we should not be surprised if our ancestors expressed their "problems" possibly in a similar way that monkeys do in our time.
Sleep paralysis occurs when you become aware that you are asleep on purpose and then you are sent back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
