In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, which means that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making progress with significant changes within our organization, rather than by the removal of certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion so courageously described by those who survived Larry Nassar remained undisclosed for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal — to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely spread, but it provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.

The finding also provides information about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called rachis, but have other feather characteristics — “barbs” and “barbules” — the researchers deduced that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult and not the thin and soft feathers of the young.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur in age, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the fur of a juvenile.

They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be regarding magnetic reversal.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for is caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon has a pull on the earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have reached the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way regular matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a type of halo and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very concerning and alarming due to the very high rate of fatalities."
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients might have caught the bug from the hospital, and at least two were hospital healthcare workers.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any particular moment in South Africa.

Infrared sensors show that the variations in temperature between night and day indicate that they are probably caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as constant as large caves on Earth which often maintain a rather stable temperature, but it is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper sheet indicating their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter casts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters' names.
The French electoral law codifies procedures in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Uka's weapon did not work while it was pointed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider has continuous pain, is blind in one eye, missing part of his skull, and his face reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider testified via a video link from a USAF base in his homeland.
Apart from Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races in the Championships.
Her first one was the Slalom, where she obtained a "Did Not Finish" in her first run. 36 out of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's seated group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch who took first place and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani who came in ninth.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom did not classify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious injuries to his head.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since then been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court accused of killing her son.
She is in custody until she is charged and tried, but any eyewitness testimony may be influenced because her photo has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom but Scottish justice works differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be in danger if they publish photos, etc. of suspected individuals."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comments would be made at least before the charge.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other covered subjects reported include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
Shooters in the supplementary trial for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest guards, as the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Parks and Wildlife Conservation with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive instruction in safety and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEO as part of a package of measures for the country to move towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to be held in 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods with damage due to overheating were reported, which caused a total of six fires and left four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it had been informed about the 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there were no damages reported in the nation.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a Tsunami.
A Filipino individual who was previously a police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was killed with firearms.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature birth during his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the baby's fetal lung.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two 'black boxes' which are the flight recorders.
Luna's fellow competitors also paid tribute to her.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Truly unique like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was unusual like me... maybe even more than me... I love her and miss her... let's hope that she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from the year 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the provisional Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believes Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey agree with this view and wish that Queen Elizabeth would be the last monarch of Australia.
At the voting extremes, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays of the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there were doubts about his health condition.
He could not take the necessary medication for his pain because they are prohibited by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery by using different hardware and software until the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water delivery to the Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began governing earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "gossip and political stupidity".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology as opposed to ancient land-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
Fears of lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" provided a report on the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer, due to the mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any kind of shape. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can then be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can become very thin, and be bonded to another metal. It can become so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of chemistry. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemistry.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (since Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a type of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of drainage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia, and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women would meet together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects it back down almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere bends part of the light and our view.
A giant rocket over 100 feet long is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The bicycle changed the world in unbelievable ways. The biggest thing the bicycle did for us is that it provided us with easier and quicker transportation.
He brought the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Beneath them, there are more medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including cats that are free-roaming pets) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task that each cat has which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and they live in large groups which in English are called "prides".
The groups ("prides") are made up of one to three related adult males, along with a maximum of thirty females and cubs.
Women, generally, are closely related to each other, since they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion groups act like groups of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and they are also very deadly to their prey.
A good athlete in everything, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull five times stronger than a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar loudly.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but more like a sentence of words shouted awkwardly.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by their scent, by sniffing the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from (such as by moving across a range of mountains or a river, or by moving to a new island so they cannot easily move back), they often find themselves in a different environment from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to appear less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands of years or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans inhale, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaw was filled with more than 70 very sharp teeth, as well as another set in the roof of her mouth, meaning that anyone who crossed her path had no chance of escape.
We do not know for certain, but it could be that it had a tongue split in two. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex could not defeat him.
While the majority of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent resembling a dormouse that hibernates a lot.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman would eat their meal sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have a dinner together where they would recline on their sides while eating their meal.
The meals of Ancient Rome could not include the food that came to Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they did not have wheat, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
The people used to make sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard in the temple and, behind it, an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women would do the cooking in the courtyard; the shops were simply an open counter facing the street. The stone was used for building the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Kangħan, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had a small population. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland due to murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, regardless of the discovery he made, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie “National Treasure”, you might think there was a treasure map on the back side of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th of July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large document made of parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated Northern France, but the South still remained unfree.
It was led by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On the 15th of August, 1944, the Allies invaded the South of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the South of France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a large and significant group of people living and working cooperatively, society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and in a certain way also defines the size of society.
Cities that are states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge from various generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—where Congress was its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce all its acts but, often, they did not cooperate.
He had no power to overcome the tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The national football of Italy, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest one being Honshu) and, therefore, this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical context, as an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the early 15th century when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of the West and North of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
A large part of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can have a clearer idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are of this aspect ratio, or very similar to it.
The often abused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His great power affected everyone from the king to the common farmer.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, thereby causing danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the terrible things and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid a similar situation occurring again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employment manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each stage of China and each family that held power were distinctive dynasties.
Also, between each dynasty there was a time of instability with the provinces divided. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these time periods, there was fierce warfare among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China where thousands of people died fighting to take the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants and this allowed those who were the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on class, army ranks were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has continued to exist throughout time, clearly shows Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy at all to find it even if someone knows it exists. Once you enter the cave, there is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except for a clear and beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), various small crypts, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts, and temples were built to honor the women and family members of Khufu.
The "up stroke" symbol looks like a V and the "down stroke" symbol resembles a staple or a square shape without the bottom side.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Playing upwards on a string instrument generates a softer sound, while playing downwards is louder and more assertive.
You can make the markings you want with a pencil, but remember that the bowing marks are there for a musical reason and therefore, normally, they must be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a violent crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd compelled the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of the royal guard who was killed inside Versailles in front of the Queen, who was horrified.
The expenses of the United States imperialism's war in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover the majority of expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events occurred was commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
Before the High Middle Ages there was the Early Middle Ages which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher occurrence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, resulted in customs and culture related to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the society's place, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a hub of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
His status deteriorated during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was greatly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because communication channels move slowly, Western styles can lag by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other techniques that are relatively simple to maximize yield.
Historically, many farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this still applies in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel forgotten by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a mixture of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by using a different and symbolic style, which includes fashion, manners, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or savage. Some feral children were abandoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of the child's serious intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When completely raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the particular animals that took care of him, such as his fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the teaching method called scaffolding is more effective.
Scaffolding is not a method of teaching, but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but even the small paperclip human in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
The Virtual Scaffolding is internalized in the software and aims to ask, prompt, and explain the procedures that might have been too challenging for the student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No children should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet this still happens.
We consider the Foster Care System as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, carers who offer their love, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet connects elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Particularly, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document “The President’s Speech”, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, nevertheless, able to accurately evaluate sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, the failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Plant resources that were the most easily accessible would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast to this, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high quantity of protein containing all essential amino acids.
When we consider everything, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" almost in the same way that chimpanzees living in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process where you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep period and go back to sleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm that wakes you up without completely waking you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, and this will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking a lot of fluids (particularly water or tea, a popular diuretic) before sleep, thus causing the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were expanded with the passage of Mahayana love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the idea that love accepts everything.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation lies the Yoga of the Deities. Through the visualization of various deities, one cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates a consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, disagreements in the system, process, and culture caused the countries to fight.
Just two years after the end of the war, those who were previously allies had now become enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and was to be fought for real, by alternative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already divided, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and items across the oceans.
The traditional role of navies has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which primarily used U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them in order to have an easy way to acquire milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that grazed on the hills or other pasture areas, and they were often tended by goat herders who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were constructed in England early in the 16th Century.
Although the wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
The "crossties" (cross knots) were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, gradually, the realization came that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on the top part.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more distress on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron lines were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) appeared.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. Nonetheless, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we need to find the source of the problems, and we need to deactivate it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become bigger due to the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who ordered that it be read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and pointed claws, they lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not appear immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning might be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with the Bedbug, which are insects well-suited as human parasites.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or in the place of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides much of scientific research.
However, it is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, which become questions, and making observations is also a guide for scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
The views of Aristotle on all scientific subjects, including psychology, were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain a period of free-running cycling even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.

Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns of the country by car to go to work and pass by others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states, which supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems create such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two places and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented approximately mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to begin flying. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back into place along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at some points it is six miles wide.
In total, 20 percent of all the water that is poured from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained the largest in size and the best in technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors which, at that time, were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is also the everyday language used by many of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as these can all be found in nature in their native form and it is relatively simple to mine for them using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the theory that everything is made from a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have an alloy that includes small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly minuscule that trillions of them fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now write messages on computer screens, and they never need to approach a pencil sharpener.
Who knows what will become of the keyboard when something newer is invented.
The fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy for a nucleus to combine with many protons and neutrons.
Similarly to when you push a heavy cart uphill. The splitting of the nucleus again then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split with little to no effort.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km wide on the nearest side and 100 km wide on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the "maria" and thicker under the "highlands".
There might be more moon seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on discovering what makes people happy or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of attitudes can result when managers start managing those who were previously their peers. One end of the spectrum is to try and continue being perceived as one of them.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary action, conduct evaluations, assign responsibilities, and ensure that people are held accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change every action the team makes and mark it as their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a conventional team because their teams can meet according to different time zones, and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.

Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of practically applying the concepts of a learning organization is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized within an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous Sequence approach as a method being used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Thus, this makes the field of research less vast and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
For a long time, it has been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain that we had never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and it deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research on AI involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and queries, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been integrated into various computer software applications in homes and video games.
Local trips are a big part of every class. Often, a teacher likes to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers the solution with virtual on-site trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a journey with others virtually is also a very good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, the website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have an audience usually leads to this situation changing.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins working to improve the writing in order not to be criticized.
Also, blogging "forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to be more engaging and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital city of Canada and features a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further to the south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north there is the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what is considered Canadian by foreigners.
Larger areas further to the north have a rather sparse population, and some are areas in a nearly uninhabited natural state.
For a comparison of the population that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest one, and a continent of its own when we talk about wildlife.
Many of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts on beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it spread significantly in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the North, the region is surrounded by the Sahel, and in the South and the West by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling says she is married, regardless of her current marital status.
It is useful to wear a ring too (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences may result in what they might consider as harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stand firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to insist on your preference (whether there are cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean you have to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru al-Badya and it was given the name “Casablanca” by Spanish merchants who established trade bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pottery items, leather goods, hookahs, and a full range of geegaws, but they are all touristy.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme East near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's roads, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to know the status of the fighting that still persists in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the bodaboda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The (local) normal price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special series “Wonders of the African World” by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts strongly with the other cities of the country because it has more Arabic elements than African ones.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park spans 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in South Africa, daily fees for conservation and park entry are applied.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all National Parks in South Africa.
The Island of Hong Kong (“Hong Kong Island”) gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as the main focus.
The deployment of the buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a bar chart with shining lights due to its appearance with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest littoral mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangroves in marshlands — they include some of the last remaining positions of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², about a third of which is covered by water/marshland areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave from the bus station between the districts (along the river) throughout the day, although many of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts have services of small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be ready.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region included other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, harvesting, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquistadors with native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley next to the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and United States currency may be accepted; speak to the owners in advance to see what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to change Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located in the Southern Hemisphere, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the entire year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals still remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how docile they may appear, bison, elk, moose (large deer of North America), bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
However, you should know that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking foods with strong smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was established in the mid-nineteenth century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of the infamous naval conflict in 1889 where seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the chief leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches because Auckland is located between two harbors. The most well-known ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and the majority have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located inside the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the center of Auckland.
These are sandy beaches for the family that sometimes get crowded and have a good range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," it is not a complex beer, but it is enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines you can find, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia probably travel better.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of a coffee called “flat white” is not unfamiliar. “Short black” is “espresso”, cappuccino is filled with a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is according to Belgian standards. The fruit juice costs a lot of money but it is excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nonetheless, you should seek advice from the authorities, follow all the signs, and be very attentive to safety messages.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. Occasionally, one can also see them outside of these times.
Although sharks exist, they rarely attack people. Many sharks are afraid of people and swim away from them.
Saltwater Crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If he books in advance, the traveler will have peace of mind knowing he will have somewhere to sleep upon arriving at his destination.
Travel agents often make arrangements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and even packages that combine the flight and the hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need more time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendment or request, however, should go to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those who attend music festivals decide to camp on site, and many of them consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may be over, there might be sections of the festival that keep playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, pay close attention to the cabin location because when passing through the ice it makes a terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money that guests spend in them. Generally, there are no windows and clocks, and it can be difficult to find the exit points.
Generally, they have special offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will drive in high latitudes or cross mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, there isn't much friction and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During strong ice storms, enough snow can fall in a short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly without interruptions all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to travel on land for the observation of African wildlife and wonders, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and standard equipment that allows for good views.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes camouflaged and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "going footing") consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be organized in other places in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, many coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing on damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for use, even if you don't have one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if it is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is enough, in others it needs several minutes.
The filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter elusive animals that they are not familiar with in the regions where they stay.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, inflict poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duty in certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, because it frequently passes through isolated expanses of backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there is a predominance of steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The maximum speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections — commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and strict compliance with them is even more important than otherwise.
However, curiously, the mobile service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German meals are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their Southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, and cooked apples are used in pastries all year round, with cherries and strawberries starting in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts from other trees. Famous cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try those that according to the region are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a spice-based dish, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "saucy" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Due to the fact that there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term that covers the great variety of regional cooking found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widely available in the archipelago, includes a range of simply spiced dishes, and the Javanese favorite predominant flavorings are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are a support for the rider's feet that dangle on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety issues due to the potential for the rider's feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, many riders wear riding boots with a smooth and fairly narrow heel and toe.
Consequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather strap of the stirrup to detach from the saddle if pulled back by a rider who falls.
Cochamó Valley - The main destination for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various large granite and rock walls.
The highest points include spectacular views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes amidst the endless potential of its walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downhill on snow-covered ground on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient — cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by the Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking with skiing: This activity is also called "backcountry ski", "ski touring" or "ski hiking".
It is related to, but generally does not involve, ski touring or alpine-style mountain climbing, where the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than if you were walking – but it is very rare that you will achieve “cross country” skiing speeds without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent countries. Usually, to travel through multiple countries you have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, works somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having to go through the passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thereby saving time, money, and documentation.
There is no universal definition for what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
The herding of reindeer is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture around the trade is also important to many people who have other professions.
Even traditionally, despite this, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, and had the reindeer mainly as animals to pull heavy loads.
Today many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although it is widely used, especially among those who are not Romani, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also consider consulting the advice of other governments and not your own, but their advice is tailored for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
A consultative report is a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often quick, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rain, and wildfires are types and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include intense hailstorms, snowstorms, snow squalls, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks that may affect their area as it may impact their travel plans.
Anyone organizing a visit to a country that can be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
An Internet search for “Hostile Environment course” will probably yield the address of a local company.
A course typically covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2-5 days and involves role play, a lot of first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but there are not many publications about war zones.
Travelers planning a gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies in the same broad manner.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow that returns from waves that breaks off from the beach, often in a sandbar or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and can form a swift current for the deep water there.
Many deaths occur due to exhaustion after trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it won't be any more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try aiming somewhere where you don't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might prefer to wait for rescue.
The shock of re-entry comes before the culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be stronger.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your country's cultural habits.
When you traveled, at first people probably were patient and understood you, because they know that travelers in a new country need time to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also required for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the children's section.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Generally, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest one is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the sunken caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region to the south of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here join in the plain, then emerge again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The Northern Party or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cellular phone coverage, the satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including leisure boats, as well as expeditions that need to communicate remotely by voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An option that is becoming more popular among those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with those who finish school, allowing them to take a year before entering university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing toward higher education back in your country.
Typically, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a very good destination for sailing. The "Land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
Many of the distinguished cruises in the Baltic include an extended visit in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while at night you return and sleep on the ship.
If you leave on land only by using excursions on board, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced some traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fears and personal aversions many people have towards other things.
For some, if they understand a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight, this can help them overcome a fear that is based on what they do not know or on things they have no control over.
Courier companies are paid well for delivering items quickly. Often, time is very important in the case of commercial documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the big companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If you sent the cargo items by air, on some routes it may take days to clear customs and unloading.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this will not be cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally, it doesn’t make sense to look for discounts on business class and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain important group of air travelers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of reaching a destination quickly and in comfort, and they charge for these things.
The capital city of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the East of Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova even though the political negotiations did not succeed.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
That which was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling business center, built around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one finds interesting marble sculptures of doves on certain graves.
Don't you mind spending half an hour strolling around the intriguing village.
To the north and easily reached lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after the praise-filled description of its great beauty expressed by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Furthermore, in the North visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Chapel), a site of Marian apparitions known worldwide.
Please remember that, essentially, you are visiting a site of mass graves, as well as a site that holds almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who are alive today who managed to survive the time they spent there, and many more who had their loved ones killed or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half the people prefer to speak Catalan, the majority of people understand it, and practically everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are marked only in Catalan because it is legally established as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used extensively in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, cold, and arrogant people.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave well and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This significantly helps in coping more easily.
The unfriendly attitudes of Parisians quickly dissipate when you show them basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with many trees, mainly beech, spruce, and pine trees, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and different altitude levels.
The area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the hawk, the lynx, the wild cat, and the wild rooster can be found there, along with many more common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Many monasteries provide shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each person wears them, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there is a one size fits all!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in every dish.
A popular and simple dish, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and the condiments that are available like cheese, oil-packed tuna, etc.
All names, next to the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
Certainly, this facilitates reading, although the writing is a bit complicated due to the need to ascertain whether a verb or an adjective is used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters you need to watch out for are "c" and "g", because their pronunciation varies depending on which vowel follows them.
Besides that, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means expensive, while "carro" means cart.
The Persian language has relatively easy grammar and, for the most part, regular.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Obviously, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete nowadays, and remain as museums or educational sites.
While light pollution at its height was not the type of problem we have now, generally these are found in cities or campuses, and it is easier to reach them than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The display of cherry blossoms, known as “hanami,” has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the peony flower was the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor for himself and only for other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally organized garden, collecting "samples" will also lead to you being expelled, without discussions.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost everything after you arrive.
But when placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to face both the (constant) heat and the intense sunshine (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses that go to the north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you plan to catch goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Internal waterways can be a good theme to base a vacation around.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruises to interesting cities on the Danube or boat trips along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of popular paths for long walks and cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the feast have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night in an exposed place to watch the sunrise.
Obviously there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often organize an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, and therefore the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon anymore.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis since the sky will be more or less dark all the time.
Since the areas have a low population, and light pollution therefore often does not cause problems, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Western people are accustomed to.
Suits are the standard attire for work, and colleagues address each other by surname or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the emphasis placed on group effort rather than encouraging individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain their superiors' approval for any decision they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without reservations.
