Although an experimental vaccine seems to be able to reduce the death toll from Ebola, no medication has yet clearly proven to be suitable for treating the current infection.
A compound, ZMapp, initially offered hope in the area, but formal studies showed that it had fewer benefits than sought after to prevent death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that researchers used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the Olympic Committee in the USA and recognizes the unconditional need for the Olympic family to create a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement from the USOC that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, can be better served by making significant changes within our organization, rather than denying certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuse on the scale so bravely described by those who were targeted by Larry Nassar could continue undetected for such a long time, and endorses all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal — to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible, so athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already common, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the plumage of this animal was dark brown on top, with a lighter or reddish underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the developmental process of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but still possess other features of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary modification compared to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but rather for regulating temperature or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the host exhibits an adult feather coat rather than the down of a juvenile.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the host shows adult plumage and not the down of a young one.

They noticed that the sun operated according to the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the systems turned out to be driven by their luminosity, their mass, and nothing else.
The light power and the turbulence are used together to find the Rossby number, which relates to the plasma flow, of a star.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic variations.

He cautions that no one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this moment will stop the sectarian strife, increasing violence, or a gradual shift into chaos.
The report begins with a call for open debate and to build consensus in the USA on the policy towards the Middle East.
The report is strongly critical of almost every aspect of the current policy of the executive power toward Iraq, and it encourages an immediate change of course.
The first recommendation of the 78 is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure the border around Iraq against hostile interference and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighboring countries.
The current senator and Argentine first lady, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced that she is a presidential candidate, last night in La Plata, a city 50 km from Buenos Aires.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was made to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The result the team was searching for would come from the gravitational force between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the universe.
Just as the Earth is pulled by the moon, creating high and low tides, the winter pathway also pulls the Sagittarius constellation.
The scientists managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo surrounding the galaxy, and is made up of many small particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new strain was "very concerning and gruesome, due to the extremely high death rates."
Some patients may have caught the bacteria in the hospital, says Doctor Moll, and at least two were nurses.
In a year, an infected person might potentially infect 10 to 15 people in their vicinity.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people who are infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature changes between night and day suggest that they are likely caves.
They are colder than the surrounding area during the day and hotter at night.
“Their thermal properties are not as regular as those of larger caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but they are common in the sense that these are deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, insert a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the candidate they choose into an envelope.
After officials verify their identity, the voter places the ballot envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
French election law organizes the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, so voters and observers can verify that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the voting, and that no envelopes are placed inside other than those of voters who have been properly approved.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the procedure. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following a precise procedure.

Her first was slalom, where she went out of the competition on her first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that competition.
In the other competition, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the sitting category for women with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the Eastern Claudia Loesch in first place and 1:09.02 minutes behind Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed their first runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in total in the giant slalom did not manage to make it onto the scoreboard.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the laptop and the cellphone.
D K Arya, the deputy superintendent, said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the accused appeared in court with concealed faces.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver received serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for killing her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but the evidence from witnesses may be compromised because images of her have been widely published.
This is a common procedure elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish courts operate differently, and the courts have assessed that publicized images may be damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee points out that “journalists seem to be on the borderline when they publish pictures, etc., of people under suspicion.”
The Ministry of Justice, which has overall supervision of prosecutions, has informed journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the prosecution is initiated.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the disagreement about the borders that Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
It is said that other subjects include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that military control remain in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian authority only agrees to allow such a presence for five years.
The forest rangers closely supervised the hunters in the additional pest eradication trial, as there was monitoring of the trial, and its effect was assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were provided under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the current manager for conservation of protected areas and public ownership with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting initiative received extensive training in safety and practice.
Martelly was sworn into a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the former CEP council to resign, as part of a comprehensive measure to lead the country towards new elections.
The council was Martelly's response to persistent protests against the government, which began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of iPods with malfunctions that overheat have been reported; they have caused six fires and given four people burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan (METI) said that it had been aware of the 27 incidents related to the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it about 34 more cases of overheating, which the company described as “non-hazardous.”
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by calling the delay of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Crisis Management Office in the Northern Mariana Islands said that there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the passengers with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, along with the Filipino journalists.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed a restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he worked at the hospital, Liggins started to investigate labor pains that come too early, in his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the fetal development of the child's lungs.
Xinhua reports that investigators from the government recovered two 'black box' recording devices on Wednesday.
The gymnasts also gave Luna recognition.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of a two-moon night. Quite lonely, like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was just as strange as I...maybe even more...I am fond of her and will miss her...hopefully she is in a better place."
Out of 1,400 people who were surveyed before the federal election in 2010, the number of those against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed in the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign is over.
34 percent of those in the survey also hold the view that they wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the outskirts of the survey, 29 percent of those asked believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there are doubts about his endurance.
He has not been able to take his medication, which he needs to overcome the pain, because it is not allowed in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various tools and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for providing water to the Earth, as well as organic matter that can produce protein and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets take shape; especially how the Earth took shape after comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month to allow same-sex marriage.
He referred to the talk as "political nonsense and foolishness."
One thinks that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology based on satellites, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transportation will be implemented, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the site.
Concerns about transport shortages provided the opportunity for the match to be played behind closed doors without supporters for the team.
A study, which was published on Thursday in the journal Science, reported the occurrence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, even though it was believed that the process would take much longer, due to breeding between a local Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin thread, which can be wound and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, called “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make a measuring tool by using red cabbage juice.
The red cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the substance is.
The oxygen amount (pH) appears in relation to the amount of hydrogen ions (H for hydrogen in pH) in the examined substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons, whose electrons are removed (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix both types of dry powder together and then squeeze them, with clean wet hands, into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layers, which will feel funny and create a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets that could flush in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewer system.
Remains of bee-keeping hives have been found in the houses of the Minoan towns in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a messenger.
The messenger in space receives the call and then sends it back down almost at the same moment.
The satellite was sent into space in a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere above the Earth distorts some of our light and view.
It requires giant rockets taller than 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the bicycle has done for us is to provide us with much easier and faster transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Under them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat a much greater number of prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind their good result is the concept of the elf, a special task each cat has, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups, which are called prides.
Groups are composed of one to three adult males, who are related, together with up to thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related to each other, a large family with sisters and daughters.
Pack animals behave somewhat like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that, as strange as it sounds, resemble lions (but not other large cats) in their behavior, and are also very dangerous to their prey.
A versatile gymnast, the versatile one, can climb (but not well), swim, long jump, and pull with the quintuple strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion with full force, but is more like a sentence with hissing, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can manage it. Almost all the animals that the ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They see well in the dark with night vision, and also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by concealing themselves in the environment, and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (e.g., if it crosses a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island making it difficult to return), it often ends up in a different environment than it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so this new species will need other qualities or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what it needed before.
The original institution generally has not changed, it still requires the same adjustments as before.
As the new institution begins to adapt to its new environment, it will resemble the other institution less and less.
Eventually, after several thousand or even millions of years, these two populations look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process we refer to as cladogenesis, which simply means the formation of new species. Cladogenesis is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jawbones were equipped with over 70 knife-sharp teeth, in addition to another set in the palate, which ensured that nothing that ran into him could escape.
We do not know for certain, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included, among other things, turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he might even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur, for example a tyrannosaurus rex, could not compare with him.
Although the majority of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans also had their peculiar or unusual things for feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and the women ate their food on chairs, the rich men liked having banquets together, where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
Old Roman meals could not have ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cake, and no Roman from ancient times has ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to attend to the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard, and an inner sanctuary that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special towers were built, in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of Hebrew families was conducted outdoors.
Women prepared food in the yard; shops were just open booths facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was exceedingly expensive.
Few were settled in Greenland. In Norse history, it is said that Erik the Red was outlawed from Iceland for murder, and then traveled further west, found Greenland, and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there are many differences among the people, the kings, the customs, and the history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not correct, though. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
Behind the declaration of independence, the words “Original declaration of independence dated July 4, 1776” were written. The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifetime, the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored away.
So it is possible that the memo was inserted only as a sign.
The invasion on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
He controlled the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called “Operation Dragoon.”
After only two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture that a significantly large group of people have in common, and who live and work interactively, a society.
The word civilization (civilization) comes from the Latin civilis, which means civilized, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it also somehow describes the size of the society.
City-states precede nations. A civilized culture refers to transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, a gradual cultural footprint, and good dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence behind and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first established a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and, since there was no executive authority or judiciary, it was dependent on local authorities, who often were not cooperative in implementing all its laws.
She also did not have the authority to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
The statutes required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states cared so little for the central government that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second-best team in the world and were FIFA World Cup world champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic competitions.
In Japan, there are nearly 7,000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because Japan has a group of islands, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical context, as an "archipelago."
Taiwan has its beginnings all the way back in the 15th century, when European sailors, who sailed past, recorded the island under the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a station in 1624 in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a change in the original cereal cultivation, and employed Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control in the coastal areas west and north of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Empire.
After a defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where it cedes its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts have been rebuilt so that tourists can better imagine how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was reconstructed, and the restoration has been ongoing until now.
For example, the most common single image size in the world for photography is 35mm, which was the most common image size during the last period of the analog photo era.
It is still produced today, but of even greater significance is that the aspect ratio is also used for sensor sizes in digital cameras.
The 35mm size is actually a bit strange, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The size ratio of this quantity (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio with whole numbers) is called 3:2.
Many common sizes (e.g., sizes in the APS family) are equal to or close to this size ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused or mocked, is a simple guideline that gives the image dynamism, but also maintains some sense of order.
She says that the best place for the main subject is where the lines that divide the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect each other (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was closely scrutinized.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European countries, despite them having different languages and different customs.
Her all-encompassing power affected everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that financial support to the church was especially for this purpose.
The main authority in the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this centralization of power and money made many doubt whether this principle was followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to blockade the sea route to Germany.
The art of war was effective and cut off important supplies to the army and citizens, although this blockade publicly violated internationally recognized law, which was based on several international treaties from the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering sensitive sea areas, which also put neutral ships at risk.
Because little was said about this military strategy, Germany expected a similar response regarding its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, it was common for most citizens and countries to have a peace and isolationist ideology.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, countries did not wish to find themselves in such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to take a job at Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the USA, he only had 4 cents, a poetry book, and a reference letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a distinct way of describing various periods; each era in China or each ruling family was characterized as a unique dynasty.
Between each imperial dynasty, there was also an unstable time with discord between the regions. The most known was the period with three kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods, there were terrible wars between nobles who fought over the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, where thousands of people died while fighting for the highest position in the great city of Xi’an.
There are many social and political influences, for example, the use of the metric system, the transition from absolute monarchy to republic, the sense of nationality, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, which gave the most progressive and successful ones the opportunity to advance.
The same applied to the military, because instead of basing ranks in the army on class, they were now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people in the working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was very interested in matters that did not concern earthly life. He often came to a cave, which came to be called "Hira," in the mountain "Noor" (light) to meditate deeply.
The cave itself, which has survived the weather and wind, provides a vivid image of Muhammad's religious character.
The cave is at the top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
Even if one knows it exists, it can be difficult to find it. Once inside the cave, one is completely isolated.
Nothing is seen, except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Little of this world is seen and heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that has not been dismantled today.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the third century BC, and it is one of many large pyramids that were constructed to honor deceased pharaohs.
On the Giza plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, lie several pyramids (the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and other family members.
The "arc up" symbol resembles a V and the "arc down symbol" resembles a paperclip or a rectangle without the bottom line.
Up means that you start with the tip and push the bow, and down means that you start with the bowstring (where the hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
An upward bow often creates a softer sound, while a downward bow is stronger and firmer.
Please feel free to write your own marks, but remember that the notes written there are for musical reasons, so they should be followed.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a group of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd, shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have their windows in the carriage wide open.
Once, someone in the crowd waved the head of a royal guard, killed in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses for the American imperialist policy in the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial power to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest from bonds, which were issued in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the excess profits from the extended utilization of the Filipino people would be the fundamental benefits of the American colonial empire.
To understand the temples, one must first understand the context that led to the formation of the layer.
The century during which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages were the Early Middle Ages, and afterwards came the Late Middle Ages, which according to old tradition ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a discourse that encompasses a range of ideas in experiences from technocentrism or the need for technology to a clear sense that human fate is tied to an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their phenomena in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two common perceptions: that the development of technology in itself follows a path mostly beyond cultural and political influence, and on the other hand, that technology has "influence" on societies, which is inherent, rather than linked to society.
For example, one could perhaps say that the car necessarily entails road construction.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Owning a large number of cars also leads to a higher frequency of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technology within healthcare to improve physical injury.
Romanticism had a strong flavor of cultural determinism, taken from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In a romantic context, the landscape shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture associated with the land emerged, and those who were in communion with the place of the community were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known for being the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered to be the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
He is renowned for being a center of luxury from around 400 AD until about 1100 AD.
His dignity declined in the 12th century, particularly because the crusaders had returned home with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was around the time that the title Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th - 11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothes were greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
But due to slow communication channels, the styles in the west could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments then, caused by the Crusades, was that people started to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is done to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds that originate in the ecosystem, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods, which increase the yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
The ceremonies bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Cultures may be distinctive due to the members' age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often display their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, behavior, and expression.
One of the most common approaches to describe the importance of socialization is to use the few unfortunate examples of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Such children are called "unruly" or wild. Some unruly children have been isolated by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this neglect of the child was because the parents dismissed a serious weakening of the child's mind or body.
Unruly children may have been subjected to serious child abuse or psychological traumas before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are, apparently, raised by animals; and it is said that some have lived alone in nature.
When it is raised by non-human animals, the behavior of the feral child (within physical limitations) is almost completely identical to that of the respective caregiving animal, for instance, the fear or indifference towards humans.
Even though education based on projects was supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the platform takes it a step further.
A scaffold is not a way to learn, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are embarking on a new attempt to learn something, such as using a new computer program or undertaking a new project.
Scaffolds can be both metaphorical and real, so, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is too.
Instructive scaffolds are integrated into the software and are there to pose questions, remind, and explain procedures that might have been difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children go into foster care for various reasons, from neglect to abuse and even to oppression.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and nurturing, but they do.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe area for these children.
Our foster system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care must provide everything necessary that was lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet blends parts of both mass communication and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to several layers when it comes to usage and satisfaction.
For example, "to learn" and "to communicate" are considered important reasons to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "current connections" were also identified as new contributing aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined how readers were influenced by websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks showed in his essay, The President's Speech, that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still correctly assess insincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior might also exist in animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups with genetic deviation: hidden and obvious.
A mutation creates a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the population with a significant variation.
Separation and recombination of new blends cause variations back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
Out on the grassland, it is difficult for primates, with a digestive system similar to humans, to satisfy their need for amino acids with the available plant resources.
Furthermore, it has serious consequences if it does not succeed: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources most accessible would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are processed.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but it also provides large quantities of protein, which contains all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a manner somewhat similar to what chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is a procedure where you deliberately wake up during your usual sleep period and fall back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
This is easy to do by using a relatively quiet alarm to come to you without waking you completely.
If you reset the alarm in your sleep, it can be placed at the other end of the room to force you out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, based on the biorhythm, can be to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace in a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in the body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present. Each person has the possibility to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can access information. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many practices from Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is composed of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The cornerstone of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualizations of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras become active, and the consciousness of enlightenment is established.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which resulted in the cooperation between the USSR and the USA. When the war was over, systems, processes, and cultures clashed, which caused the countries to become uncertain.
Two years after the war, the allies were now foes, and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and involve fighting with proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.

These plans became useless after almost just one day when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army arrived and set up Belarusian and Ukrainian defenses after it had invaded the eastern region of Poland, which was in conflict with the Riga Peace Treaty, and the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pacts, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transport is definitely the best way to move large quantities of people and goods by sea.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country can continue to move people and goods, while preventing enemies from moving their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable new examples of this was the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, mostly using submarines, tried to hinder this traffic.
If the allied had failed, Germany would probably have managed to conquer Britain, because it had already conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats have been domesticated animals in the Zagros Mountains in Iran for about 10,000 years.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them to have access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Goat herders, who were often children or youths and who resemble the better-known shepherd, often tended the domestic goats, which usually roamed in groups on hills or other pastures. These methods of herding are still used today.
Already in the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although the tracks were only made of wooden planks that ran parallel to each other, they helped the horses pulling them to move faster and carry larger loads than they could on the rather uneven roads that existed at the time.
The railways were put into use fairly early to keep the tracks in one place. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks would have worked better if they had an iron band on top.
This became common practice, but the iron wore out the wooden wheels on the wagons more.
As time went on, iron wheels were used instead of wooden wheels. In 1767, the first tracks made of pure iron appeared.
The first known way to travel was to walk; humans started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (which means upright man) came into being.
The ancestors, australopithecus, did not walk consistently upright.
Bipedal species are found in 4.2–3.9 million-year-old fossil records from Australopithecus, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to, to a certain extent, prevent future suffering.
This is often like treating symptoms of a disease. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, we must also find the root of the problems and stop them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to human scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of people.
After the congress had approved it on July 4, a handwritten draft, which John Hancock, chairman of the congress, and Charles Thomson, secretary, had signed, was sent a few streets from here to John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed overnight, which are now referred to as the "Dunlap broadsides."
John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time on July 8th in the yard at Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he had read to his units in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest manuscripts of the document we know of that still exist. The originally handwritten document no longer exists.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still resemble dinosaurs in several ways.
They have feet with rough scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers today are based on processed information, which is programmed in a binary system.
A binary digit can only be one of two numbers, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning is perhaps not immediately noticeable. Some symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that it is not possible to determine the cause right away.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicine or toxic household substances nearby.
Check if the label provides direct instructions for first aid for the specific type of poison.
The term "louse" is used by entomologists in common language for this group of small insects.
This expression comes from old knowledge about bedbugs, which are small insects that are remarkably adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs nest, they are adapted to live in the nests or homes of their host.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of disseminated sclerosis (DS), making it the largest neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to get DS compared to men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their or the child's best interest to raise a child.
These parents might choose to give their child up for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents relinquish their parental rights so the other couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is, through scientific methods, to figure out how the world works. This method is used in most scientific studies.
It is not only with experiments, where an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more hypothetical propositions, but also by posing questions, observing, and conducting scientific investigations.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical writings and, particularly, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's thoughts on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the Greek philosophical and scientific roots of the Western world disappeared.
Many observed that the principles in psychology and behavior were often utterly dependent on the presence of internal circuits and their production through the biological clock.
It is established that most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have regular patterns that do not just arise from regular external cues.
Circadian clocks are oscillators that maintain themselves and continue with an independent cycle for a time, even though there are no external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading indications that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments where they either labeled the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects, depending on the type of mutation, how crucial the affected genetic trait is, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
There are only mutations in the sex cells that children can inherit, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting protected areas, and reading information about the ecosystem.
An example is to travel to Borneo and take pictures of and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people from small villages drive their cars to their workplace and pass by others who are going to the place where the former came from, because their workplace is there.
In this lively transportation network, everyone is somehow interconnected and supports a traffic system based on personal cars.
Science now shows that this intense carbon economy has disrupted the stable foundation of the biosphere, which has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developing countries, you rarely hear complaints of a similar level about water quality or about bridges collapsing.
Why do traffic systems lead to so many complaints, and why do they fail almost daily? Are engineers dealing with traffic just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental at play?
Traffic Flow is research into the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations, and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study how well the traffic flows because it is not possible to know with one hundred percent certainty how a driver will behave.
Fortunately, most drivers have a behavior that falls within a reasonably reliable range; therefore, traffic is often quite uniform and can to some extent be described mathematically.
To better describe how smoothly traffic flows, three special characteristics are defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions help in planning, designing, and operating transportation facilities.
Small insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape predators and to find food and mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings alongside their body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, jewel beetles and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings together.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was in orbit around the sun.
Some believed it to be correct, but many thought the opposite; that the solar system was in orbit around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems sensible, because it doesn’t feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times as much water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, in some places it is six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from all the rivers on the planet and into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main river in the Amazon is 6,387 km long. Water from several thousand small rivers flows into it.
Although pyramid construction from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no pyramids were larger or more technically outstanding in their construction than the pyramids of Giza.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the antiquities from their predecessors, which by then were more than a thousand years old.
There are about 800 inhabitants in Vatican City. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and it is the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian to communicate regarding legislation and official matters.
Most of those who work in the state also speak Italian in everyday life, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements, e.g., gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they all are found in nature in their original state and are relatively easy to extract with simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory that everything is made from a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same sequence): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also proposed a theory that they transformed into other substances to create what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements, such as calcium and potassium, are considered to be metals. Naturally, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Some alloys contain small amounts of elements that are not metals, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of elements. All elements are made up of tiny particles, which are called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that several billion of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a welcome convenience for many when it appeared.
As new ways of writing have emerged, the pencil has declined to a lower rank and to less important purposes.
People who write messages on a computer screen never have to so much as look at a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will be like when something new emerges.
Fission bombs operate on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again will release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to fall apart if they are just slightly influenced or not influenced at all.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick closest and 100 km thick farthest away.
She is thinner under the lunar heads and the highlands.
Perhaps there are more moonquakes occurring nearby because the crust is thinner. It was easier for molten rock to surface through the outer layer.
The theory of satisfaction focuses on finding out what forms the basis of who people are or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are inherent as they mature.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they desire, and what things in their environment cause them to behave in a certain way.
Two common theories are Maslow's theory on the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can result from leaders beginning to have authority over some who were previously equal. In a range of possibilities, one still tries to “fit in” as an equal.
This type of leader is poor at making unpopular decisions, correcting others, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable for anything.
In the outer realm of possibilities, one is transformed into a complete stranger, who feels compelled to change everything the team has done and do it themselves.
After all, the leader is responsible for whether the team succeeds or not.
This behavior often results from a disagreement between the leader and the rest of the team.
Task teams should have the same quality as regular teams, but there is a bit of a difference.
Members of a focus group often represent their group locally.
They often have more flexible teams than regular team members, because their team might need to meet in such a way that it accommodates multiple time zones, which the local management might not understand.
Having a true "invisible team" in place (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a different part of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" is the leading team, where each member reports on all matters. The invisible team sets rules for each member.
Why would an organization undertake a time-consuming process to lay the foundation for a learning organization? Development is an objective by promoting education within the organization.
When all available resources are actively used across the departments in the organization, creative abilities and ingenuity can thrive.
The result is that as an organization collaborates to overcome an obstacle, it can bring with it new innovative procedures that benefit the customers.
For an organization to be innovative, the management must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge exchange and education within the organization.
Angel (2006) explains that Continuity is a method designed to help organizations achieve more.
Neurological information provides concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to studying perception. Therefore, the research field becomes smaller and much more precise.
The relationship between brain disease and behavior supports scientists and their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, mental shock, lesions, and growths affect behavior and alter various functions in the head.
New technology helps us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that can help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong significance for future literature, artificial intelligence is an important field in computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in computer science includes making machines automatically solve tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples are managing, planning, the ability to respond to analysis and inquiries from clients, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
Such has become subjects in themselves, which focus on solving everyday problems.
The computer science system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is often built into various home computers and application software for computer games.
Excursions are an important part of every class. Teachers often like to take their students on a trip to visit places that a bus ride cannot reach.
Technology provides the opportunity for virtual field trips. Students can look at museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while they are sitting in the classroom.
Going on a trip together is also a good way to reflect on a journey and share your experiences with classes in the future.
For instance, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state's capital, each year the website is created, but old versions are still available online, like a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students to write better. Although students who write blogs often have poor grammar and spell badly in the beginning, this often changes when there are readers present.
Because students are often among the most critical readers, the one who writes the blog will try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging “forces the student to understand the world better.” The need to satisfy the interest of the readership inspires students to be more perceptive and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging also encourages collaboration, and students extend their learning beyond the regular school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can make students capable of being more analytical and critical; by participating in discussions online, students can explain their position regarding what others write, as well as clarify their own opinions on specific subjects (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada, offering a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Niagara Falls is further south, and to the north is the untouched, natural, beautiful landscape of Muskoka and beyond.
All this and more sheds light on Ontario, as what outsiders consider to be the Canadian core.
Few people live in the larger areas further to the north, and in some places, there is almost uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean on the eastern side of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and can be considered a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations or territories of France, and are known as luxury resort destinations.
The Arabs brought Islam with them to the countries, and it really gained a foothold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all traveling women say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It helps to have a ring on the finger (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they might perceive as nuisances. It is not uncommon to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be determined when you say no to men, and do not be afraid to stand firm in your decisions (cultural difference or not, it is not alright!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but left the city uninhabited after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the city got the name Casablanca from Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional products from Morocco, such as carpets, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and all kinds of trinkets, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a city of travelers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo all the way out east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the streets in the city, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, every visit outside of Goma should be thoroughly examined beforehand to understand why the conflict continues in the North Kivu region.
The city is also a base for those going up to the Nyiragongo volcano, and it is possible to purchase some of the cheapest trips to see mountain gorillas in Africa there.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Along with being relatively inaccessible, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for distant and foreign countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a struggling city, despite the reputation making it a tourist destination and having an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat against the desert.
It was one of the major stops in the PBS special by Henry Louis Gates: Wonders of the African World.
Compared to the other cities in the country, it has a distinctly Arabic rather than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located on the northeastern side of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique on the eastern side, Zimbabwe on the northern side, and on the southern side, the border is the Crocodile River.
The protected area covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different environmental zones, each supporting various wildlife.
It is one of the main tourist destinations in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all other protected areas in South Africa, an entrance and conservation fee is charged for the areas.
It can also pay off to buy a so-called Wild Card, which provides access to some of the protected areas in South Africa or to all the protected areas.
The island of Hong Kong lends its name to the entire Hong Kong area and is the place that many tourists consider the main destination.
The row of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyscraper skyline is compared to a glistening silhouette that reflects in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, it is necessary to leave the island and move to the Kowloon waterfront, which lies opposite.
A large part of the urban development of Hong Kong is densely packed on reclaimed land on the northern coastline.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own. So if you are looking for evidence of the colonial history of the area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest region in the world, extending 80 km inland from the coast into the wilderness of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located within the Indian border is called the Sundarbans protected area.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the renowned forests that covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from cross-country bus stations (across the river) throughout the day, although most of those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the cross-border buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase the ticket a few days before departure.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are good and strongly built.
Shared taxis are a quick and good way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, the bridge is 378 meters long and it has two lanes, which are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction began in August 2011, and traffic was not allowed through until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be finally put into use in September 2017, when the customs stations in Brazil will be completed.
The Guaraní people were the most important indigenous group in what is now the eastern part of Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, who also used the land for planting.
The Chaco region had other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "The gigantic region in the West Indies," was founded as a result of the Spanish conquest of indigenous tribes.
The Spaniards began the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has preserved much of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and the best polo players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year is in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller competitions and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about competitions and information on where tickets for polo matches can be obtained, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency in the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is set to be the same as a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, they may not accept credit cards even though they do accept British and American cash; ask the owners first to find out how you can pay.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so remember to exchange the money before you leave the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, it is not uncommon for the temperatures to be around +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: it usually does not freeze, but the wind and moisture in the air together make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "wet" or "dry" season here: the amount of rainfall is about the same all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
According to local authorities, remain at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how gentle they may seem, bisons, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get injured because they did not keep a suitable distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so leave them in peace.
Be furthermore aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid having or making fragrant food and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and the population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious anchor strike in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to sail out of the harbor.
All the ships, except for a British cruiser, were sunk. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, coordinated by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland spans two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches, where it is safe to swim, and most all have shade from pohotukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the nice suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the middle of Auckland.
These are occasionally crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main beer at the place is 'Number One', it's not a complicated beer, but it is good and refreshing. The other beers at the place are called "Manta".
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel better.
The tap water in the area is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso', cappuccino comes with a heap of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Cocoa lives up to Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many times a rift occurs throughout the year and injuries due to this on the rift are rare.
Take advice from authorities, observe all signs, and listen to safety warnings.
Whale blowholes are near the shores and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be seen outside of these times.
Sharks are there, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; they primarily inhabit river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides the traveler peace of mind, knowing that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but despite that, it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package tours that include breakfast, travel expenses to and from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., entry permit).
Any change or request should, however, be made through the travel agency first and not directly with the hotel.
For some celebrations, the majority of participants choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be really close to the events, then you have to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages is finished, there may be parts of the event that continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you travel across the Nordic Baltic countries in the winter, check where the hut is, because going through ice is quite noisy for those who are most affected.
Time in the city is included in St. Petersburg trips. Tourists with a cruise ship are exempt from having a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos are known for making many attempts to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers with food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and staying at the venue.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks at the bar. But intoxication worsens judgment, and all good players know that it is important to stay sober.
Anyone who travels at high latitudes through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On slippery and snow-covered roads, the friction resistance is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to become stuck.
Visibility can also be impaired by snow blizzards, dust storms, condensation, or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, such conditions with ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic continues, for the most part, steadily throughout the year.
Safari trips are perhaps what attract the most tourists to Africa, and they are the highlight for many visitors.
The phrase safari in more widespread use refers to traveling overland to see captivating African wildlife, especially on grasslands.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come very close to cars, and regular equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you see them better with binoculars.
A hiking trip (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or going "on foot") involves walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020, before the postponement was announced, you may be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation insurances vary, but from late March most cancellation insurances are not valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, and the most common price is around ¥7000.
Ironing clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and board available to borrow, even if one is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you don't feel like wearing freshly ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful that clothes do not become too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in severe cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some make a difference against specific threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
Filters have varying efficiency, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful creatures that they are not accustomed to in their own environment.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in a worst-case scenario lead to allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases by themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force, are usually not defined as plagues.
Buying duty-free gives you the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from tax liability in certain situations.
Tourists who travel to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on goods such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, where one regularly passes through remote woodland.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, then keep a cool head: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp turns are completely normal.
The maximum speeds are significantly lower than in sections before and after — usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
As strange as it sounds, the mobile phone connection is much better here than in many other parts of the journey, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good and in Bavaria, they are undoubtedly heavy and varied, of the same kind as those of the neighbors to the south, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples baked into cakes year round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts from trees. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but heavy cakes, try what, depending on the region, is called Berlin Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry dish is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on how much moisture it contains.
In regions inside Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes; in Southern India and in some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that includes many different types of cooking from regions around the nation.
But if it is used without reservation, the term most likely refers to the food, which originally is from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Cooking from Java, which is now widely available in the archipelago, includes a variety of simple, spicy dishes where Javanese main flavors are peanuts, chili pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports to place the feet in when riding, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but can have safety issues since the rider's feet might possibly get stuck.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but has a foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged behind if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, there are several safety measures to consider.
One thing is that most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a flatter and rather narrow sole.
Another thing is that some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that cause the leather on a stirrup to come off the saddle if it is pulled backward by a rider who is falling.
Cochamó Valley - the foremost climbing destination in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with a wide selection of large granite walls and cliffs.
Some of the peaks offer captivating views. Climbers from all over the world continue to create new routes among the endless possibilities of the walls.
Skiing sports, which involve going downhill, including ski racing and snowboarding, are popular sports where one moves down the snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard under the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski travelers," who prepare entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old — cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 BC.
Skiing downhill as a sport dates back to the 17th century at least, and in 1861, the first ski club for leisure was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also referred to as cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski excursions.
It resembles it, but usually encompasses neither skiing trips in the Alps nor mountain climbing, the latter takes place in steep terrain and requires tougher skis and boots.
Think of the ski trails as similar routes to hiking trails.
In good conditions, you can travel much farther than when you are walking – but it is rare that you reach the speed on skis, as in cross-country skiing over long distances without a heavy backpack on smooth trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, when traveling through several countries, one should fill out several visa applications and go through multiple passport controls.
The Schengen area works, in a way, somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you are in this area, you can usually travel across the borders without going through a passport control station again.
In the same way, if you have a Schengen entry permit, it is not necessary to apply for an entry permit in each individual Schengen country separately, and therefore you save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no official regulation that defines which manufactured items are antiquities. Some tax offices classify items that are older than 100 years as antiquities.
The regulation has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America and Europe.
Handcrafted products can be classified as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important occupation for the Sámi, and the culture in this profession is also significant for many with other occupations.
But even traditionally, not all Sámi have been involved in extensive reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, and the like, and mostly had reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Even though it is widely used, especially among people who are not Romani, the word "Gypsy" is considered to be offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes a travel advisory target, then your health insurance or trip cancellation might be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments that are not your own, but their advice is made for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in different situations than Europeans and Arabs.
Instructions are just a short summary of the political situation in a country.
The viewpoints are often loosely presented, common, and overly simplistic compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the term for all hazardous weather phenomena that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or fatalities.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types, depending on geography, regional studies, and atmospheric conditions.
Sharp winds, hail, unusually heavy precipitation, and wildfires are types of severe weather, and so are thunderstorms, hurricanes, and tornadoes.
Local and seasonal phenomena of severe weather include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the dangers of severe weather in their areas, as these can affect travel plans.
Everyone who plans to visit a country that may be seen as a war zone should receive specialized training.
A search on the internet for 'Hostile Environment Course' will likely yield a local company's address.
A course usually includes detailed information about all the issues discussed here, typically with practical experiences.
A course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role play, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but publications about war zones are few in number.
Tourists, who are preparing for gender reassignment surgeries abroad, must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments is variable in regard to issuing passports without a gender (X) or documents that are updated to match a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to approve these documents is equally variable.
Investigations in security checks have also become much more intrusive in the time after September 11, 2001.
Non-binary people before surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity unscathed.
There are rip currents from the waves hitting the shore, often in a channel or similar.
Due to geographical studies under the sea, the returning current is concentrated in a few, deep parts, and a swift current in deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of the effort to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the current, it is no more difficult than usual to swim again.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be caught again, or, depending on your virtues and whether someone has taken notice of you, you can wait for rescue.
The reverse culture shock comes faster than the cultural shock (there is no honeymoon feeling), takes longer, and can be harsher.
Tourists who found it easy to adapt to new cultures sometimes had difficulty readjusting to their original culture.
Having returned home after being abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and let go of habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were undoubtedly patient and kind, because they knew that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People might not expect that patience and reason are also necessary for travelers to be able to get home.
The Pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You see the pyramids in the darkness and you see them in the peace before the show begins.
The sound of tourists and vendors is usually always heard. The story of the sound and the light is just like a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
The images are displayed on the pyramids, and light is cast on the various pyramids.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have most of the bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The island group lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the filled caldera of an active volcano creates a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area south of the peninsula, which is marked by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains with the peninsula merge with the plateau, and then reemerge to form the 360 km long range of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in the South Pole, Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without phone connection, a satellite phone might be your only solution.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, because it is necessary to be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is often used at sea, also on leisure boats, and on those research expeditions that need data and voice in a remote location.
Your local telephone provider should have been able to provide you with information on how to access this service.
A better and better regarded opportunity for those who intend to take a year off to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who have finished school because it allows them to take a year off without affecting their education.
In many cases, a course taken during this gap year can improve the opportunity to transition to higher education in your home country.
Usually, there is a tuition fee to participate in these educational courses.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
Between the islands and on the lakes, it is not certain that you need a pleasure boat.
Although the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are big enough for recreational boats, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every 7 or 8 people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are no different in this respect, but it is otherwise quite unique (for example, the number is called one to 40 in the Netherlands).
Most Baltic tours with the cruise ship offer a long stop in Saint Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days, even though you return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore during cruise tours, you do not need a special visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises with the cruise ship include Berlin in Germany as part of the itinerary. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a terrifying event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from something that you personally fear or dislike, which many other people also have.
For some, it can help to understand something about how an airplane works and what happens on a flight, in order to overcome this fear of the unknown or of not being able to control what happens.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is crucial with work documents, commercial goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, this is a problem.
If things are sent by air freight, it may take a few days to get them through customs on some routes.
The only way to get it faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come into the picture.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large sum of money for these privileges (or even better to have your workplace do it for you).
This is nevertheless not cheap: a rule of thumb says that you can expect to pay up to four times the usual price for business class and 11 times for first class!
Usually, it does not pay to look for offers on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that a certain core group of travelers is willing to pay the highest price for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and easily, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The language spoken locally is Romanian, but Russian is used extensively.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been affected by civil conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any other member country of the United Nations.
An economic relationship has been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, despite unsuccessful political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good hub for transportation.
Once there was the ancient city, Smyrna, now it is a modern, cultured, and bustling commercial center, located by a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, the buildings with glass fronts, and the modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red tiled roofs, as well as the market from the 18th century and old mosques and churches, although the city has an ambiance of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldórsvík has a view of the nearby island, Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble statues of doves on some gravestones.
It is worth the half hour it takes to walk around the charming village.
Easily accessible to the north is the romantic and enchanting town of Sintra, which became known among foreigners for the many splendors that Lord Byron immortalized in writing.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
North of here you can also visit the large Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a place with a world-renowned Marian statue.
Kindly remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a place of immense significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and many women alive who survived their time here, and even more whose loved ones were murdered or worked to their deaths there, Jews as well as others.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by marking or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, since it has been made the first official language by law.
But Spanish is also used a lot in public transport and other places.
Regular announcements in the subway line are only in Catalan, but disruptions, which are not according to plan, are reported by an automated system in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are reputed to be self-satisfied, unfriendly, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate idea, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave well and conduct oneself as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-brought-up). It makes it considerably easier to get by.
The Parisian charm disappears quickly if you show polite behavior.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with forests, primarily beech, spruce, and fir trees, and the vegetation is a blend of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
He has an exceptionally wide variety of plant communities, due to the range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
This area is also home to a great many species of animals and birds.
Rare wildlife, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, alongside many more common species.
It is required that women, when they visit monasteries, wear skirts that go below the knees, and that the shoulders are also covered.
Most monasteries provide unprepared women with shawls, but if you have your own, especially if it has light colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, it is required that men wear trousers that go below the knees.
This is also available in the storage by the entrance, but clothes are not washed between each user, so maybe you don't feel comfortable wearing these shirts. The same size for all men!
Cooking in Mallorca, like in other Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used all the time.
A simple, popular meal, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any seasoning available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns besides the word Sie for you start with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between certain verbs and effects.
It can also make it easier to read, but writing it is rather complicated, because it is necessary to know whether a verb or adjective is used in the form of a noun.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to keep an eye on are c and g, because the pronunciation changes depending on what vowel follows.
Also make sure that you pronounce r differently from rr: caro means good, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, it will help you to read this beginner's book on grammar to learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand idioms.
If you know a Romance language, it is of course easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who know a bit of Spanish might quickly decide that Portuguese is similar enough that it's not necessary to study them separately.
Astronomical observatories from pre-modern times are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution in its heyday was not as big a problem as it is today, they are usually in cities or on school grounds, and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern astronomical telescopes for research are incredibly large facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry trees bloom, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where peonies were the special interest.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor, only for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the empire.
Plants look best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally organized garden, you will also, without argument, be shown away for collecting "specimens".
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be and it is easy to find your way around, and almost everything is available for purchase when you arrive.
But when one is placed in a "high heat zone" just a few degrees north of the equator, it is necessary to deal with both heat (always) and stronger sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement, Kiryat Arba.
Roads inland can be a good topic to consider for a vacation.
For example, to visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or to sail to interesting cities along the Danube, or to take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also designate routes for popular walks and bike rides.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been widely embraced, including by people who are not believers in Christian countries and by people who are not Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to be up all Easter night at an open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian, theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility custom.
More traditional churches have an Easter vigil on Saturday evening over the Easter weekend, where congregations begin to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus when the clock strikes twelve.
All animals that originally came to the islands arrived either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals couldn't make the journey, and the giant tortoise is the foremost animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since humans came to the Galapagos, several mammals have arrived, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the North Pole or South Pole during winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides an opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is dark almost all day.
Because there are so few people in the areas, light pollution is rarely a problem, and therefore you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
It is common to be in formal attire and for colleagues to refer to each other by last name or job title.
Collaboration at the workplace is crucial, and emphasis is placed on group performance rather than praising individual results.
Workers often must have permission from their supervisors before making a decision, and it is expected that they follow their supervisors' orders without questioning.
