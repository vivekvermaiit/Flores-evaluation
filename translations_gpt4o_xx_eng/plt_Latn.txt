Not only does it simply confirm the long-standing theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides details not found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional measurement.
Experts say that the fur of this animal is brown on the upper side and dark or carrot-colored on the underside.
This discovery also provides more knowledge about the evolution of feathers.
Because the feathers of the dinosaur do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but instead have another form of feather — barb and barbules — researchers concluded that the rachis might have developed later compared to those other forms.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for temperature regulation or attracting mates. Researchers suggested that even though it was a young dinosaur tail, the sample showed mature feathers, not the thin small ones like those of a chick.
The researchers suggested that although it was a young dinosaur's tail, it had mature feathers on it rather than the soft ones like those of a chick.

In France, elections have always been a low-tech affair: the voter isolates themselves in a small booth, inserts a pre-printed ballot paper into an envelope on which they write their chosen candidate.
Once the authorities have verified the voter's information, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.

Candidates can send representatives to witness every step of the process. In the evening, the arrived votes are counted by the volunteers, under strict supervision and following a specific procedure.

Huhne and Pryce are appointed to appear at the Court House on February 16.
Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old, died in the incident. Cuddeback was driving the car.
Edgar Veguilla was injured on his arm and jaw while Kristoffer Schneider needed surgery to reconstruct his face.
Uka's weapon failed when he aimed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider is still in pain, unable to see out of one eye, missing part of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a video link from a USAF base in his country.
Apart from the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed solo in two races within the Championship competition.
Slalom was the first event he participated in, where he received a "Did Not Finish" in his first run. 36 out of the 116 competitors received the same result during the race.
Another race she took part in, the Giant Slalom, earned her the tenth place in the women's group with a time of 4:41.30, which means she was 2:11.60 minutes behind the Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes behind the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who was ninth.
Four female skiers in the women's group did not finish their race, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom did not make it to the leaders in the race.
The computers and mobile phones that were stolen were recovered by the police of Madhya Pradesh.
General DK Arya said, "We have arrested five people involved in the assault of the Swiss woman and have seized their phones and computers."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused will appear prominently in the palace.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver was found to have a serious head injury.
The road was temporarily closed in the area of the accident while rescuers extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
She was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth at first.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge afterwards.
Since then, Adekoya has been charged with killing her son at the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
He was placed in temporary detention pending charges and trial, but any evidence from witnesses might be compromised because his image has already been widely circulated.
This is already a familiar practice in other places in the UK, but the courts in Scotland have a different approach and consider the dissemination of images to be potentially dangerous.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes "it seems that journalists are treading on very dangerous ground when publishing the photos, etc., of those suspected."
The Office of the Crown, which is mostly charged, announced to the journalists that there are no specific statements until the court decision is reached.
The document, according to the leaked information, refers to the border conflict, which Palestine wants to start from the borders prior to the Middle East War in 1967.
Another topic discusses the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to the nations, and the issues in the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests a military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA accepts a presence of five years.
The shooters of the additional tests to combat insects had to be closely monitored by park rangers because the tests were supervised and their effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, skilled volunteers have been deployed, as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) for Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the initial shooting event received comprehensive guidance on safety and conduct.
Martelly took an oath yesterday at the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) which has nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, there was a commission appointed by the president that proposed the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the conditions for the country to move forward with new elections.
The commission is Martelly's response to the widespread opposition to the government that began in October.
Some of the resistance that sometimes involves violence is due to the lack of elections, some of which should have happened in 2011.
There have been around 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, causing six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it knows of 27 incidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of an additional 34 cases of excessive heat, which the company stated are "not dangerous."
The Ministry stated that the delay of the report made by Apple was "truly unfortunate."
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 7:19 in the morning local time (9:19 GMT on Friday).
The emergency office in the Northern Marianas announced that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists in Hong Kong by seizing their tour bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages were freed and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The place of the elderly woman was taken by the photographers because she needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot at that moment.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and worked as a doctor.
She trained to become a female doctor and then worked at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births whenever there was free time.
Research conducted has shown that the lungs of a fetus develop rapidly when supplemented with hormones.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government found two black boxes containing the flight's journey on Wednesday.
The activist friends also honored Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She was also my first trainer. Luna passed away during the night of the second month. She was truly exceptional. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was unique like me... perhaps even surpassed me... I loved her and miss her... she is now in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, there was an 8 percent increase in those opposing Australia's transition to a republic since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey agree with this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be the last on the Australian throne.
At the end of the referendum, it was found that 29 percent of those surveyed thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
She won the gold medal in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming and in the triple relay during the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, questions arose about her training methods.
She could not take the medicine she needed to alleviate her pain because they were banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using equipment and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be thought of as having brought water to Earth and, if organic, able to create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially the formation of Earth, from the collision of a star with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo is 53 years old, he first took his position as governor this year and signed the law allowing same-sex marriage one month ago.
Rumor is what he means by saying "political chatter and nonsense".
It is thought that he will run for president in the year 2016.
The FAA stated that it will help planes take shorter routes and save fuel worth millions, called NextGen, while also reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology from satellites, unlike the old technologies that rely on ground-based radar to help air traffic controllers see planes more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no additional transportation provided, and the overground trains will also not stop at Wembley, with no car stoppage or available parking at the location.
The fear of a lack of transportation has led to the possibility of conducting the game within four walls, not attended by the team's supporters.
A study was published on Thursday in the Journal of Science explaining that a new type of bird is forming on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that it was within just two consecutive generations that the new species evolved, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to the hybridization of the locally exclusive Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortes, and the migrant Cactus ground finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be fashioned into many different shapes. It can be molded into small forms.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be bent or tied. It can be hammered and can also be rolled up like paper.
It can be made slightly thin and placed on top of other metals. It can be made very thin so that it was sometimes used to adorn books containing hand-painted illustrations called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is what is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on whether the chemical substance is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level of the tested chemical product depends on the concentration of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) within it.
A hydrogen ion is a proton from which the electron has been removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
The two dry powders are mixed together, then, with clean and damp hands, they are pressed into balls.
The moisture on your hand will interact with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of substance.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, each house mostly had a water-based toilet, which was connected to a wastewater drainage system and a method.
Remnants of a wastewater drainage system were found in homes in the ancient towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were within public baths, and men and women were together there.
When you call someone a thousand kilometers away from you, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then immediately sends a return signal.
A satellite was launched into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of the light and the way we see things.
A large tool measuring 100 feet is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The existence of the wheel changed the life of the world quickly. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is providing us with a simpler and faster means of transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and various other means of transportation.
Below them, there are still many medium-sized cats that eat prey of medium size ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The niche conversation is the secret to their success, a special task where they have no competition with others.
The lion is the most sociable member of the cat family, they live in large groups called prides.
Pride is made up of one or three grown men, along with as many as thirty women in one box.
Often the females are closely connected, as part of an extended family of sisters and offspring.
The lion, when in a pack, behaves similarly to a group of hyenas or wild dogs, animals which surprisingly have behavior similar to lions (unlike other big cats) in terms of their behavior, and are very effective in taking down their prey.
The tiger is an athlete in every aspect and can climb (even if not very skillfully), swim, jump far, and pull five times stronger than a strong human.
Classified in the same category as lions, leopards, and jaguars, tigers (Genus Panthera) are the only cats that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not the same as the roar of a lion, but rather resembles a sentence with harsh words and a scream.
The Ocelot likes to eat small animals. It catches lemurs, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot preys upon are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that hyenas track and locate prey (game) through scent by sniffing the ground where they have traveled.
They see well in the dark with night vision, and they cannot be heard when they move. The Ocelot hunts its prey by blending in with its surroundings and then pounces on its prey.
When a group of organisms (a small group) leaves its original main group (such as by moving to a mountain, crossing water, or crossing to a new island and unable to easily return), they often change environment, which will not be the same as before.
This new world has many tools and enemies, so the new inhabitants need to find a structure and adapt to become stronger fighters than what was needed before.
The original inhabitants have not changed at all, they still need those divisions just like before.
As time goes by, when the new inhabitants start getting accustomed to their new environment, they begin to become different from other inhabitants.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, these two groups will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this phenomenon evolution, which simply means the creation of a new variety. Evolution is an unavoidable outcome and a very important factor in development.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, when exhaling breath).
Plants make their food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses and our clothes through plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The Tyrannosaurus was the most powerful predator of its time, and for that reason, it feared nothing except other Tyrannosauruses.
Its long jaws adorned with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional row at the top of its mouth, means there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We do not know that, but it might have a forked tongue. Its food consists of turtles, big fish, some sea reptiles, and it might even eat its own kind.
He attacked anything that entered the water, even giant dinosaurs like the T-rex could not withstand it.
Even though most of their food is already familiar to us, the Romans have strange or unusual things to do during celebrations, such as suckling pig, peacock, snails, and a type of rat called dormouse.
Another difference is that if the poor people and the woman ate their meal sitting on a chair, the wealthy men preferred to have a shared meal, which served both as entertainment and an opportunity to dine in their place.
It is unlikely that Roman foods were sourced from Europe, America, or Asia in the later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Romans had tried turkey before.
The Babylonians each built a great temple for their respective god, which was considered the dwelling place of that god.
The people brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctum that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes the towers constructed like pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of a temple.
The top of that tower is a temple dedicated to God.
As for the heat in the Central East, the house is not very important.
Most of the life of Hebrew families takes place outdoors.
The women cooked food in the courtyard; the shop was just a small open table facing the road. The stones were used to build houses.
There were no vast forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants. In Norse history, it is mentioned that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and when he went westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Independent of its sighting, my Eskimo people already lived there at that time.
Even though each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there is a map leading to hidden treasure written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the paper, it is not a map indicating the location of hidden treasure.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776”. This writing is found on the back side of the rotated document.
Even though no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that initially the large document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is very likely that the number was simply augmented.
The arrival on that particular day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was the French in "Vichy" who ruled them. They were French people who allied with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, this attack was known as "Operation Dragoon."
Within just two weeks, the Americans and the French army liberated the southern region of France and turned their attention to Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a group of people who developed by living and working together in a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this also in one aspect defines the size of society.
The city-state is the forerunner of the nation. The culture of civilization is the transmission of knowledge to successive generations, a lasting cultural heritage and dissemination without bias.
The culture of the minority often dies and leaves no solid historical evidence, so it is not recognized as a true civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government - which only included the Congress - governed by the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress does not have the authority to impose taxes, and, since there was no national executive or legislature, it relied on authorities to enforce it, authorities that were not very cooperative.
It also did not have the authority to bypass tax laws and levies within those governments.
The amendment required the consent of all these states, and the central government was significantly undermined by these states, so their representatives often did not show up.
The Italian national football team along with the German national football team are the second best teams in the world, and they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing competitions.
The games held in the winter are the most famous in the Northern region, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island!
There are several small islands in Japan, and that's why it is called a "vondronosy" in geographical terms.
It was in the 15th century that Taiwan began during the time when European sailors passed by, giving the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern region of Taiwan, causing changes in the indigenous methods of crop production and employed Chinese farmers to work in the rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took the western and northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In the year 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which they ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
There are three main structures in Machu Picchu, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the houses at the edge of the compound were rebuilt so that tourists can imagine what their original appearance might have been.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image size worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size around the period of analog film.
It is still being produced today, and moreover, the aspect ratio was inherited by the digital camera aspect ratio.
The type is actually 35mm, it's rather slightly inconvenient because the width is 36mm and the height is 24mm.
The balance of shapes in this dimension (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest even ratio) is thus said to be 3:2.
Many of the familiar formats (such as APS forms for families) are similar or close to this report.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that provides vitality while maintaining order within an image.
It indicates that the most suitable position for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds in width and height (see the example).
During that period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, underwent scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
The global authority it held had an impact on everyone, from kings to ordinary people.
Christians affirm that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and money in the church is specifically for that purpose.
For thousands of years the supreme authority of the church has been in Rome, and the power and money it holds makes one wonder if what it teaches is really true.
Shortly after the conflict began, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy was successful, cutting off the main supply for the military and civilians, even though it violated international law as noted in many international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain concealed bombs in the international waters to avoid obstructing warships entering the ocean area, potentially endangering even ordinary vessels navigating there.
Since the outcome of this strategy was limited, the Germans hoped for the same result as an unlimited time battle at sea.
In the 1920s, the most widespread perspective among citizens and the nation was peace and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and consequences of war during World War I, all nations wish to prevent such circumstances from happening again in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book containing poems, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had special ways to represent different eras; each phase that China or the ruling family went through was distinctively a separate dynasty.
Between the dynasties, there were periods of uncertainty during which the territories were divided. The period of the Three Kingdoms is the most famous of those times, lasting 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During that time, there was a fierce battle among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people lost their lives in battles to claim the highest seat in the great palace of Xian.
The social and political impacts are numerous, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the recognition that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the Liberation Movement, jobs opened up for all job-seeking men, thereby providing opportunities for those who aim farther and are most efficient to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because whereas the army used to be organized according to its class, it will now be organized according to its strength.
The French Revolution inspired many working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this ordinary life. He often went to a cave, which came to be called "Hira," in the "Noor" (light) mountain to reflect.
He hid himself in the cave, which lasted a long time, bringing a clear image concerning Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Dwelling atop the mountain peaks in the north of Lameka, the cave is completely isolated from the world.
The truth is, it is not easy to find at all, even though some have known of its existence. Once inside the cave, it is in complete isolation.
There is nothing else to see except the clear and beautiful sky and the mountains in the surroundings. You cannot see or hear many things from outside while inside the hole.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one still standing among the Seven Wonders.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the massive pyramids made to honor the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and the many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were made to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The "up-bow mark" is like the letter V and the "down-bow mark" is like a small paper clip or a square without the bottom corners.
The top means you should start from the tip and push the bow, while the bottom means you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and then pull the bow.
The sound from the arrow when shot upwards is softer, but its sound is louder when shot downwards.
Feel free to add your own markings in pencil, but remember that the musical purpose is the reason for the existing bow markings, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, who feared disaster, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, who was 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, who was four years old), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on the 6th of October 1789, were forced by a multitude of women from the market to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a cart, surrounded by a group of people shouting and cheering, threatening the King and Queen.
The large crowd urged the King and Queen to open wide the windows of their carriage.
At one point, the severed head of the deceased royal guard was brandished in front of the queen, who was frightened, by someone in the crowd.
Only the people of the Philippines paid the costs of the war waged by American imperialism when they were colonizing them.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a large part of the heavy expenses and the interest from the bonds issued in the name of the Filipino government through the Bank on Wall Street.
It is clear that the substantial profits gained from the exploitation through prolonged use of people from the Philippines were intended to form the basic benefits obtained by American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one must grasp the reality that led to the disruption of the established order.
The time when these events occurred is often referred to by many as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is universally recognized to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term applied to various concepts, from technological push or technological path due to the understanding that the future of humanity is guided by the fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their application through technology.
There are two main ideas shared by most interpretations of what is meant by technological determinism: that technological development itself follows a path that far exceeds the power of culture and politics, and that technology, on the other hand, has "effects" on society that are natural, rather than socially constructed.
For example, someone might say that the car with an engine has led to the development of roads.
However, a national route will not be self-sustaining if only a few vehicles use it, which is why a new manufacturing plan is being launched to reduce the cost of acquiring vehicles.
The public ownership of cars also contributes to the increase in road accidents, which leads to the creation of new medical techniques used to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism played a major role in cultural ideas, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the realm of Romanticism, geography shapes people, and customs and cultures related to that geography emerge; the cultures and customs that align with the community’s setting are better than those laws imposed blindly.
Just as knowing Paris as the capital of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of fashion during feudal Europe.
It was in the year 400 AD that its fame began as a center of great life, and it lasted until around the year 1100 AD.
It lost value during the twelfth century because the Crusaders returned with gifts like silk cloth and perfumes used in food, which were more popular than the goods of the Byzantines.
It was at that time that the title "Capital of Fashion" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic was famous between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the robbery was under the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to these media communication channels, Western fashion styles can be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
It was at the end of the Middle Ages that Western Europe began to develop its fashion. One of the major developments of that time, which resulted from the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons used to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming conducted to produce enough food solely for the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often natural system, using stored seeds and respecting the area with crop rotation or other simple techniques to achieve higher yields.
Looking at history, most farmers cultivate for subsistence, and this is still the reality in many developing countries.
Culture brings together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by society, and it develops them in their own identity.
Small cultures can be distinguished by year, by tribe, class, location, and/or gender.
The quality that defines the uniqueness of a branch of culture includes language, form, religion, politics, gender relations, geography, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often identify themselves through a unique way of life, which includes fashion, rituals, and slang.
One of the ways used to demonstrate the importance of relationships is by reflecting upon those few cases where children, due to neglect, poverty, or intentional abuse, have not interacted with adults during their upbringing.
Those children are called "wanderers" or street children. Some of the wanderer children have been abandoned by people (often their own parents); sometimes, it is the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disabilities that leads to child abandonment.
Cruel children may have experienced severe abuse during their childhood or trauma before their abandonment or escape.
Some, it is said, were raised by animals, and others, it is said, lived alone in the forest.
When a non-human animal is the main one raising them, a feral child exhibits behaviors (limited by the body) almost identical to the animal that cares for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
If project-based learning is meant to facilitate and make learning more interesting, the use of pedagogical tools can go beyond that.
The kombarika is not a method of learning but rather an aid that supports those who are trying new ways of learning, such as using new software or starting new projects.
The binder can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is also a kind of binder, and so is the small paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
The Virtual Raccoons are integrated into the software and are designed to ask questions, evoke, and clarify those paths which might be too difficult for students to master on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Families for various reasons such as neglect, abuse, and even threats.
No child should grow up in a world without love, care, and education, yet many do.
Our view of the Care System is as a protected area for those children.
The family placement system we use should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The childcare facility should provide all necessary things, but the previous place where they were taken in was inadequate.
The Internet connects the elements present in mass communication and communication between individuals.
The characteristics of the internet lead to a higher level when it comes to usage and satisfaction.
For example, “education” and “living together” are proposed as major driving forces in the use of the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Commitment" and "lasting friendship" are also classified as new motivating forms according to Eighmey and McCord (in 1998) when they studied public behavior towards websites.
Due to the existence of photography, it is now possible to identify the subtle facial expressions that appear for a short period of time, less than a second.
And especially, it is said that it is possible to determine if a person is lying by properly observing the smallest expressions of emotion on their face.
In his letter, President's Speech, Oliver Sacks demonstrated that people who cannot comprehend speech due to brain damage can still accurately perceive honesty.
He also suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior might also be possessed by animals, such as pet dogs.
Research from the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic changes: hidden and manifest.
Genetic variation is introduced by mutations, and selection acts on these combinations of variation to either promote or eliminate them.
The difference in categorization and the incorporation of new information alternates between the two generations.
In nutrient-poor regions, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to obtain all the essential amino acids they need solely from the available plants.
Furthermore, there are negative effects of not implementing it: growth disturbances, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The foods from plants that are most easily accessible are the proteins in leaves and vegetables, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, food obtained from animals (insects, ants, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a lot of protein and contains all the amino acids the body needs.
If we really think about it, we should not be surprised if our ancestors satisfied their protein needs in the same way as the apes in the bush.
Sleep interruption is a deliberate awakening process during the usual period that you follow and go back to sleep for a short time afterward (10-60 minutes).
That is easy to do if you use an alarm that is not too loud but just enough to wake you up slightly without fully awakening you.
If you adjust the alarm clock while you are asleep, you can place it far away to force you to get out of bed if you want to turn it off.
These other options following biological changes involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known to hydrate) before sleeping, forcing a person to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the level of tension in their body and mind.
When there are few problems, the positive energy of life is stronger. Everyone can pursue ultimate peace of mind and contentment.
All people can attain enlightenment. The only things that block the path to that goal are our attitudes and our focus on the negative aspects of things.
The Buddhism of Tibet is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is expanded by the path of compassion of the Mahayana and various techniques from Indian Yoga.
The truth is that Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It is Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of love for all.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the spiritual energy of light) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. When envisioning the different deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and awareness of spiritual light is formed.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the confusion of the system, process, and culture led to the collapse of the nation.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were once together became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It should have lasted for the next 40 years, and should have been genuinely fought by the armed forces members from military bases in Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places as well.
The Polish defense had already collapsed on September 17, 1939, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the route of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans could no longer be used shortly after 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian resistance following the attack on the eastern regions of Poland, which opposed the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international agreements, and is shared by both sides and many others as well.
The use of ships to transport goods is currently the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The mission of the navy until now has been to enable your country to transfer its people and possessions, while also interfering with your adversary's ability to move their people and possessions.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the operation during the Second World War in the North Atlantic. The Americans tried to send men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to assist the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which primarily used submarines, tried to stop the movement.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany might have defeated Britain as it did in the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
The ancient culture and tribes preserved it to make it easier to obtain hair, meat, and skin.
The goats being raised were allowed to graze in the open areas or in places where they could feed, often watched over by a goat herder, who is frequently a child or young person, similar to the herding of sheep. This method of animal husbandry is still used today.
The railway was established in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the cart was made of simple wooden planks, the lead horses were able to pull it at a higher speed and carry heavier loads than on the rough roads of that time.
The crossbars were inserted earlier to hold the track in place. However, it was gradually observed that the track would be more successful if there was a layer of metal on top.
It has become a habit, but the iron has caused even more damage to the axles of the train.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first railways were introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, humans began to walk upright at the beginning of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
His ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as is usual.
The specialist in bipedalism can be seen in the remaining bones of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus from earlier, around 7 million years ago, might have also walked on two feet.
We can start living with more respect for the environment, engage in environmental activities, and volunteer to reduce future pain in certain aspects.
It is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want to obtain a temporary solution, we should look for the real root of the people, and we should stop them.
It is undeniable that life has changed due to advances in science and technology, and problems have increased due to the growth in population and the excessively hectic lifestyle of humans.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten copy was signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, and then sent to the nearby printing office of John Dunlap.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, and now they are known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on the eighth of July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, to be read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 prints of Dunlap known to still exist are the only surviving intaglio copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things that birds have in common with dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and nails, lay eggs, and walk on two legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on information processing that turns into binary code.
A binary number can only have one of its two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits, using the terminology of computer science.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general indicators and cannot instantly identify the illness.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of a box of medicine or household chemical products that are poisonous.
Check the notes for specific emergency treatment instructions concerning this particular poison.
The word insect is officially used by researchers about insects for an insect group like this.
This term comes from the ancient relationship with the kongom-pandriana, which is a small animal that easily adapts to fill the gaps of humans.
The ants called soldiers and bedbugs both stay long in their birthplace, adept at living within their nest or the nest of those they attack.
There are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis across the United States, which makes it one of the leading nervous system diseases among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and the optic nerves.
Research has revealed that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to men.
The couple can decide who will raise the child if they do not agree on their own interests or those of their child.
These couples might choose to raise their child.
In child adoption, true parents must relinquish their right to raise the child so that another couple can take care of the child.
The primary goal of science is to explore how the world works through scientific methods. This approach, in fact, guides most scientific research.
However, it is not alone, experimentation and trials are tests used to reject one or several possible hypotheses, scientific research is also driven by the formulation of questions and the conducting of investigations.
The researchers of natural phenomena and philosophy focused on studying classical texts, especially concerning the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's ideas on all scientific topics, including psychology, were accepted.
Due to the decline of Greek knowledge, the West strayed from its Greek philosophical and scientific foundation.
The many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often primarily depend on the existence of internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The recurring orientation, which merely does not respond to external repetitive cues, has been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps on ticking even in the absence of external cues to drive it.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase is one of the reasons why people concluded that DNA is an element found in genes.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either the DNA within the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
There may be a variety of effects from genetic mutations depending on the type of change that occurs, the importance of the affected genetic element, and whether or not the affected cells will form gametes.
Only changes produced by the reproductive cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas changes elsewhere can possibly lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the surroundings, including plants and wildlife.
The types of activities that can be done in the designated area, for example, include hunting, fishing, taking photos, birdwatching, visiting nature reserves, and studying environmental information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, some people leave their town and take a car to go to work, and on the way, they meet people going to work in the places they just left.
In this public transportation vehicle, everyone connects and supports a transportation system based solely on private cars.
Science now says that this large carbon reservoir has removed the biosphere from its relatively constant state, which has sustained human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or collapsing bridges.
Why then does the transportation system cause such complaints, and why are they not efficient every day? Are the transportation engineers really not competent? Or is there something else happening at a fundamental level?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of each individual driver and vehicle between two locations and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to conduct research on traffic because it is not possible to accurately estimate the behavior of drivers one hundred percent.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers usually falls into a pattern; therefore, traffic flow often has a consistent pattern that can be expressed mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic, the three main characteristics have been correlated: (1) flow (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help with the coordination, construction, and exploration of the path.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from predators more quickly and find food and mates faster.
Most flying insects have an advantage because they can fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them several small places to hide from the lurking enemies.
Now, only butterflies and mosquitoes have wings that can be unfolded.
Many centuries ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people think that theirs is true but many believe the opposite; that the solar system rotates around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It's quite concerning because it's not noticeable when the ground moves, isn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and most voluminous river in the world. It carries more than eight times the water, being the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, sometimes six thousand miles wide.
20 percent of the river water on Earth that flows into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River measures 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of small streams.
Even though the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the rule led by kings, the Giza pyramid remains the largest and the best in terms of construction technique.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed by their ancestral monuments, which were already far over a thousand years old.
There are around 800 inhabitants in the city of Vatican. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the fewest inhabitants.
The city of Vatican uses the Italian language in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for those working in the country, while Latin is often used during worship services.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and we can see them in nature in their virgin form and in types that are easy to extract with traditional tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, put forward the theory that everything is a combination of one or more of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
It is like the appearance of four additional elements (in the same order): solid, liquid, air, and plasma, although he also proposed a theory that these change into new elements beyond what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more kinds of metals. Remember that there are many types of elements in the periodic table of chemical elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain an alloy that contains a few elements without iron like carbon.
Everything in the world is made of matter. And all matter is composed of small particles called atoms.
Incredibly small, so much so that a billion of them could fit within the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil is truly a friend to many people when it appears.
It's unfortunate that due to the existence of new writing methods, the importance of wooden pencils has diminished and they are not used as much.
Nowadays, people are just writing messages from the screen alone, no longer needing to be near a mailbox.
We must ask ourselves what the keyboard will become when something new emerges.
The atomic bomb follows the principle that energy is needed for the fusion of its core with many protons and neutrons.
It's like carrying a heavy cart up a hill. The division of an atom's nucleus releases part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart either with minimal or no external force.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called its crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
The area beneath the ocean is thinner, while the area beneath highlands is thicker.
There may be more cracks on the near side because the earth's crust is thinner. It is easier for volcanic fluids to surface in the outer areas.
The content of the theory focuses on understanding what captures people's minds or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people desire what they do, and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
The two famous theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory in everyday life and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Typically, two behaviors can emerge when a manager starts leading their former colleagues. On one hand, there is the tendency to try to remain "one of the friends" (male or female).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, establish disciplinary rules, evaluate work, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the other hand, one becomes an unfamiliar person who feels the need to change everything the team has done and does it for themselves.
Because indeed, it is the leader who is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The quality expected from the virtual team is on par with familiar teams, but there are some small differences.
The members of the virtual team are often used to communicate with the closest physical group.
They often have more independence than regular team members because their teams can meet according to different schedules that may not be possible for local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinctive component that makes up the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is a management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the regulations that each member should follow.
Why would an organization spend time establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of applying the principles of learning within an organization is innovation.
When all the resources within the departments operating within an organization are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity may emerge.
The result is that the collaboration of organizations working to overcome obstacles can lead to new ways of satisfying customers.
Before an organization gains the capability to innovate, leaders must cultivate a culture that loves innovation, and share knowledge and learning within the organization.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher success rates.
The data about mind sciences reveals the theoretical approach in the investigation of knowledge. Therefore, it reduces the scope of research and further validates it.
Helping scientists in their research on the correlation between brain diseases and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect emotions and lead to changes in mental functioning.
The advancement of new technology allows us to observe and study brain structures and functions that have never been seen before.
It brings a lot of knowledge and many tools to us so that we can create experimental models to understand the process.
Although Artificial Intelligence is somewhat related to science fiction, it is a major part of computer science, which studies the behavior, learning methods, and the ability of a machine to adapt its expertise to reality.
In the research of Artificial Intelligence, machines are being developed to automate tasks that require intelligent actions.
For example, management, organization and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer feedback and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and facial features.
It has become a separate discipline that focuses on providing solutions to real-life problems for things like these.
Artificial Intelligence systems are often used nowadays in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, because they are designed within personal computers and many video games.
The field trip is an important subject for all classes. It is often the case that teachers want to take their students to places that aren't part of the regular bus routes.
Technology offers solutions like virtual tours. Students can visit museums, look at aquariums, or admire amazing artwork without leaving the classroom.
Sharing the journey that was made through storytelling is a good way to present the trip and allows experiences to be passed on to future generations.
For example, every year, the students of Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trips to the Capital City, updated annually, but the previous versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogging also improves students' writing skills. Even if students who are new to using blogs do not know grammar and writing techniques, this generally changes due to having followers.
Since students are often the most critical reviewers, the blog author tried to improve the article to avoid such criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to know more about their surroundings." The need to increase people's interest encourages students to be knowledgeable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires communication and encourages students to extend beyond the knowledge of traditional learning.
If blogs are used effectively, they "will enable students to become thoughtful critics, as responding to numerous opinions online necessitates that they can defend their viewpoint even against others' written opinions and articulate their understanding of certain issues." (Oravec, 2002)
Ottawa is the capital of Canada which is very beautiful, people from Canada speak two languages, and it also features art and museums that display both the past and the present.
Further south is where the Niagara Falls are located, and to the north is the location of the natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond, which remains untapped.
All these things and more are what make Ontario stand out to outsiders as the perfect embodiment of Canadian identity.
There are quite a lot of inhabitants in the more open areas further north, and some are almost deserted places without inhabitants.
To provide an example of a population that surprised many people: there are more African Americans living in America than Canadians.
The islands of Eastern Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest so far, and indeed a continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of those small islands are independent countries or have ties with France, and are known as luxurious coastal resorts.
The Arabs brought the Islamic religion, and it had a significant impact in Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route connecting Europe and India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
It is better to say that all women travelers are married, regardless of their category.
Making rings also helps (but not just those expensive ones).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as harassment, and it is common for people to follow them, hold their arm, etc.
Stand firm in refusing a man, and do not be afraid to stand by your views (whether there are cultural differences or not, that doesn't make everything acceptable).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the tenth century before our current era and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, who called it Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, then rebuilt and named Casa Branca by them, but it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city to be Daru l-Badya, and it was the Spanish traders who established the commercial base there and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is the least interesting place to shop in Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as pottery, vases, various fabrics, hookahs, and many types of trinkets, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a major city that attracts tourists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava flow of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the roads in the city, especially in the downtown area.
If Goma itself is peaceful, visiting outside of Goma requires consideration to understand the developments of the ongoing conflict in the northern Kivu region.
This town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano with following mountain gorillas, one of the easiest in Africa.
You can also use boda-boda (motorcycle transport) if going to Goma. The actual fare (on site) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short distance.
With its reputation for being hard to reach, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for any place that is remote or far away.
Now Timbuktu is a poor city, although its fame attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the major steps during the special program Wonders of the African World broadcast by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The place is completely opposite to other cities in the country because it is more Arab-like than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) covers the northeastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Voaibe River on the southern side.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 zones, each sustaining various wildlife.
It is one of the most attractive in South Africa and is classified as the greatest attraction in South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Like all the national parks in South Africa, there is a daily maintenance and entrance fee charged for the reserves.
People may also benefit from purchasing a Wild Card, which allows access to selected reserves in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong area and is regarded by many tourists as the most interesting and attractive place.
The towering buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong have been compared to a drawing of shimmering bars seen through the waters of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to have the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the developments in the city of Hong Kong island are concentrated in the areas with claimants confirming the northern boundary.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, so if you are looking for evidence concerning the past colonization in this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast deep into the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans are reported to be a UNESCO heritage site. The forest section in the Indian region is called the Sundarbans nature reserve.
It is not just sparse trees in the forest – there are remnants of the dense forest that once covered the plains of the Gangetic plains in the past.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², and one-third of it is covered by water/mangroves.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary for various species, with an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer residing there.
There is regular public transportation throughout the day departing from the district station (across the river), even though most of them leave between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang.
Because the vehicles connecting the districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most of those districts are served by the small public transportation vehicle Coaster Zaponey, which is comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis allow for quick and safe travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the town of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers is 83 meters, that is, their length is 378 meters, and there are two roads which each have a width of 3.50 meters.
The height of the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge was scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, once the Brazilian customs stations were completed.
The Guaraní are the largest indigenous group, who lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, as nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced agriculture for subsistence.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In Paraguay in the 16th century, formerly called "The Great Province of India," was born the result of the encounter between Spanish colonizers and indigenous groups.
The Spanish were the ones who started the colonial era which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain many of its native characteristics and identity.
Argentina is a country with one of the most skilled polo teams in the world, and that is what it is best known for.
The biggest competition of the year is held in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller games and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
If you want to get information about the game and know where to buy tickets to watch the polo game, check with the Argentine Association of Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley, across from the FIC West shopping center.
The pound sterling is generally accepted everywhere in the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On those remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency might be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to see which payment methods are accepted.
It is really very difficult to exchange the currency of the Falklands when not on those islands, so it is better to exchange money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is in the southern part of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in humid and hot regions, and during the summer days, temperatures above +30°C are often observed.
Winter may be depressingly cold: it is rare for the temperature to drop very low, but combined with the wind and humidity, it makes it feel colder than what the temperature indicates.
There is no real “rainy” or “dry” season: the amount of rain remains fairly constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, there are still wild animals and none should be fed or disturbed.
According to what the park manager said, stay at least 100 meters away from the bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
Although the appearance of zebu cattle, bears, and most large animals seems gentle, they can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not respect the appropriate distance. These animals are huge, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Moreover, be aware that the scent attracts bears and other wildlife, therefore, avoid bringing or cooking fragrant food and always keep the area clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was built around the year 1850 and became the official capital of Samoa starting in 1959.
The port was a famous place during the naval war of 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave that port.
All the ships sank, except for one British warship. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a non-violent assembly in the town led to the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is between two harbors. The most famous ones are among the three areas.
The beaches on the northern coast (in the district of North Harbour) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend north to Long Bay and south to Devonport.
Almost all of them are on the seaside with sandy beaches and docking is safe, and almost all of them have the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beach is located at the Waitemata Harbour, and in the downtown market of Mission Bay, as well as in St Heliers in central Auckland.
Oftentimes, these are beaches frequently used by large families, which have many shopping areas along the waterfront. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it's not a fancy beer, but it's good and refreshing. The name of the other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines that should be owned, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might be easier to transport.
The tap water on site is safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the "flat white" is a term that comes from abroad. Black coffee is simply "espresso," the cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is in line with the purchasing power of the Belgians. Juice is expensive, but it is very good.
There are many excursions around the reef throughout the year, and accidents related to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek advice from the authorities, respect all signs, and pay special attention to warnings that protect against danger.
The boxed jellyfish are found near the coast and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they are seen outside of these times.
Sharks indeed exist, but it is rare for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will flee.
Sea cucumbers do not survive long in the open ocean; their real habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking provides peace of mind to travelers as they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Tour guides often collaborate with specific hotels, although it may be possible for you to arrange other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a guide.
Tourism operators often offer packages that include breakfast, arrangements for transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and accommodation deals.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain the necessary documents for your destination (such as a visa).
If there are any corrections or requests, they should be directed to the person in charge of the trip, and not immediately approach the hotel.
For some festivals, most of the music festival attendees camp on-site, and most consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the stage, you need to arrive early to secure a spot close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on stage is over, there might be some parts of the party that continue the music until late at night.
Some festivals allocate parking spaces for families with young children.
When crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, it's better to look at the location of the igloos, as crossing ice can create a terrible noise for those who truly experience it.
Included in the Saint Petersburg cruise is a city sightseeing time. The passengers on the cruise do not need to pay for a visa (see the conditions).
Generally, casinos strive hard to significantly increase both the time and money spent by customers in them. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
They often provide food and refreshments to entertain their customers in order to satisfy and please them.
There are some places that offer alcoholic beverages in their homes. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all skilled players know the importance of abstaining.
People planning to go to high places or mountains should expect snowfall and ice there, and it might be very cold.
The traction is reduced when driving on icy and snowy roads, so you cannot drive as if you were on a simple paved road.
During the snowfall, enough snow to immobilize you may fall in a short period.
Visibility may also be limited due to snowfall or sleet, or due to frost or ice on the car windshields.
On the other hand, the extremely cold and icy weather is already familiar in many countries, and generally, traffic flows continuously without interruption throughout the year.
Perhaps the Safari is the most attractive to tourists in Africa, and is also the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari refers to a land journey to observe African wildlife, particularly in the forest.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes often come close to the vehicle, and usual equipment allows you to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
Walking safaris (also known as "field trips," "hiking safaris," or "walking") are hikes that last for several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will run from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in different locations across Japan.
