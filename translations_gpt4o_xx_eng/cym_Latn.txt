Although it appears that one experimental vaccine can reduce Ebola deaths, so far, it has not been clearly shown that any drugs are suitable for treating the current infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies suggested it had less benefit than was sought in terms of preventing death.
In the PALM trial, Zmapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than disaffiliation.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.

The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed shafts, called rachis, but have other feather characteristics - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that rachis is likely to be an evolutionary development later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers and not chick down.
The researchers suggested that, although this was a juvenile dinosaur tail, the sample showed adult feathers and not chick down.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of every star in the system is driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy like some kind of halo, and that it consists of numerous small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "causing great concern and is very alarming because of the very high death rate".
Some patients may have caught the infection in the hospital, according to Dr Moll, and at least two were hospital health workers.
In a year's time, an infected individual can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper showing their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting register.
France's electoral law quite strictly organizes cases.
Since 1998, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that there are no envelopes present at the start of the vote except for those of authorized voters that have been properly accounted for.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, ballots are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, saw her finishing tenth in the women's sitting group race with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the one who finished in first place, Claudia Loesch of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the one who finished ninth, GyÃ¶ngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their runs, and a total of 45 out of 117 skiers failed to be listed in the Giant Slalom.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of those who have been accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Senior police inspector, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car struck it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then charged with murdering her son.
She is in custody until there is a charge and a case, but any eye-witness evidence could be tainted because her image has been published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have viewed the publication of pictures as something that could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes "journalists walk a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of those under suspicion".
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for prosecutions, has suggested to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least the day.
According to the confidential leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Among other topics that are supposedly being addressed are the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the matter of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such presence for only five years.
Archers in the additional pest control trial would be closely supervised by wardens, as the trial is being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage of the Park with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting campaign received safety instructions and comprehensive training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CAP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the government that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were sparked by the failure to hold elections that were supposed to have been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods that overheat have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 24 additional cases of overheating, with the company describing them as "non-serious".
The administration responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle towards the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later the photographers replaced an elderly woman because she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went into a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working in the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone were given, it would speed up the maturation of the baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government researchers discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of a double moon. Quite unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the comment that "Luna is as bizarre as meâ€¦more so perhapsâ€¦I love her and I will miss herâ€¦I hope she is in a better place".
Out of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, eager for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 230m freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his problems, there is doubt about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the drugs needed to overcome his pain as they have been banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several individuals verified the discovery using hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was published on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the source of the water supply to the earth along with organic substances that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his role as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide more detailed information to pilots.
No additional transport is being arranged and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no car parking or park and ride facilities available at the stadium.
Fears arose about the lack of transport and the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's GalÃ¡pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to embellish hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed from them (since Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our view.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to provide much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other transport devices.
Beneath them are cats of a more moderate size that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many kittens (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special role for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride typically consists of one to three adult male lions who are related, along with up to ten to twenty-eight females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related, as a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs (but not like other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around good athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of fierce words being shouted.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. All the animals that ocelots hunt are almost much smaller than themselves.
Scientists think that ocelots track down and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, detecting where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (small population) is separated from the main population it came from (as if it moved over a series of mountains or a river, or if it moved to a new island so that it is not easy to move back) it often finds itself in a different environment than the one it was previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also offer shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Plants are the majority of the foods we eat. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of his time, so he feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long mouth was full of more than 70 very sharp teeth, along with an additional set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that would cross its path.
We do not know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It would also attack anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not match it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of dormouse called a pathew.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the wealthy men liked to have banquets together by reclining on their sides as they ate their meals.
Meals from Ancient Rome could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no grain, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods which was considered the home of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would attempt to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an outer court and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, known as ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The girls were cooking in the yard; open counters were what the shops looked out over the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the lands of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. In the Norwegian sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living in the area at the time.
Although every country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the film National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large vellum document (it measured 29 and three-quarter inches by 24 and a half inches) was rolled for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation was added as a label only.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
They were controlled by "Vichy" France. These were the French who had agreed to peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, the attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just a fortnight, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant large group of people who live together and cooperate as a society.
The word "civilisation" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, belonging to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that somehow defines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a fair dispersion.
Often, small cultures disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central governmentâ€”only with Congress as its componentâ€”under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have any power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on provincial authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
He did not have the authority either to trample on tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states were so dismissive of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The national football team of Italy, as well as the national football team of Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster, a group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical standpoint, as an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, where passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, and this was the leading film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being manufactured today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
36mm wide and 24mm high is the actual 35mm format, which is somewhat confusing.
Thus it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family, for example) are equal to or approximately correspond to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound the countries of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial funds of the church are specifically there for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this accumulation of power and money led many to question whether this belief was being answered.
Shortly after the war began, Britain initiated a blockade against the German navy.
The strategy proved effective, obstructing essential military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law reconstituted by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Given that there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the main attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each period of China or each ruling family was a particular dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of divided states among all the dynasties. The most well-known of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods fierce warfare occurred between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Ancient China's history; thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are a number of social effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people not just to one ruler.
Also, occupations were open to all male applicants after the Revolution, enabling the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same is true of soldiers because rather than having the army ranks based on class, they were now based on the quality of the gun.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working-class people who were oppressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a great interest in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to go to a cave that came to be known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for meditation.
the cave itself, which survived the times, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Lying on the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you're inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the beautiful clear sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of a number of large pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the great pyramid is the largest), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like a V and the "down bow" mark looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
Up means you should start at the front and push the bow, and down means you should start at the handle (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up bow usually creates a softer sound, while a down bow is stronger and more definite.
You are welcome to mark your own scores in pencil, but remember that the phrasing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be treated with respect.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forcibly taken back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on the 6th of October 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a swarm of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to have their carriage windows open full width.
Once a member of the swarm beheaded a royal guard who was killed in front of the Queen who was terrified for her life.
The cost of the United States' imperial war in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial system to pay a large amount of the expenditure and interest on bonds that were being raised in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the exceptional profits derived from the exploitation of Filipino people are synonymous with the fundamental gains of U.S. imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, you must understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the eleventh century, the twelfth century, and the thirteenth century (AD 1000â€“1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from pushing technology or technological imperatives to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
There was a large element of cultural determination in romanticism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time practices and culture arose that belonged to that geography, and these, existing in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws imposed oppressively.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame for being a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because Crusaders returned bringing gifts like silks and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets had to offer.
This is when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, fashions in the west could be up to 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the age as a result of the crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family only.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses saved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other quite simple techniques to ensure the highest possible yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still true in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their membership through the unique and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, practices, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, socialized by adults as they grew.
Such children are called "semi-wild" or wild. Some semi-wild children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the children were abandoned because the parents had rejected the childâ€™s severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma as children before being abandoned or before running away.
It is claimed that others have been raised by animals; it is said that some have lived in the wild on their own.
When a child is entirely raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of the specific animal caring for them, such as their fear or indifference towards human beings.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond that.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather support that aids individuals who are experiencing new learning situations such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, motivate, and explain procedures that might have been challenging for students to manage on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We believe that the Foster Care System is a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system is meant to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were not provided in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
Certain characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as aspects of new motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to determine if an individual is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks suggested how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination move back and forth between two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failing to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and pods, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide many proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors had solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Interrupting sleep is the process of waking up deliberately during your regular sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
It is possible to do this easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which we know is a diuretic) before sleeping, forcing someone to go to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in one's body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present. Every individual has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of complete love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The focal point of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Deity. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are energized, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts in terms of system, process, and culture caused the countries to quarrel.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost overnight replaced when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of navies was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to invade Britain as it did in the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skins.
In general, domestic goats were kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders, who were usually children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon rails consisted of parallel wooden planks only, they enabled horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the period.
Slippers were introduced quite early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first method of travel that we know about, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specializations can be found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should calm them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological developments of humanity, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and humanity's wasteful way of living.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of this document by John Nixon was in the Independence Hall yard on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and it was read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have many features that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have feet with talons and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually every computer in use today is based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, like vomiting, are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
Perhaps the best sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term beetles is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from being long familiar with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin beetles and bedbugs are colorless, adapted to living in the nest or home of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop Multiple Sclerosis as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, nor in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main aim of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, he is not alone, experimenting, which is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible theories, asking questions, and making observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinion was accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As understanding of Greek deteriorated, the West found itself divorced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
A number of rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not solely responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to have a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the earliest suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by either labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transferred to children, but mutations in other places can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking pictures of, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the country in cars to go to their workplaces and they are passed by others who are going to their work destination in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars and supports the system.
By now, science suggests that this enormous carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems provoke such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two places and the interaction they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and implement road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the largest river except one.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide at times.
20 percent of the water flowing out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size or the technical excellence of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. This is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official correspondence.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
People have known about fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as each of these can be found in their native form and they are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made from a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what you see.
Essentially, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of substance. Every substance is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.

Unfortunately, as new methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been downgraded to a lesser status and use.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens, without having to go near a mine.
One can only guess what the keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's quite like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar features on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things that they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do specific things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise when managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performance assessments, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, there is one who turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has been doing and take ownership of it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often they have more autonomy than conventional team members as it is possible that their team meets across different time zones that their local managers may not understand.
There is also a genuine presence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) which is a unique component of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that every member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the laborious process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can become apparent.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as an approach used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Therefore, it limits the field of research and makes it much more detailed.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior assists scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although there is a significance of science fiction to Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnosis and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now being used frequently in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the armed forces, as it has been built into many home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Quite often, a teacher would be delighted to take her students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is an excellent way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, the website is remodeled every year, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer is starting to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their position within the context of other writings as well as outline their own viewpoints on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting, bilingual capital city of Canada and features a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada of yesterday and today.
Further to the south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to the natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond which is untouched.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered completely Canadian by people from the outside.
Large areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost wildernesses with no one living in them.
For a comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took a big place in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonization of Europe began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences might lead to what they would consider as harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, have your arm grabbed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it does not make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in the whole of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of jewelry, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as tracking Mountain Gorillas, which is among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poorer town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special program, Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts completely with other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arab instinct than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square km and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the primary symbol of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South Africa's National Parks, there are conservation and daily entry fees for the Park.
It could also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is often considered by many tourists as the main hub.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour's water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite shores of Kowloon.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast into the heartlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sundarbans National Park is the name of the part of the forest that is within Indian territory.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps however - they contain some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, a third of which is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area now.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses between areas are often full, you are advised to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs check points are expected to be completed.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the GuaycurÃº and PayaguÃ¡, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay was born, previously called "The Giant Province of the Indies", as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, and it lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las CaÃ±itas.
There are also smaller tournaments and games to be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) and its value is the same as the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, across the road from the FIC West shop.
In general, British pounds are accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the remote islands, it is likely that credit cards will not be accepted, although British and United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so you should exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is to the south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30Â°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold; temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain received remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
However tame they may appear, wild oxen, moose, elk, bears, and almost every large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the correct distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so allow them their space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval dispute in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the chief officer Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland occupies two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches on Waitemata Harbour, in the wealthy suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a good range of shops along the promenade. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The name of the other local beer is "Manta".
There are a number of wines from France available, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you are concerned.
For the people of Australia, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino comes loaded high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of those incidents on the reef are rare.
However, you should take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be seen near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally they can be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, however, they attack people rarely. Most sharks are afraid of people and they would swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their main habitat is in river estuaries to the north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that she will have a place to sleep once she reaches her destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They are also able to hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to acquire other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, enquiries about any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those attending music festivals camp on-site, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you will need to get in early to secure a campsite close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages has ended, remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some holidays have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic in the winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as going through a row causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the town. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find exits.
They usually have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment, to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy roads with snow on them, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow to trap you can fall in very little time.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or blowing snow or by vapor or frost on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic usually continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Perhaps safaris are the biggest attraction for tourists in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in general use refers to traveling over land to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, hunting leopards, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
The walking safari (also known as a "wild walk", "hiking safari", or even "trekking") involves hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the summer Olympic games twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic games were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between Â¥ 2,500 and Â¥ 130,000, with regular tickets costing around Â¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if one is not present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if youâ€™re not keen on wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in other areas several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, then you should consider purchasing your water in a bottle sealed by a reputable company.
Travelers might encounter pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause painful itching, or in a worse case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, nor dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently crossing through isolated rural landscape.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limits are notably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the road, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples cooked into pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many baked goods from Germany include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you have a craving for small yet rich pastries, try those known as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Knapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a vast variety of regional foods found throughout the nation.
However, if it is used without additional conditions, the term tends to mean the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available across the archipelago, Javanese cooking style includes a collection of simply-flavored dishes, and the main flavors favored by the Javanese people are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the feet of the rider that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They offer more stability to the rider but can have safety issues because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially those from England, have safety bars that allow the leather stirrup to come off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.

The peaks offer amazing views of the mountain tops. Climbers from all parts of the world are continuously establishing new routes among its endless potential of walls.
Snow sports downhill, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "skiing fanatics," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Skiing downhill as a sport dates back to at least the sixteenth century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not include skiing or alpine mountaineering, the latter on steep terrain requiring much stronger skis and boots.
Think of the ski path as a similar walking path.
In good conditions, you can travel distances considerably greater than walking - but very rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on rough paths.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
The Schengen Area, however, operates somewhat like one country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, generally you can cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each individual Schengen member country, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no general definition for which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Deer husbandry is an important livelihood among the SÃ¡mi and the culture associated with the craft is also important to many with other professions.
Nevertheless, even traditionally, not all SÃ¡mi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, and have mainly kept reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many SÃ¡mi work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important income in SÃ¡pmi, the SÃ¡mi area.
Although it is widely used, especially among those who are not Romani, the word "Gypsies" is considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance could be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory documents are a brief summary of the political situation in just one country.
The viewpoints presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious societal disruption, or loss of human life.
Rough weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive moisture, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
It is likely that an Internet search for "Hostile environment course" will provide a reference to a local company.
A course will typically cover all the topics discussed here in much greater detail, usually including practical experience.
Usually, a course will run from 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about surviving in the wilderness, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning an overseas surgical procedure must ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
Governments' willingness to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is equally varied.
Searches in security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the period following September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
A rip current is the flow that comes back from waves breaking off the beach, often in a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper spots, and a fast current to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and if someone has noticed you, you may want to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock occurs sooner than culture shock (there is a shorter period of new stress), it lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes have an especially difficult time readjusting to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the customs from your home culture.
When you went to a foreign country for the first time, it's likely that people were patient and tolerant, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
It is possible that people do not foresee that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of noise and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest number of stations, with sixteen operational in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 kilometers north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where a submerged active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here join the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, with the highest being Mount Vinson, which is 4892 m.
In remote locations without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as voyages that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular choice for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a year out before going to university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a year-abroad course can enhance your chances of progressing to higher education back in your home country.
There is usually a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On the archipelagos and the lakes you do not necessarily need a sailing boat.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are actually large enough for any sailing boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national leisure activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic Cruises include a long stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of days as well as return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using shipboard excursions, you will not need a separate visa (in 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.

Delivery companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is really important with business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repair.
In some ways, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they had sent things by air freight, on some routes it might have taken days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline's regulations would not allow them to send bags without a traveler, and that's where you become relevant.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it on your behalf).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy price for business, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even searching for discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know well that there is a core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of reaching somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÅŸinÄƒu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
At one time in the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, buildings with glass fronts, and modern shopping centers are speckled with traditional red tile roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more similar to the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some tombs.
It's worth half an hour to take a walk around the interesting village.
To the north and within easy reach is the very romantic and interesting town of Sintra, which was made famous to foreigners after a commendatory report of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The 403 Scotturb Bus travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also, to the north, visit the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous site for apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site that holds almost immeasurable significance to a substantial portion of the world's population.
Many men and women are still alive who survived their time here, and many more had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here, Jews and non-Jews alike.
You should treat the site with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti into structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are displayed in Catalan only because it is established by law as the first official language.
And yet, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made in Catalan only, but unplanned disruptions are announced in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a bad reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an incorrect stereotype, the best way to get ahead in Paris is to be on your best behavior, act like someone who is "bien Ã©levÃ©" (well-bred). It will make moving around considerably easier.
The curt manners of the people of Paris will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and pine trees, and it features a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkable variety of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts over the knees and have something over their shoulders, too.
Most of the monasteries provide cloaks for women who come unprepared, but if you bring one yourself, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed after each user so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The food of Majorca, like foods from similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular meal, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available accompaniments like cheese, tuna, etc.
Every name, alongside the word Sie for you, always begins with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It can also be argued that it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominative form.
Pronunciation is quite easy in Italian because most words are pronounced in exactly the way they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as the way they are pronounced varies depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means vehicle.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and consistent on the whole.
So, reading this grammar book would help you understand a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
It goes without saying, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete by now, and are used as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not a problem at its height as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor would hold the first cherry blossom parties around the Imperial Court only for himself and other members of the nobility.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" is also going to get you thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is an exceptionally safe place to be in general and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But being located in the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with heat (constantly) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
A few buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Verify that the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base your holidays on.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a water trip to interesting cities on the Danube or take a boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define paths for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it celebrates the birthday of Jesus.
Many holiday traditions are also observed by non-believers living in Christian countries and non-Christian people around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in some open place to watch the dawn break.
There are Christian theological explanations for this tradition of course, but it could be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning to celebrate at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, leaving the giant tortoise as the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
As the population of the areas is sparse, and light pollution is therefore not often a problem, you will also be able to see the stars.
The working culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues call each other by their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees must often get their superiors' approval for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
