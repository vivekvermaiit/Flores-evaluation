This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides details that fossils usually do not give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this creature were chestnut brown at the top with a pale carrot color at the bottom.
The discovery also provides some clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of the dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft, called rachis, but they had other characteristics of feathers like barbs and barbules, researchers have thought that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development subsequent to the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but rather for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the fluff of a chick.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was trying to discern might have been caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth causing the tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory says that a large part of dark matter is found around a galaxy like a halo, and is made of many tiny particles.

In France, voting has usually been a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth, put a pre-printed sheet indicating their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the elector puts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting register.

Since 1988, the electoral urns must be transparent so that the voters and observers can see that there are no ballots present at the beginning of the voting and that no ballots are added except those of the voters who are regularly counted and authorized.
The candidates can send representatives to oversee every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision following specific procedures.

The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, no one got hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The street where the accident happened was closed for a while as the rescue teams extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterward, he was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya from that moment has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court accused of having killed her son.
She is in custody awaiting remand and trial, but any testimonial evidence could be compromised because her image has been made so public.
This is something that happens often in the United Kingdom, but justice in Scotland works differently and the courts have found that publishing photos can be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says "the journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photos etc. of the suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for proceedings, told journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the case is referred to trial.
According to the leak of information, the document will refer to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be on the basis of the borders before the Six-Day War of 1967.
It seems that other topics addressed are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees that this presence should only be for five years.
Those who participated in the supplementary pest control test had to be well supervised by the rangers, while the test was monitored, and its effectiveness evaluated.
In association with the NPWS, the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been taken under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the current director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received safety instructions and complete training.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine people.
It's Martelly's fifth GDP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEO as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that started in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, have arisen from the fact that there have been no elections, some of which should have been held since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating iPod malfunctions have been reported, they have caused six fires with four people who have sustained minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan has said that they are aware of 27 incidents connected to the devices.
Last week, METI stated that Apple had been informed of another 34 overheating incidents which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by saying that the delay in Apple's report is "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The emergency office of Northern Mariana Islands said there was no damage in the nation.
The Pacific tsunami warning center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed today along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the seat of an elderly lady who needed the bathroom. Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
Studied as a midwife and started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the Liggins hospital, he started studying premature birth in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua has said that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' from the flight recorders.
The fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. A unique thing just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented saying that “Luna was as crazy as I am...maybe even more...I love her and I miss her...let's hope she's in a better place.”
Of the 1400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, those who do not want Australia to become a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
The Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey agree with this idea and want Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her health was put into question.
He wasn't able to take the medicines to overcome his pain because they are banned by the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the Central Missouri University, on January 25th found the largest known prime number.
Many people have monitored the situation using various tools and programs since early February and it was communicated on Tuesday.
Comets could have brought water to Earth along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth was formed, given that comets hit the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the start of the year and last month he signed a law that legalized same-sex marriage.
Regarding the voices, they said they are "political chatter and nonsense".
They say he will run to be president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly with shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses a satellite technology different from the old ground-based radar technology which allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint planes more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No special transport has been put into operation and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the parking and interchange car parks are not available on-site.
The fears about inadequate transport have raised the possibility that the match might have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science discusses the birth of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
The researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have said that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it is believed that this process lasted much longer, due to the hybridization between the endemic species of Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the migrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be wound and compressed. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and placed on other metals. It can be made so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-made figures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by how many hydrogen ions (the H in pH) are present in the substance being examined.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed (since the hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together and then with clean and wet hands, shape to make a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a toilet in almost every house connected to a complex sewage system.
The remains of sewers have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets also in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of the public bath buildings where men and women went to relieve themselves together.
When someone calls you from so far away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and sends it down almost instantly.
The satellite has been sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts the light and our view.
It takes a rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us has been to give us a more comfortable and faster means of transport.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them, there are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
In the end, there are many small felines (including domestic cats) that eat many smaller animals like insects, mice, catching them and birds.
The secret of its success is the niche concept, a special place that every feline has and that keeps it away from competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines; they live in large groups called prides.
The packs are made up of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other; they are a big family of sisters and daughters.
The prides of lions are somewhat like the packs of wolves or dogs, animals incredibly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and equally deadly for their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not well), swim, make great leaps, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the powerful one of the lion, but more like a sentence of harsh words shouted.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than itself.
Scientists think that the ocelot follows and finds animals to eat (prey) by the scent, detecting where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move silently. The ocelot hunts its prey by camouflaging with the environment and then jumping on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from where they came (such as when they move beyond a mountain or a river, or move to a new island in a way that makes it difficult to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has many resources and many competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they need the same adjustments as before.
In the meantime, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they start to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands and even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means in practice the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and such an important part of evolution.
The plants create oxygen that humans breathe, and they take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (or expel).
Plants are nourished by the sun through photosynthesis. And they also provide shade.
We build houses with plants, and clothes with plants. A large part of what we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaur was the strongest predator of its time, it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
In its mouth, it had more than 70 teeth sharp as blades, and another row was on the palate, there was no escape for anyone who got caught.
We are not sure, but it could be that he had a forked tongue. He ate turtles, fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe he was also a cannibal.
If it caught everything that entered the water; even a beast like a T.rex would have met an ugly end.
Even though many of their foods might seem normal to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual things like wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate seated on chairs, the gentlemen held banquets lying on their sides while eating.
The food of the ancient Romans could not have food that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the centuries afterward.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for all their deities, which was the house of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to attend to the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priest could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the form of a pyramid called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary of the god.
In the mild climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
A large part of the life of a Jewish family was outside.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were just stalls along the road. The houses were made of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Few people live in Greenland. In the Norwegian sagas, Erik the Red had been exiled from Iceland because he had killed someone, and heading west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even if he made his discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Even if each country was 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But it's not true. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th of July 1776." These words can be seen at the bottom of the document, backwards.
Even if nobody knows who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning this large document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be put away.
So it is likely that this note was added as a tag.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by Vichy France. These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies had invaded the south of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared among a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, in relation to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas which means city or city-state, and which in some way defines the greatness of society.
The city-states are the ancestors of nations. A culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge across generations, a cultural imprint that lasts, and a fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical traces and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially had formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component, under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no executive or national judiciary to enforce all its laws, it often relied on the state authorities, which often did not cooperate.
They did not even have the authority to annul fiscal laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles require unanimous consent from all the states before being amended, and the states have allowed the central government to gain power so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is like the German national football team, the second team that has won the most in the world, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One races.
Winter sports are famous especially in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world.
Due to the groups of islands it has, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors had called the island Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southeastern part of Taiwan, starting to change the indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers in the rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) gained control over the western part and the northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki through which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can get a better idea of how they must have looked in the past.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt, and the restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the film format par excellence at the end of the analog film era.
It's done again today, but the most important thing is that its aspect ratio was inherited from the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is consequently called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the group of APS formats) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and frequently criticized rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
She says that the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has held European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His power encompassed everyone, from kings to the poor.
One of the main doctrines of Christians is that abundance should be used to alleviate tribulations and misery, and that the Church's money is there for this purpose.
The center of control of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and all this power and money have led many to question whether the doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the hostilities began, the English established a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was successful, cutting essential civilian and military support, even though this blockade was a violation of an international law generally accepted and codified by many international agreements in the two centuries prior.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters to block entire parts of the ocean to all ships, causing damage even to neutral ships.
Since there was little to be done against this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude of almost all the citizens and countries was one of pacifism and isolation.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another similar event in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to work with the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States without money, with a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different periods of the year: each phase of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was a relatively unsettled period with divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was that of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were terrible wars among the various nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit at the highest seat of the great palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Even after the Revolution and the occupation, everything was open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious to achieve success.
The same applies to the military because instead of classifying the army based on class, now it was based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The same cave, having survived through the ages, offers a very vivid image of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
Perched on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find it even though it was known to exist. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen but the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the most imposing), several small tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Cheops.
The "arched upwards" sign looks like a V and the "arched downwards" sign like a small hook or a square without the bottom side.
This means that you should start from the frog and push the bow, and already signifies that you should start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bowing higher up usually produces a softer sound, while a bowing lower down usually produces a stronger and more decisive sound.
Feel free to write your marks in pencil, but remember that the printed bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the King’s sister, Lady Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789, in Versailles, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris.
He returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and hurled threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At a certain point, someone in the crowd showed the head of a royal guard cut off at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the Filipino people themselves.
He was forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the expenses and the interests on bonds changed in the name of the Filipino government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would have constituted the fundamental conquests of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that encouraged the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time period in European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The middle phase of the Middle Ages came after the first phase of the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism has many ideas, from the technological drive or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by basic logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two ideas: the development of technology itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence, and conversely, technology has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car engine necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a network of national roads is not economically viable just for a few cars, therefore there are new production methods being developed to lower the cost of having a car.
Having many cars also leads to many accidents on the roads, and this leads to the invention of new medical techniques to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism depicted by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures emerged tied to that geography, and these, being in harmony with society, turned out to be better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris today is known to be the capital of fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It is known for having been a center of luxury from 400 to 1100.
Their esteem declined in the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine market offered.
It is in this period that the title of Capital of Luxury passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style had its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles would have been able to remain 25-30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the era was that, following the Crusades, people began using buttons on their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the agriculture aimed at the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses heirloom seeds native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.

Subcultures can be distinguished according to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or generated by a specific combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and speech.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, bad luck, or intentional abuse, were not monitored from a social perspective by adults during their growth.
These kids are called "wildlings." Some of them were placed within people's boundaries (usually by their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical impairment of the child.
The wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or before escaping.
It is thought that some have been raised by animals; it is said that some have lived in the wild state.
When completely raised by non-human animals, the child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that cared for them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
What is defined as scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support that provides assistance to people who are facing a new learning experience such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
These scaffolds called scaffolds can be either virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but it is also the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual platforms are integrated into the software with the aim of discussing, suggesting, and explaining procedures that might be difficult for individual students to manage.
The children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safety for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring aides, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide everything that is missing in the home from which the children were previously taken.
Internet unites elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet have already brought other dimensions of uses and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James and others 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important insights in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can understand if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess someone's sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals like dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and the selection removes it from the expressed variation pool.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to satisfy its need for amino acids by gathering them from the available plant resources.
Moreover, the inability to do it has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a somewhat similar way to how savanna chimpanzees do it today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively gentle alarm to bring you to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you happen to reset the alarm clock while you're sleeping, the latter might be positioned on the other side of the room, thus forcing you to get up from bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm involve the consumption of many fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that characterizes a person is correlated to the amount of tension present in the body and in the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded through the path of Mahayana love and through many techniques typical of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of global love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened through yoga positions themselves, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Divinity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment takes shape.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading the USSR and the United States to collaborate. With the end of the war, the clashes of systems, processes, and cultures caused the decline of the nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and thus began the Cold War.
It would have gone on for the next 40 years and would have been truly fought by the mandate armies and their battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been defeated, and the only hope left was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian outpost.
However, these plans had already become almost outdated from today to tomorrow when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union broke through the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that the nation maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have been able to conquer England as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used to keep them for milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often overseen by goatherds who were often boys and young men, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These ways of herding are still used today.
The wagons had already been built in England in the 16th century.
Even if the wagons were only wooden planks placed side by side, they allowed the horses that pulled them to go faster and to pull heavier loads compared to the broken roads of the time.
The hurdles were placed almost immediately to keep the tracks in position. However, little by little it was understood that the tracks would be better with an iron bar on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron rusts and the wood of the wagons decays.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first railway made entirely of iron was built.
The first means of transportation was feet; humans started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus emerged (which means upright man).
Those who were there before, the Australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
The bipedal characteristic has been found in the fossils of australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living better together with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can also become more active in trying to somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, this is like treating the symptoms. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, now we need to find the cause of the problems and solve them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become even bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten copy signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was then sent to a few isolated locations at a distance to the printing office of John Dunlap.
During the night they made between 150 and 200 copies known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy ended up in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have bodies with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are represented by binary digits, or bits, to use the computer jargon.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately visible. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open box of medicine or toxic chemical products around the house.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The word "zimeso" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
It derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs which are insects adapted to infest humans.
The placement of chairs and the arrangement of beds are minimal, suitable for living in the attic or in the guest house.
In all of the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women have twice the likelihood of getting MS compared to men.
A couple can decide that having a child is not in their interest, or in the interest of the child.
these couples can decide to try to adopt a child.
In an adoption, the rights of the biological parents end so that another couple can act as parents to the child.
The main objective of science is to understand, using the scientific method, how the world works. This method, in fact, drives almost all scientific discoveries.
However, it is not only experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, as well as to ask questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers were focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
The ideas of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology, had been accepted.
Once knowledge of Greek began to decline, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production with biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for a large part of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will carry on a free-running cycle period even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was made of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by marking the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the cells of the germ line can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism appeals to people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the fauna and flora.
Examples of activities to do on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and getting to know the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave by car from the small countryside villages to go to work and are passed by others who go to work where they have just left from.
In this transport system, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science says that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the means of transportation. Almost everyone complains about the means of transportation.
In developed countries, it's rare to hear complaints about the quality of the water or about bridges collapsing.
Why do the means of transportation cause so many complaints, why do they have problems every day? Do the transport engineers not understand anything? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have among themselves.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent limit; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented in a mathematical way.
To better represent traffic flow, relations have been established among the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape from predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This gives it the possibility to hide from predators in many small places.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the mayfly and the caddisfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some thought that he was right but others thought the opposite, that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and also other stars).
This seems like a sensible thing because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest one on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river; in some places, it is six miles wide.
A good 20 percent of the river water that ends up in the planet's oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size and in the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its official legislation and communication.
Italian is also the common language used by almost everyone who works in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these could be found in nature in a pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals like gold and silver.
Steel can also be alloys that have a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil has been a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the arrival of newer writing methods, the pencil has ended up on the sidelines and is used less.
People now write messages on computer screens, they don't need a pencil sharpener.
One might wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something newer comes out.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The fission of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to split with little or no prompting.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is finer under the seas and thicker under the plateaus.
There could be seas on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. It has been easier for the lava to come out to the surface.
Content theories are focused on researching what makes people angry or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized while becoming adults.
These theories look at what is in certain people that makes them desire the things they do and which things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to misunderstandings between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must have the same standards of excellence as normal teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of virtual teams often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often they have more autonomy than the members of a normal team because their teams can be located according to different time zones that might not be understood by the local administration.
Even the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administration team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the process that takes time to establish a learning organization? Innovation is an objective to put the concepts of organizational learning into practice.
When all available resources are used well across the functional departments of an organization, one can see creativity and ingenuity.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), says that the Continuum approach is a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical strategy in the investigation of its knowledge. As a result, it narrows the area of investigation and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the scientists in this research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors have an effect on behavior and cause changes to certain mental functions.
The new technologies allow us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to make simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Even if Artificial Intelligence has something of science fiction, it is such an important part of computer science, and it has to do with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
The study of AI concerns the creation of machines to automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnosis and customer queries, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is often used today in economics, medicine, engineering, and in the military field, given that it has been implemented in many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are a very important thing for every class. Many times the teacher would like to take their students to places where it is not possible to go by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual trips. Students can view the works of a museum, visit an aquarium, or view art while sitting in class.
Sharing a trip virtually is also a nice way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is re-done, but the old versions are kept online like a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students write better. While students often start their blogging experience with grammar errors and misspelled words, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer strives to write better and to avoid criticisms.
Moreover, having a blog "pushes the students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to nurture the interest of the public inspires students to be more skilled and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning well beyond the normal school day.
A proper use of blogs "can lead students to become more analytical and critical; with active responses to internet material, students can define their positions in the context of what others write as well as describe their personal perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the beautiful and bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south there is Niagara Falls and to the north there is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and even more show Ontario as the quintessence of Canada to those coming from outside.
Many areas even further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost entirely natural and uninhabited areas.
A comparison of populations that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and in terms of wildlife, it is a continent in itself.
A large part of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was particularly successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and European colonialism started in the 15th century, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama who found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel and to the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: better that all the women who travel say they are married, it doesn't matter if it's true or not.
Better to also wear a ring (as long as it doesn't look like something flashy).
Women need to understand that cultural differences might be what they perceive as annoying, and it's not unusual to be followed, touched, grabbed by the arm, etcetera.
You must be determined in telling men no, and not be afraid to assert your reasons (cultural differences or not, it's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port, called Anfa, by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese demolished and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by Spanish traffickers who had established a trafficking base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco for shopping.
Around the old Medina, you can find places that sell traditional Moroccan items like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but it's all tourist stuff.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano, which burned most of the city's roads, particularly in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any other trip outside of Goma must be prepared in such a way as to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the least expensive gorilla tracking expeditions in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Along with the fact that it is relatively difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has become more of a metaphor for exotic and distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its fame makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main episodes of the PBS special "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in strong contrast with other cities in the country, because it has a charm that is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting various wild animals.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the symbol of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all the National Parks of South Africa, there are daily entrance and conservation fees to the park.
It might be a good idea to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry into a selection of parks in South Africa or into all the National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place most visited by tourists.
The series of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering bar graph, recognizable by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, go across to the island and go to Kowloon on the waterfront on the other side.
Much of the urban development on the island of Hong Kong is largely situated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers had taken for themselves, and therefore, if you want to see something of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending for 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the territory of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only mangrove swamps - they also have what remains of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans have an area of 3850 km² of which one-third is water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and an estimate says that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.

Since inter-district buses are often full, it's better to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable means of transport for going to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise up to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge has been operational since September 2017, with the checkpoints of the Brazilian customs having been completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant ethnic group living in Eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurù and the Payaguà, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, first called “the gigantic province of the Indies,” was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the period of colonization which lasted for three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments are also played in other parts of the year.
For news on the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, have a look at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is fixed equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is in Stanley, in front of the FIC West shop.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are also often accepted.
In the outer islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and American currencies might work well; check with the concerned parties in advance to see what payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside of the islands, so change your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 degrees are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cool; the temperatures rarely go below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no particularly "wet" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even if many of the park's mammals are used to seeing humans, wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from any other wild animal!
No matter how docile they seem, bison, deer, reindeer, bears, and any other large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they have not kept an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking fragrant foods and keep the base camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British ocean liner. At least 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the murder of the great leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is between two harbors. The most famous ones are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches, with some shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
There are family beaches sometimes with too many people, with many shops. Ours is safe.
The main local beer is the "Number One", it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to try, but the New Zealand and Australian ones might be better.
Tap water can be drunk just fine, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," the cappuccino arrives filled to the top with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard. The fruit juices are expensive but they are excellent.
Many tours to the coral barrier are made throughout the year, and accidents from these causes on the barrier are rare.
Anyway, follow what the authorities say, obey the signs, and pay attention to the safety signals.
The box jellyfish are found near the beaches and the neighboring river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of these periods.
Sharks exist but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance and peace of mind that there will be a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
The travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, even though you can book other places to stay, like campsites, again with a travel agency.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transport options to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think it over or to obtain the documents for your arrival (for example, a visa).
Any change or request would have to go through the agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For certain festivals, the vast majority of the participants at music festivals choose to camp on site, and most of them consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to enter early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage is over, there might still be parts of the festival where it plays until late at night.
Certain festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, watch where the cabin is, because going across the ice causes a terrible noise for everyone involved.
The cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. The passengers of the cruises are exempt from the visa requirement (check the regulations).
The casinos often make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by the customers. The windows and clocks are often absent, and the exits can be difficult to find.
Usually, they have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers in a good mood and continue to make them spend money.
Local venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who wants to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On the icy and snowy roads, the grip is low and you cannot drive as if you were on the asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to block you in a short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, the conditions of snow and ice are normal in many countries, and the traffic continues uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular use refers to the journey on land to observe the incredible African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach the vehicles and the standard equipment allows a good view.
The lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of a walking excursion, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other sites throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might find yourself in a complicated situation.
The rules on cancellations vary, but in March the cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
It is expected that most events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the typical ticket being sold for 7,000 yen.
Ironing my clothes can be done after they dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available on loan, even if one is missing from the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't feel like ironing your socks, you can use a hairdryer, if it is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can make it shrink or, in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against certain types of threats.
In certain areas boiling water for a minute is enough, in others several minutes are needed.
The filters vary in effectiveness, and if you should have a problem you can consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can catch parasites they are not accustomed to in their place of origin.
Harmful animals can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases spread, or dangerous animals that harm or kill people by force are usually not classified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping represents the opportunity to buy goods tax-free and can be found in certain specific places.
Travelers coming from countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: significant slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The indicated speed limits are quite a bit lower than in the previous and subsequent sessions - commonly 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and adherence to these limits is even more important than in other circumstances.
Curiously, however, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than in other parts of the route, like in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry shops are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are really rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with cooked apples present in desserts all year round, and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German baked dishes have almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a shot of strong coffee.
If you want small, rich pastries, try the one that depending on the place is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.

The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang low on both sides of the saddle.
They provide more stability to the rider but can present safety issues due to the potential for a rider to get caught.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged away if the horse starts to run. To minimize this risk, it is necessary to take a series of safety precautions.
First of all, most of the horsemen wear riding boots with a heel and a sole that is smooth and quite narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that prevent the stirrup from getting stuck in the saddle if a rider falls.

Ski mountaineering as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
It is related but usually does not include skiing or mountaineering, since these last two activities are done on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing itinerary as similar to a similar hiking itinerary.
With good conditions, you can cover more distance than by walking - but only rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across different countries would require submitting several visa applications and having one's passport checked on many occasions.
The Schengen Area, however, in this respect acts as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having your passport checked.
In the same way, having a Schengen visa means you don't have to apply for a visa to visit each Schengen member separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition on which handmade goods can be defined as antiques. Certain tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.

Rip currents are the flow that returns from the waves breaking on the beach, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the returning flow is concentrated in certain deeper sections, and there a fast current can form towards the depths.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of the effort to swim backward against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you emerge from the current, going back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to direct yourself towards places where nothing will happen to you, or, depending on your abilities or the fact that you have been noticed or not, you might expect a rescue.
The shock of returning arrives before the culture shock (there is not even a "honeymoon" phase), it lasts longer, and it can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When you return home after living away, you adapt to the new culture and lose some of your habits from your old culture.
When you travel somewhere for the first time, people are probably patient and understanding, as they know that travelers have to adapt to a new country.
People do not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary here for travelers returning home.

Going boating is the national pastime in Finland, there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
The same thing exists in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand but for the rest, it's quite unique (in Holland the ratio is one to forty).

The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to fork out a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
In any case, it's certainly not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times what you pay in economy for business, and eleven for first class!
In general, there is no reason to look for discounts for business class or first class on direct flights between A and B.
The airlines know well that there is a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and in comfort, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.

You are requested to treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site with marks or scratches on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, and a vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
