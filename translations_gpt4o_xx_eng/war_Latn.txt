This not only confirms that at least some other dinosaurs had feathers, a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that are often not preserved in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional texture.
Scientists say that this animal has a chestnut-brown color on top with a pale or carotenoid color underneath.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the feathers of the dinosaur did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other feather characteristics — barbs and barbules — researchers concluded that the rachis was a later development in evolution compared to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they are not used for flying but for maintaining temperature or visibility. Researchers suggest that, even though it is a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not a chick's skin.
Researchers suggest that, even if it is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the sample displays adult feathers and not a chick's skin.

The brightness and rotation are simultaneously used to understand the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversals.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: the voter enters a booth alone, and places a pre-printed paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter roll.

The candidates may send their representatives to witness each part of the process. At night, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The weapons of Uka failed while aimed at the head of the fifth man. Schneider continually experienced dizziness, blindness in one eye, a missing part of the skull, and a face reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider testified via videolink from the USAF base in his place of birth.
Aside from the events on Wednesday, Carpanedo faced off against two individuals in the Championships.
His first event was the Slalom, where he received a Did Not Finish in his initial run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that round.
Her other event, the Giant Slalom, saw her finishing tenth among the women's group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher from Austria, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyongyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their run, and 45 out of 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to rank in the round.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who assaulted the woman from Switzerland and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The accused were named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the accused faced the court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
Meanwhile, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the emergency services helped the driver get out of the red Audi TT.
She was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterward, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya always goes to Edinburgh Sheriff Court as she is charged with the murder of her child.
He is in custody while awaiting trial and appearance, but any evidence found might be compromised because his image has already spread in public.
This kind of activity is common in other parts of the UK but justice operates differently in Scotland and the court viewed the publication of the photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said that "journalists seem to be walking a fine line when publishing photos and more of suspects."
The Crown Office, which handles the cases, explained to the journalists that no further comment would be released except during the trial.
The document, according to reports, points to disputes over loans, which the Palestine wants based on the agreements before the 1967 Mideast War.
Other discussed topics included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue in the Jordan Valley.
Israel mandates the continued presence of the military in the mountains for a period of ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to withdraw from such presence within just five years.
The marksmen in the additional trial for pest control should be monitored by the guards, because the trials are being observed and their effectiveness is being evaluated.
In coordination with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage along with the NPWS, the four selected shooters in the first shooting operation are receiving comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) which has nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a commission recommended the former stepping down of the CEP as part of a measure to transition the country to a new election.
The commission was Martelly's solution to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes-violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold the election, some of which date back to 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods due to excessive pressure have been recorded, which led to a total of six fires that caused minor burns to four people.
According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's lack of a permanent report "very primitive."
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 in the morning local time (09:19 in the evening GMT Friday).
The office of emergency management in the Northern Marianas stated that no national damages were reported to them.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there is no indication of a tsunami occurring.
A former Filipino policeman took hostage some Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six are confirmed dead for now.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were the first to be released, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Shortly after, the photographers exchanged places with an elderly woman because she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot and died.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor during his free time.
Her research shows that if the hormone can be controlled, it can accelerate the maturity of the lungs of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators retrieved two 'black box' recorders from the flight last Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also honored him.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the happiest Queen of Extreme. My happiest manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna is just like me in her love for making people laugh... maybe even more so... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place now."
Out of the 1,400 people who polled before the 2010 federal election, those against Australia becoming a republic decreased by 8 percent from 2008.
The analyst claimed that Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign believed that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those in the poll share the same view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch in Australia.
At the conclusion of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
An Olympic gold medalist needs to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to their complaints, their health was questioned.
They are unable to take the necessary medications to help recover from mental illness because these are prohibited by the Mulay.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been responsible for delivering water to Earth, along with organic compounds capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists expect to learn how the planets were formed, especially how the Earth was created, because comets have been colliding with Earth since long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He described the stories as "political gossip and nonsense".
It is estimated that he/she would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system proclaimed by the FAA that will allow airplanes to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the old ground-radar-based technology, allowing high-level traffic to control pinpoint aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional vehicles will be deployed and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and the car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be usable at the bottom.
The fears of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the arches would be forced to be carried behind closed doors without supporters of the group.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the creation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Island.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within just two generations, even though this process was believed to take much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into different forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
This can be wound with thin wire, which can be twisted and sewn. This can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
This can be made extremely thin and adhere to other metals. It can be made so thin that sometimes it is used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using the red juice of cabbage.
The juice of the cabbage changes in color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because the atoms of Hydrogen are made of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, using clean and dry hands, squeeze them together to form a ball.
The gloves on your hands react with the outer layers, which will feel pleasant and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
The remnants of the sewer system were found in houses in the cities of the Minoans in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, sometimes the toilets were part of the public baths where men and women would be together in a mixed company.
If you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then it is immediately sent back down.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and observations.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel changed the world in unimaginable ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is provide us with easier and faster transportation.
Boats, cars, and many other means of transportation were given to us.
Underneath this is just the right size of lions that have eaten just the right size of prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In the end, many small cats (including those that are not pets) ate smaller prey such as insects, frogs, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of adapting to the environment, a special task for each cat to avoid competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups known as prides.
The prides consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and their young.
The women are usually close to each other, like a large family of sister siblings and daughters.
The prides of lions hunt like packs of wolves or wild dogs, animals that have lion-like behavior (but not the big cats), and they are also capable of killing their prey.
A fierce athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The growl of a tiger is not the same as the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like the sound of fierce, shouting words.
Ocelots want to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can. Almost all animals caught by ocelots are smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and search for animals to eat (prey) by scent, which they detect wherever they are in the area.
They can see well even in the dark, with vision at night, and they move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then jumping at their prey.
If a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they move to the mountains or a river, or if they migrate to a new island so they cannot easily return), they usually find themselves in a different environment than where they originally lived.
This new environment has various resources and different competitors, so the new population will need to adapt different qualities or adjustments to become a strong competitor against what was previously required.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustment as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adjust to their new environment, they started observing that they were becoming smaller, similar to other populations.
In time, after hundreds of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have become different to the point that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
The plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and they also absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (this is what happens when you breathe out).
The plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and our clothes are made from plants. Plants are mostly what we eat. If there are no plants, the animals will not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, meaning it feared nothing, aside from other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws filled with the sharp teeth of 70 razor blades, along with an additional set on the roof of its mouth, means that nothing can escape whatever crosses its path.
Surely we do not know, but perhaps it had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might have even become a cannibal.
He attacks anything that enters the water, even the giant dinosaur like the T. rex is no match for him.
While we might be familiar with the majority of their food, the Romans also had unique or exotic feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich wanted to recline on their sides while eating their food.
The ancient foods in Rome did not include the foods that arrived in Europe from America or from Asia in the later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods which they considered the dwelling place of the deity.
People will bring sacrifices for the gods, and the priests will try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard at the entrance of the temple and an inner sanctuary that only the priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes they built special towers in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, to become part of the temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house is not important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family takes place outdoors.
The women are cooking in the forest; the stores are merely open stalls seen on the street. Stone is used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, which is why wood was very precious.
Only a few people live in Greenland. In Norse stories, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland because of murder, and during his journey further westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes had already been residing there in the past.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences among the people, rulers, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, this is not a map to treasure.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one can be certain who actually wrote it, it has been learned that at some point in its history, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Therefore, a notation might be added simply as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained unliberated.
This was mandated by the "Vichy" French. These were the French people who agreed to peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies occupied the southern part of France, and the occupation was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture characterized by a significant large group of people who live and work together cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and similarly describes the complexity of society.
The city-states are the beginnings of nations. A culture of civilization describes the transmission of knowledge to several generations, which remains a cultural legacy and equitable dissemination.
Most of the smaller cultures disappear without leaving evidence related to history and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—comprised of a Congress—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to enforce taxes, and, since there was no executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who sometimes did not cooperate, to implement all of its actions.
They still do not have authority to regulate tax laws and tariffs between states.
Articles require full approval from all states before they are amended, and the states only disregard the central government by just having their representatives absent.
The national football team of Italy, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
The most popular winter sports in the Northern regions, competed in by Italians in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan holds approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan, from a geographical standpoint, is considered an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when passing European explorers recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, which initiated a transformation in the local rice production activities and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is comprised of three primary structures, named the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what their original appearance was really like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
This is still being done now, but the aspect ratio is more important as it is followed by the digital camera image sensor formats.
In reality, the 35mm format is somewhat confusing; it is 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format family, for example) that closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The continued misuse and implementation of the third law is a simple guide to creating dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It is said that the most effective place for the main discussion is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion unified the states of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
The reach of all its power affects everyone from the king to the ordinary people.
One of the leading beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate hardship and poverty, and that the money of the church should be used solely for that purpose.
The center of the church's authority is in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money leads to many questions about whether these beliefs are being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has been proven effective, cutting off important military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade has violated several universally accepted international laws established by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined the international waters to prevent any ships from entering an entire section of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Because there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of the majority of residents and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations desired to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his first job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of illustrating various periods of time; each state of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
And in the middle of each dynasty was the unstable age of the disintegrating provinces. The most well-known of these times is the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times, fierce conflicts occurred among the many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the Three Kingdoms is the bloodiest period in the history of Ancient China, where thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country is owned by the people and not just by a single ruler.
After the Revolution, job opportunities were opened for all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
It is the same for the military because instead of the ranks of soldiers being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also provided inspiration to many other impoverished working-class citizens of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He would go to a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, provides a clear image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Located at the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, this is not easy to find even if one knows that it exists. Once inside the cave, the separation becomes complete.
There was nothing else to be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures erected to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead of Egypt, has several pyramids (with the great pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was made to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "up bow" mark is like a V and the "down bow" mark is like a staple or square without its bottom part.
"Karuyag sidngon han up amo an kinahanglan ka magtikang ha tumoy ngan igduso an bow, ngan karuyag sidngon han down amo an kinahanglan nimo magtikang ha frog (nga kon diin an imo kamot nakapot ha bow) ngan bunlota an bow." means "Up means you need to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you need to start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow."
Generally, an up-bow produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more forceful.
Do not hesitate to add your own markings, but remember that the printed bowings are there for musical reasons, so they should indeed be respected.
Forced to return was the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789, from Versailles due to a tumultuous group of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a noisy group of people shouting and hurling threats against the King and Queen.
The King and Queen were forced by the disruptive group of people to open the window of their carriage wide.
At one point, a member of the unruly group brandished the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The costs of the war of U.S. imperialism during the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to fulfill a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the huge profits that have been derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos will make up the main beneficiaries of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era during which most events generally referred to as the High Middle Ages occurred is a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas about the relationship between technology and society, from a push-technology perspective or the necessity of technology to the strict definition that human destiny is driven under the logic governed by the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism follow two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that motor vehicles need to contribute to the improvement of roads.
However, the entire national network cannot survive economically for just a small number of cars, so the new method of production was developed to reduce the cost of ownership.
The ownership of cars by the masses leads to a high incidence of road accidents, which resulted in the invention of a new method of treatment for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a significant element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures emerged related to this geography, and these, which are united in the realm of society, are better than the artificially imposed laws.
This way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is recognized as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as a center that originated from prosperity began around 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the twelfth century due to the fact that the Crusades brought back gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
That was the time when the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period in the middle of the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
From the beginning, the influence on the clothing of the Byzantine culture in the east was very significant.
However, due to the slow channels of communication, the style in the west was delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
Until the end of the Middle Ages, the West of Europe began developing their own style. One of the greatest achievements of the period as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the type of farming done to produce food that is just enough to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, predominantly organic system that uses collected native seeds in an ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yield.
Throughout history, most farmers have worked in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture that may differ could be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, customs, and their own language.
One of the most common ways used to demonstrate the importance of collaboration is by highlighting some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, did not receive care from adults as they were growing up.
Children like these are called "wild" or feral. Some of these wild children were imprisoned by people (mostly by their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical defects.
The aggressive youths may have experienced severe abuse when they were children or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are accused of being raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the forest.
If completely raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to those of the specific nurturing animal, such as his/her fear of or disregard towards humans.
While project-based learning can simplify and make learning more interesting, scaffolding adds another step.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning but a support that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be created both virtually and physically, meaning a teacher is a form of scaffold but also like that little paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
The Virtual Scaffolds are integrated into a software and designed to ask questions, explain, and elaborate methods that could help students work independently.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many different reasons including neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that is neglectful, oppressive, and uneducational, yet they do.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, reliable education, and accountable healthcare.
The foster care must provide all the needs that were lacking in the residence from which they were taken.
The Internet has converged the elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique nature of the internet has led to increased scrutiny regarding usage and strategies for delivering pleasure.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" were suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal interaction” and “continuing relationship” were also recognized as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their investigation of viewer reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by accurately interpreting subtle facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, described how some people who couldn't understand the speech because of brain damage could still comprehend the sincerity of what was being said.
It is even suggested that such an ability to interpret human behavior might also be given to animals like perceptive dogs.
Research in the twentieth century shows that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation introduces new genetic variation, which selection removes from the group of expressed variation.
The alternating separation and reconnection rearrange the variation frequently between the two groups in each generation.
Outside in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human to meet the amino acid requirements solely from plant sources.
Furthermore, the failure to do this has serious consequences: slow growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest sources of plant-based proteins are those found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (meat, fish, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a high amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In contemplating all things, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimps do today in the forest.
Sleep interruption is a process of intentional waking during your normal sleeping hours and then going back to sleep shortly afterward (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a softly ringing alarm clock to bring you into a state where you are not fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it in another part of the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which forces a person to get up and urinate.
The amount of peace within that a person has is the opposite of the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive forces are present in life. Each individual has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Each individual has the potential to reach enlightenment. The only obstacle in the path to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is expanded with the Mahayana path of compassion and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. Through visualization of various gods, the energy pathways are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is achieved.
Germany, a common opponent during World War 2, was at the forefront of cooperation between the USSR and USA. After the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the collapse of nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become adversaries, and the Cold War began.
This will last for the next 40 years of true conflict, through surrogate soldiers, in fights from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were no longer useful within just one night, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most effective way today of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the seas.
The traditional job of the navy is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and things, while at the same time, disrupting the ability of your adversary to move their people and things.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were attempting to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the allies failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain just like the remaining parts of Europe.
The goats were among the first to be domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Past cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for quick access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are usually placed in herds that roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by young shepherds or adolescents, similar to the more well-known shepherds. This method of herding is still used today.
The railways were established in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the wagons were made of the same type of wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them to achieve a faster speed and to haul larger loads compared to the somewhat more difficult roads of earlier times.
Earlier, crossties were introduced to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be better if they had a portion of steel on top.
This task became common, but the steel caused more severe damage to the wooden structures of the wagons.
At the feast, wheels made of wood were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first entirely iron rail was introduced.
The first known means of transportation is walking. People began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
The ones before them, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is customary.
The bipedal specializations can be seen in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it's possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live in harmony with the environment, we can help in the movement for the environment, and we can even become activists to lessen the future suffering in some areas.
This is just like a symptom of treatment in many cases. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to eliminate them.
It is very clear that the world has greatly changed due to human advancements in science and technology, and the problems have increased because of the excessive population and the luxurious lifestyles of people.
After this was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Throughout the entire night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon at the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are living today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that are still very similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet covered with scales and claws, they roar, and they walk using their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately visible. The symptoms, such as vomiting, can be so general that a quick diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of poisoning indoors can be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific instructions for that specific thread.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists with a formal definition for this group of insects.
This term is taken from the familiar Lice, insects well-known as parasites in humans.
Both assassin bugs and flower bugs are nidicolous, adapting to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the entire United States of America, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Researchers have learned that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A married couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their children.
These couples may choose to make a plan for their child's adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights as parents so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary aim of science is to understand how the world works in a scientific way. This approach to truth guides most scientific investigations.
Although it is not unique, experimentation and an experiment are attempts used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations, and they also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
The teachings of Aristotle were accepted in all discussions on science, including psychology.
While knowledge in Greek was slowly fading, the West found itself losing the philosophical and scientific origins of this knowledge.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just simple responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue in a free-running cycle period, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment is one of the leading suggestions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people interested in visiting natural places for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, as well as the plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their workplace, and some find that the destination of their work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation, everything appears to be connected and supported by a transportation system based on private vehicles.
It has been shown by science today that this major carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you seldom hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are transportation systems the cause of such complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or did something else happen first?
The Movement of Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
It's disheartening, studying traffic movement is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers have the possibility to move within a reasonable and consistent range; thus, the movement of traffic may have certain reasonable similarities and can be presented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships among the three main variables have been established: (1) flow (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from predators more quickly and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back onto their bodies.
It gives them a broader area in a small place to hide from their captors.
Currently, the only insects that do not fold their wings are flies and dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Several people believe he is correct, but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it is not understood how the Earth seems to move, isn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries over 8 times more water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is still the widest river in the world, sometimes six miles wide.
The entire 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale of the pyramids of Giza and the technical excellence of their construction were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of the ancient Egyptians was amazed at their earlier monuments, which were once still over a thousand years old.
The population in Vatican City is about 800. This is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The City of Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is still the daily language used by most state employees while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the leading chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of these can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to mine using ancient tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more aligned with the four states of matter (in the same sequence): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though it also gave a theory that these change into new compounds to form what we see.
Alloys are usually a combination of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can still have alloys that include a small amount of non-metal elements such as carbon.
All things in the Universe are made of matter. All things are made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them can fit in a period at the end of these sentences.
Therefore, a pencil is a good friend to many people when it comes out.
It's sad that as new writing methods developed, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and use.
People now write messages on the computer screen, no longer needing to approach a typewriter.
One can only think about what the keyboard will become if a newer version comes out.
A fission bomb operates on the principle of needing energy to split a nucleus that has many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a cart down a hill. The fission of the nucleus releases some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can easily disintegrate without much external force.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick in the near region and 100 km thick in the far region.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the mountains.
There might still be magma in nearby areas because the crust is thinner. It is easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The theories of content focus on finding what makes people tick or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have needs and/or desires that are applied while they are at the right age or maturity.
These theories look into certain people and what drives them to like the things they do and what things in their environment could lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In the overall story, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is attempting to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, one can become an unrecognized individual who feels the need to change everything the group is doing and do it on their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the group.
This behavior often results in misunderstandings between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
The members of the virtual team usually serve as the point of contact of their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy compared to traditional team members because their team might gather across different time zones that their local manager might not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a distinct aspect of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which each of the members report. The invisible team sets benchmarks for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process of building an organization focused on learning? One goal for embedding learning concepts in an organization is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized throughout the functional departments of an organization, creativity and knowledge can occur.
As a result, the process of an organization collaborating to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as the sharing of knowledge and skills within the organization.
Angel (2006) explained the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Thus, it narrows the field of research and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that the different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to observe and examine the structures and processes of the brain that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information to create simulation models that can help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms one of the most important branches of computer science, involving behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Along with research in AI is the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Included in the examples are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and inquiries, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now primarily used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as well as being present in some home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Usually, a teacher wants to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides a solution for virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
The sharing of a virtual field trip is also a great way to present a journey and experiences to future classes.
For example, every year the students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital; each year the website's content is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing. Even though students often start their blogs using sloppy grammar and spelling based on their experiences, the overall presence of an audience changes that.
Because students are usually the most critical audience, the blog writer is striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "pushes students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to cultivate interest in audiences inspires students to be knowledgeable and engaging. (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can give meaning to their positions in the context of the writings of others as well as outline their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
In the farther southern part of Niagara Falls and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more are what promote in Ontario what is considered truly Canadian by outsiders.
The large areas in the north are not very populated and some are almost uninhabited forests.
For comparison of the population that surprised many: There are more African Americans living in the US than the residents in Canada.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean on the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the lands, and this was significantly adopted in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is surrounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It is recommended that any woman who is traveling should claim that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It would still help to wear a ring (not just the very expensive ones).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment and uncommon behaviors, such as being followed, grabbed by the arm, and so on.
Be strong in refusing men, and do not be afraid to stand up (cultural differences or not, it will not be okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and was rebuilt under the name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco as Daru I-Badya and was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the not very interesting places for shopping in the whole of Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina, it is easier to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a full spectrum of trinkets, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a city for tourists located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from Mount Nyiragongo, which covered most of the town's roads, especially in the town center.
While Goma is still a safe place, any visits outside of Goma need to be examined to understand the state of ongoing clashes in the northern province of Kivu.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest treks for observing Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Accompanied by the relative inaccessibility of this place, "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for a distant, exotic land.
Now, Timbuktu is a struggling town, even though its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of world heritage sites at risk due to the threats of desert sands.
This is one of the leading stops during the special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city is located in a strong contrast to other cities in the country because it has more Arabic knowledge compared to African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is situated in the expanse of the border of Mozambique in the north, and the northern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a diverse range of wildlife.
This is a leading attraction in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation fee and an entrance fee for the park.
It might still be useful for someone who buys a Wild Card, which grants entry to any of the park selections in South Africa or to all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is being highlighted as a major tourist focus and the territory of Hong Kong is being given prominence in its name.
The array of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong is likened to a striking bar chart reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across.
The significant development of the Hong Kong Island province is concentrated on the area of reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world, extending about 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the territory of India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Even the forests are not only mangroves—they include some of the latest remaining large forests that once covered the plains of the Gangetic region.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², where about one-third is water or swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the whole day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because inter-district buses are usually full, it is advised to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it has a total length of 378 meters and it consists of two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the checkpoints at Brazil's customs are expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most significant indigenous group living in Eastern Paraguay today, who live as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers also skilled in agricultural subsistence.
The Chaco region is the dwelling of other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who thrived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The period of colonization that lasted for three centuries was started by the Spaniards.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has continuously preserved many of its indigenous customs and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the most competitive polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year took place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
The smaller tournaments and matchups can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For the news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches, see the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is set to be equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley, credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards might not be accepted, even if British and United States currency might be accepted; inquire in advance with the owners to understand what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is warm there when it is cold in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical area; during the warmer months, it is common for temperatures to rise above +30°C.
The cold can be deceptively chilling: the temperatures rarely drop into the cold, but the wind and moisture contribute to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no particular "wet" and "dry" season: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, maintain a distance of no less than 100 yards/meters from bears or wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they fail to keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port is the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when the seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the movement for freedom organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the killing of the most important leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location on two harbors. The most well-known is in the three places.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are situated along the Pacific Ocean, extending from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost entirely sandy beaches safe for swimming and with plenty of shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches along Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour, above the suburban markets of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes this small beach town is visited by families as there are many stores lined up along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The leading local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complicated beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be enjoyable to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water can be quickly found if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. The short black is the 'espresso', the cappuccino is filled with cream (not froth), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is based on Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but very delicious.
Many trips to the reefs are made throughout the year, and damage due to any reasons to the reefs is rare.
Even so, still seek advice from the authorities, follow all the signs, and pay attention to the safety reminders.
The box jellyfish appear near the beaches and near the river estuaries from October to April to the north of 1770. Occasionally, they can be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
The Saltwater Crocodile is not an active inhabitant of the ocean; their primary habitat is located in the river estuaries to the north from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you might find it possible to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can still hold the reservation for you if you need more time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests must first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For several festivals, most of the attendants at music festivals decide to camp on site, and many of the attendants consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to enter early to get a camping site near the music.
Remember that even though the music may end in the main parts, there might still be portions of the fiesta where music will continue to be played until midnight.
Some festivals have a special camping area for families with small children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, be mindful of the cabin location, as passing through ice can cause a disturbing noise for the most affected.
Included in the journeys to Saint Petersburg is time in the town. The cruise passengers are exempt from the required visas (see the terms).
Casinos usually make considerable efforts to increase the time and money spent by visitors. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and it is difficult to find the exits.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them in the place.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks at home. Likewise, intoxication impairs judgment, and everyone knows that a good adviser is aware of the importance of staying in the right mind.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a blizzard, the right amount of snow to trap you can fall in a short time.
The visibility can still be limited by the falling or blowing of snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the opposite side, freezing conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues with almost no interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris might be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling over land to see the fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, usually get close to vehicles, and standard equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or going "footing") consists of hiking, which can be done within several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia that has hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
