This does not confirm only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already well established, but it also offers details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a lighter underside or with carotenoid pigments.
The study also offers information regarding the evolution of plumage in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft, called rachis, but had other characteristics of feathers (such as vanes and barbules), researchers deduced that the rachis probably developed later in the evolution of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers have suggested that, even if the tail is from a young dinosaur, the specimen displays the plumage of an adult and not the down of a young bird.

The effect that the team was looking for would have had to be caused by the tidal forces within the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, thus determining the tides, the same way the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in exactly the same way as normal matter.
This theory claims that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in the form of a halo and is made of many small particles.

In France voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: the voters isolate themselves inside a booth and put a pre-printed paper sheet into an envelope, with the chosen candidate marked.
Once the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope into the ballot box for counting and signs the electoral list.
The French electoral law very precisely codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes used for counting must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside them for tampering with the vote and that no envelopes are added, only those from voters counted and authorized in an appropriate manner.
The candidates can send representatives to attend every phase of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and following very precise procedures.

According to the law, violent video games sold in the state of California must have a label with "18" written on it and their sale to minors can be punished with a fine of 1000 dollars per offense.
The director of public prosecutions, lawyer Kier Starmer, made a statement this morning announcing the legal proceedings against Huhne and Pryce.
Huhne has resigned and he will be replaced in government by the deputy Ed Davey. In Davey's place, at the Ministry for Work, will go the deputy Norman Lamb.
Huhne and Pryce should appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims were Nicholas Alden (25 years old) and Zachary Cuddeback (21 years old). Cuddeback was at the place of duty.
Edgar Veguilla injured an arm and the jaw, and Kristoffe Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's gun jammed when it was pointed at the head of a certain man. Schneider suffers from chronic pain, the loss of an eye and no longer has a piece of his skull and has a face reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a video from a distance while being at a USAF base in his homeland.
About the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo also competed in two individual races at the Championships.
His/her first race was the slalom, which he/she did not finish in the first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In other competitions, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the group of seated skiers with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place finisher, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place finisher, Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the seeded group of skiers did not finish the race, and 45 out of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom did not place in the rankings.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The individuals have been identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki has stated that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.

The road where the accident happened has been temporarily closed while the emergency services were extracting the driver from his red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya at that time is in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of having killed her son.
She is in custody waiting for the charge and the trial, but the statements of the eyewitnesses may be falsified, since her photograph has been published almost everywhere.
This practice is common throughout the rest of the United Kingdom but the Scottish judicial system functions differently and therefore behind the court the publication of photographs is potentially prejudicial.
The professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee has pointed out that "the journalists really seem to want to cross a dangerous line by publishing photos and other things of the suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for judicial processes, has declared to journalists that it will not make further comments at least until a charge is made.
According to the news source, the document will concern the issue of borders that Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the Middle East War of 1967.
It has been reported that other covered topics concern the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years from when the agreement will be signed, whereas Palestine approves of a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the integrative experiment for controlling invasive species had to be strictly supervised by the forest guards, while the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation between the NPWS and the Australian Association of Sporting Shooters (NSW Inc), qualified volunteers have been selected within the framework of the shooters' association program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director of conservation and heritage parks for NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation were trained and have received complete instruction on safety regulations.
Martelly yesterday formed a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It is Martelly's fourth CEP account in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the chief executive as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the large protests against the regime that started in October.
The protests, sometimes even violent, were caused by the lack of elections which, in part, should have still been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunction due to overheating in iPods have been registered, with a total of six that caught fire causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has reported knowledge of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company had described as "not serious."
The Ministry responded by defining Apple's communication delay as "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 in the morning local time (Friday at 9:19 in the evening GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damages have been reported in the state.
Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took hostage a group of Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Various tools have been secured and it has been confirmed that for now at least six people have lost their lives.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, had been released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed the bathroom. Mendoza was dismissed.
Liggins went after his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied as an obstetrician and in 1959 he started working in the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While he was working in the hospital, Liggins started studying premature births in his free time.
Her research showed that administering a hormone accelerated fetal lung maturation in the fetus.
According to Xinhua, on Wednesday, government investigators found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders.
Other wrestling fighters have also honored Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a Monday night, a unique thing just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was strange like me... maybe even more so... I loved her very much and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place than this."
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the federal elections of 2010, those who were against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the respondents have the same opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those interviewed want Australia to become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent want Australia to never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have been won in the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his troubles, his physical form was in doubt.
He could not get the medications he needed to not feel the pain because they are prohibited in the markets.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number in history.
More people have verified the discovery using various hardware and software on the February attack and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water for Earth and also of organic materials that can form proteins and thus support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth was formed, given that comets have collided with the Earth over a long period.
Cuomo (53 years old) became governor at the beginning of the year and last month he signed a law for the legalization of same-sex marriages.
He said that the voices were "nonsense and political stupidity".
It is said that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that according to the FAA will help airplanes fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses a technology based on satellites, as opposed to older technology based on ground radar, to allow air traffic controllers to identify planes more accurately and provide more precise information to pilots.
No additional transports will be added and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking spaces for cars or park-and-ride facilities there are not available.
The fear of lack of transportation has led to the hypothesis that the match may have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
According to researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, the species developed within just two generations, even though it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to hybridization between a Darwin's finch (endemic species), Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch (immigrant species), Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked to give it all kinds of shapes and it can also be rolled into small shapes.
You can pull it, making it become a thread that can be twisted and intertwined. You can beat it or flatten it into sheets.
You can make it very fine and you can attach it to other materials. You can make it so fine that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-made designs in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. An indicator can be created through the extraction of purple cabbage.
The cabbage juice changes color according to the acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of the chemical substance.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substances.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
You have to mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, you have to form a ball.
The humidity of your hands reacts with external layers, this will give a strange sensation and will form a sort of coating.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with a water drainage system connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, in Persia, and in China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes also found in public baths, which were open both to men and to women.
When you call someone who is many miles away, a satellite is used.
The space satellite receives the call and then almost immediately reflects it down.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a missile. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, a giant missile, over 100 feet tall, is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest advantage that the wheel has given us is that transportation has become much faster and easier.
We brought the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Under these, there are also medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there also exist many small felines (like house cats) that eat much smaller and more numerous prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special role that each feline has, which thus does not put them in competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
In the prides, there are usually up to three adult male lions related to each other and up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
The men are usually closely related, as it is a large family of brothers and sons.
The prides of lions behave in a way similar to the packs of wolves or dogs, animals that in behavior resemble lions in a surprising way (but not other big cats) and are equipped for hunting.
A true athlete, the tiger can also climb (although not very well), swim, jump quite far, and pull with a strength five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (or the Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as full as that of the lion but it sounds more like a purr, like when a cat purrs.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find their prey (or their food targets) through smell, sniffing the ground where the prey is located.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move in a very stealthy manner. The ocelots catch prey by camouflaging with the environment and then jumping onto the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) becomes separated from the main source population (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river or if they go to a new island from which it is difficult to return) they will find themselves in an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment has diverse resources and different arrivals, so the new population will need characteristics or different adaptations to become a good competitor compared to what was necessary before.
The original population hasn't changed at all and still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it starts to resemble less and less the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have an appearance so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
The plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans expel (that is, they release with their breath).
The plants produce their nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Men build houses and make clothes using plants. Most of the food that humans eat is plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything, except for other mosasaurs.
Her long jaw was wreathed in more than seventy well-arranged teeth, paired with another row of teeth in the sky of the mouth, so there was no escape for what or who was in front of it.
It is not known for certain, but it may have had a two-pointed tongue. Its diet included ammonites, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may also have been cannibalistic.
It devoured everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not have competed with it.
Even if most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual things to eat, such as wild boar, peacock, dormice, and a type of rat called glis.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the noble men liked to chat in company, reclining on their sides while they ate.
The diets of the ancient Romans could not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia much later.
For example they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever searched for turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods which was considered as the house of the god.
The people would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to attend to the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivities.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then a sanctuary inside where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes shaped like a pyramid, called ziggurats, they were built as part of temples.
The bull's pasture was the special sanctuary of the god.
In the mild climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the lives of Jewish families took place outdoors.
The women used to eat in the courtyard; the shops were just open benches facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very precious.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. The Nordic sagas say that Erik the Red had been exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Not under its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though each nation was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences among the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you might think there is a treasure map painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Not everything, is true. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the declaration of independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4th, 1776." The text appears on the bottom of the document.
Even if nobody knows for sure who wrote them, it is known that at the beginning of its life, the large parchment of the document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) had been put together to be put away.
So, it is likely that the note was added just for labeling purposes.
The landing in Normandy and the subsequent battles had liberated the North of France, but the South was not yet free.
It was governed by the French of "Vichy." These were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated Southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large enough group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word civiltât derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city-state, and that in some way also defines the dimension of a society.
The city-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the passage of knowledge across different generations, a cultural imprint that persists, and an equitable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving obvious historical signs and cannot be recognized as actual civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with the Congress as the sole component - under the articles of the confederation.
The congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the state authorities, which were later not very cooperative in enforcing all its laws.
Nor did it have any authority to prevail over fiscal laws and tariffs among the states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be sent, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most victorious team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
The most popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the chain/group of islands that Japan has, from a geographical point of view, Japan is often called an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan started in the fifteenth century when European sailors passing by there recorded the name of the islands as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established its base in the southwest of Taiwan, beginning a transformation in the native practices of grain production and employing Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western part of Taiwan and its northern territories and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues still today.
For example, the most common format of still image photographs in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced nowadays, but more importantly, it has been inherited from the formats of digital image sensors.
The 35 mm format is somewhat inaccurate, as it is actually 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the ratio more easily in whole numbers) is therefore called 3:2.
Some common formats (like the APS format family, for example) are related to this report or go quite well together.
The rule of thirds, often used and frequently ridiculed, is a simple directive that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It is established that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
There was a time during this period of European history when the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound the states of Europe together despite their differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power influenced everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources must be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led to many questions about whether this principle was respected.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom launched a naval embargo against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this embargo violated international law generally accepted and codified in a number of international agreements from the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom moved international waters to prevent any ship from entering certain sections of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Since there had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Since the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during the time of the First World War, the nations desired to protect themselves from these situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; every phase of China or every ruling family was a characteristic dynasty.
With more, within each dynasty, and the next one was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin.
In those times there were several disputes among a series of nobles who were fighting for the throne.
That of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
With more options, after the revolution, the occupations were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
That same thing applies to the military because the military rankings, instead of being based on class, were now based on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other nations to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond the life of this world. He used to frequent a cave known as "Hira" on the "Noor" (light) mountain to meditate.
The same banner, which has survived over time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Placed on the crest of one of the mountains north of Meche, the thief is completely isolated from the rest of the mountain.
On the run, it is not easy even to find him, especially if one knows he exists. Once inside the lair, it is complete isolation.
There is nothing to be seen that is not the beautiful clear sky above and all the mountains that surround it. One can see or hear very little of the world inside this cavern.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the great pyramid is part of the many grand pyramid structures made to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains many pyramids (and the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor the women and family members of Khufu.
The symbol of the "upward arc" looks like a V and the "downward arc symbol" resembles a horseshoe or a square without the bottom part.
Up means that one must begin at the bridge and push the bow, down means that one must begin at the frog (which is where the hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An "up bow" usually creates a softer sound, while a "down bow" is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to mark your signs with a pencil, but note that the symbols to cross the bar lines are printed there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrified, Queen Marie Antoinette and their young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and the king’s sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles by a throng of market women.
On a carriage they returned back to Paris, surrounded by a throng of people who shouted and voiced threats against the king and queen.
The children forced the king and the queen to open wide the carriage's windows.
At a certain point, one of the kids smashed the head of one of the royal guards struck down at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of wars for imperialism by the United States in the conquests of the Philippines are paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obliged to pay the taxes to the American colonialist regime to support a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds was changed in the name of the Philippine government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Clearly the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The High Middle Ages is when events unfold and it is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (1000–1300 A.D.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a range of ideas, from technological impetus or technological imperative to a narrower sense where the fate of humans is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows an independent path regardless of cultural and political influences, and that technology has effects on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, one can say that the car necessarily leads to road development.
In any case, a national road network is not economically accessible only to a few cars, therefore new production methods are developed to reduce costs for those who want to be car owners.
The mass motorization also leads to more road incidents, a fact that leads to the development of new medical techniques to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, as seen in writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures emerged that were connected with that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than the arbitrary laws imposed.
Just as Paris, which today is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renown as a center of culture began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders returned bringing back goods such as silks and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets were offering.
It was in that period that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the twelfth-thirteenth century and the fourteenth century.
At the beginning, the clothing was very much influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
In all cases, due to the slowness of the communication channels, those living in the West could remain behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is a type of agriculture carried on to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses traditional seeds local to the ecological region combined with crop rotation or other fairly simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most of the peasants were employed in subsistence agriculture, and it is still like this in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mindsets who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive based on the age, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signify their belonging with the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is that of taking advantage of the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized by the adults around them during their upbringing.
These children were called "feral" or wild. Some wild children were kept locked up (usually by their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child resulted from the parents' refusal due to a child with a severe physical or intellectual disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe childhood abuses or traumas before being abandoned or running away.
Others think that they were raised by animals; someone says that he lived wild on his own.
When they are entirely raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors almost entirely similar (within physical limits) to those of the particular animal that has cared for them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding but it can also be the little paperclip from Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to ask questions, prompt, and explain the procedures that may be too difficult to manage for the caregiver alone.
The children are put into care for a variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment and abuse to even exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not caring, affectionate, and nurturing, but it happens.
We perceive the foster system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide secure homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The placement is intended to provide for all the needs that are lacking in the home where the children have been taken from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet have brought an additional dimension to the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for the use of the internet (James and others, 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to internet sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, movements of the face that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is maintained that one can perceive if a person is telling lies by correctly interpreting the micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," indicated that people who are unable to understand a speech due to brain damage can accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic varieties and selection removes them from the set of visible variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate back and forth the variety between the two sets with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet the demand for amino acids with the available plant resources.
With more of them, the failure in action brings serious consequences: slowing of growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The plant resources most easily accessible would be the proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
Instead, eating animals (ants, termites, eggs), not only is it easy to digest, but it provides a large quantity of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Considering all things, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" more or less in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of waking up earlier than the normal period of sleep and going back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a fairly gentle alarm that brings you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself needing to reset the alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, forcing oneself to wake up to urinate.
The amount of peace that a person has inside is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and in the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the present vital force. Every person has the potential to find total peace and balance.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that prevents reaching the goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they have been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and a variety of Indian yoga techniques.
In the beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and paths of love that embrace everything.
With kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of divinity. With the visualization of a variety of divinities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, resulting in cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to disagreements between those nations.
After two years since the end of the war, the allies of the past were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It would have lasted for the following 40 years and would have been fought earnestly, by proxy armies, on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
All these plans had been rendered almost completely obsolete when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union had entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is one of the most efficient ways to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
By tradition, the work of the mariners was to ensure that their own nation maintained the capacity to move people and goods, and at the same time, to interfere with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly U-boats, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have succeeded in conquering the United Kingdom as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that grazed in the hills or other pasture areas, often tended by goat herders who were often boys or young men, in a manner similar to the better-known shepherds of sheep. These methods of leading the animals to pasture are still used today.
The holidays for the dear ones were established in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the railways for the carts consisted only of parallel wooden beams, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and carry loads larger than those of the slightly rougher roads of that time.
The crossbars were introduced very early on to keep the tracks in their place. Little by little, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had iron strips on top.
This became a common practice, but the smith would take advantage of more wooden wheels from the carts.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with those made of iron. In 1767, the first all-iron wheel rim was introduced.
The first known means of transport is walking; humans began walking about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright habitually.
The bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
You can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join environmental movements, and also become activists to partly reduce future suffering.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in a variety of cases. In any case, if one does not want just a provisional solution, then one should find the root of the problems and should deactivate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly thanks to the scientific and technological developments of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by the congress on July 4, a handwritten print signed by the president of the congress, John Hancock, and the secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few isolated distances to the printing houses of John Dunlap.
The night before last, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on the 8th of July.
One was sent, on the 6th of July, to George Washington who read it to his troops in New York on the 9th of July. A copy arrived in London on the 10th of August.
The 25 Dunlap flyers that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Some paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Some people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have wings with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two legs behind like a T-Rex.
In practice, all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately visible. The symptoms, like vomiting, are quite generic to not allow making an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open medicine container or household chemical products that are toxic.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "pudiese" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is based on an ancient familiarity with lice, which are insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
The house sparrow occupies the niches of the roofs and the ledges of the nests; it is a bird of the nest, adapted to live in the nest or in the host's dwelling.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to discover how the world works through scientific methods. This method in fact guides most of the scientific research.
It is not by itself, however, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, as well as to ask questions and make observations, that scientific research advances.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.

With the decline of the knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from the Greek sources of philosophy and science.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in the majority of living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that carry on a cycle period of free running even without external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments marking the DNA in bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur.
The mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells were germline cells.
Only the mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to the offspring, while the mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities in the field include hiking, fishing, photographing, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn something about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural villages by car to go to their workplaces and cross paths with those whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this context of transport dynamics, everyone in some way supports and is connected with a transport system based on private automobiles.
Science now indicates that this large-scale carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed nations, such levels of complaints concerning the quality of water or bridges collapsing are rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems generate these complaints, why do they break down every other day? Are the transportation engineers really incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of cars and single vehicles between two points and the interaction they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, cars tend to behave within a reasonably constant spectrum; thus, traffic currents tend to have a certain constancy and can be represented in a somewhat mathematical way.
To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships have been established among three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships aid the planning, design, and management of road infrastructures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly has helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This results from a greater choice of smaller spaces where to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Somebody thought that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even those other stars).
This seems sensible, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with stretches that reach six miles in width.
A full 20 percent of the water that drains from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in terms of size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were thousands of years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent nation in the world and the nation with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the language used by most of those who work in the state, where Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as these can be discovered in nature in native forms and are easy enough to extract with primitive methods.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made from a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he had also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Clearly, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys that contain small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it first came out.
It's a pity that, since new writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a minor position and use.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens without ever having to approach a pencil.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus containing a number of protons and neutrons.
More or less like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus once more releases part of that energy at that moment.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, and this means that they tend to split with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the closer side and 100 km thick on the farther side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the plateaus.
There could be more seas on the closest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come up toward the surface.
Theories of content are focused on finding what excites or pleases people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized during their maturation into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them desire the things they want and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Speaking in general terms, two behaviors can arise when bosses start to express their thoughts all at once. On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This kind of administrator has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the group was doing and make it his or her own.
Ultimately, the leader is essentially responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior often results in clashes between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are treated with the same level of excellence as conventional groups, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the virtual group function especially as a contact bridge for their immediate physical group.
Then they have more autonomy than the members of the conventional group since their group can meet according to various time zones that might not be understood by the local management.
Also, the presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the management group that every member reports to. The invisible group establishes the criteria for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to create a learning organization? An objective of putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently used in all operating departments of an organization, creativity and insight can be revealed.
As a result, the process of an organization that works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the clients.
Before an organization can be innovative, the management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous methodologies as methods used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. They therefore narrow the areas of research and make them more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and cancers affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The birth of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Even if AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important field of computer science, which manages intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines for automatic functions that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and clients' questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and gesture recognition.
These areas have become separate disciplines, which focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is widely used in today's world in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into many home computers and software applications for video games.
The trips are an important part of every class. Often a teacher would greatly enjoy taking their students to places where the bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers a solution with virtual visits. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while they are seated in class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online as diaries.
Blogs can also improve the writing of students. Usually, students start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since the students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to commit to improving the writing and avoiding criticism.
With more, writing a blog "obliges students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to stimulate public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and pushes students to expand their learning well beyond traditional school days.
A suitable use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions within the context of other people's writings as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital city of Canada and offers a range of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north is the homeland of natural beauty in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and others as well highlight Ontario as what's considered quintessentially Canadian by foreigners.
Larger areas further to the north are generally sparsely populated and some are wild nature and almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison of populations that surprises quite a few people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right when referring to wild fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or connected with France, and famous as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it was very well received in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route around the Cape of Europe to India.
In the North, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the South and West by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that any traveler says they are married, regardless of their true marital status.
He also considers having a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment and it is not unusual to be followed, taken by the arm, and led on.
You must be firm in refusing men, and do not be afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century AD, and it was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese had destroyed it and rebuilt it with the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt it as Dār al-Bayda and the name Casablanca was given by the Spanish merchants who had established their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a lot of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was hit by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets, especially in the city center.
Even though Goma is quite secure, for all visits outside Goma, an investigation is necessary to understand the conflict situation ongoing in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the most affordable itineraries for seeing mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) fare is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, even if its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of desert encroachment.
It was one of the longest pauses ever from the PBS special Africa's Wonders by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the nation's cities because it has a style more Arabian than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the Northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the East, Zimbabwe to the North, and to the South, the border is marked by the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a diverse wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a diamond bridge of the national parks of South Africa. (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation fees and the entrance into the park.
It could be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either a selection of South African parks or to all the national parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The row of buildings that creates Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a bar chart that gleams, highlighting the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is concentrated on land reclaimed along its northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers appropriated, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove coastal region in the world, extending for 80 km (50 miles) of coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not only mangrove swamps: they include a few of the last arboreal areas of the immense jungle that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one third is covered by water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans is a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that currently there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (beyond the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading towards East and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the inter-district buses are often full, it is better to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are convenient and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means for traveling to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and it has two tracks, each 3.50 meters wide.
The free vertical space below the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational by September 2017, when the posts for the Brazilian customs controls should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of Chaco was the territory of other indigenous tribal groups like the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived with hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born, first called "The Giant Province of the Indies", as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization that continued for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its character and indigenous identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in the world of polo.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can also see small tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), its value is set as equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
The currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley on the other side of the West Store of FIC.
The British pound in general is accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outermost islands, credit cards probably will not be accepted, even though it is possible to receive English and American currencies; check with the owners first to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be insidiously cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the air and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Even though some of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is always wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, one must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
It does not matter how many predators there are, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors get hurt because they have not respected the adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
With rain, be careful as scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying around or cooking strongly smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sent under, with the exception of a single English cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the shooting of the sovereign leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a lot of beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of Cueste Nord (in the district of North Harbour) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
There are almost all swimming spots where the swimming is safe and most of them have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are places for families, sometimes full of people, with a good variety of shops along this. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number one', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are a lot of French wines to try, but New Zealand wines and the Australian ones travel better.
The local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are apprehensive.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso', the cappuccino comes full of milk foam (no mist), and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate waffles are at the Belgian level. The apple strudels are expensive but excellent.
Some trips to the coral barrier are made throughout the year, and accidents for one of these reasons on the coral barrier are rare.
With all that, listen to the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs and pay attention to the safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear close to beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can also be found sporadically outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but it is rare that they attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the mental peace of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through a travel agent it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also block the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any modifications or requests, however, must first go through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For other festivals, most of those who participate in the music festivals decide to camp on site, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive quite early to find a spot where you can enjoy the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage may have ended, there can be other sections of the festival that will continue playing music until late at night.
Some holidays have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in Winter, check the position of the cabin, because crossing the ice can cause quite an awful sound for the more sensitive ones.
The cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. The cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement of a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos usually put in a lot of effort to maximize the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are typically absent, and exits are difficult to find.
Usually they have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them in the place.
Some establishments offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. In any case, being drunk impairs judgment, and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
All those who want to travel to high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below zero.
On the roads with ice and snow, the friction is low and you cannot brake as you do on dry asphalt.
Transforming snowflakes into snowfall in a short time and then enough snow can fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited due to snow blowing or drifting, or due to condensation or ice on the vehicle’s windows.
Otherwise, the conditions of ice and snow are normal in several areas of the region, and traffic continues almost without interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps what attracts the most tourists in Africa and are the most important activity for many visitors.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to the journey through the lands to see the magnificent wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the authorized companies allow a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "walk in the woods," "hike," or "on foot") consists of excursions, both of a few hours and of several days.
The Paralympics will be from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other places around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies are varied, but starting at the end of March most of the cancellation policies for the coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that tickets for the majority of events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and the average ticket price will be around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for borrowing, even if they are not present in the room.
If a rack is not available, or if you do not like to put on pressed pants, then you can use a coat hanger, if it is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (because it may shrink, or in extreme cases burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling the water for one minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters will work for effectiveness, and if you are concerned, it is better to consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are not familiar to them in their regions of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, they can cause an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infections.
The same infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force, are usually not classified as parasites.
Buying duty-free is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and levies in certain locations.
Travelers headed to nations with high taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section that extends between Point Marion and Fairmont currently presents the most demanding void conditions of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on countryside roads, watch out: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The indicated speed limits are much lower than in the sections before and after, usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h), and adhering to them strictly here is even more important than in other circumstances.
Curiously, the cell phone service is stronger here than in many other parts of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rather rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
The desserts with apples are common, with cooked apples in desserts all year round, and cherries and apricots that begin to be seen again in the summer.
Some kinds of baked goods by Germans also have almonds, walnuts, and other dried fruits inside. Often the famous cakes go very well with a strong coffee.
If you want a small but full sweet, try what is called a berlinês, pfannkuchen, or crofe, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in Southern India and in some other regions of the subcontinent, they usually use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
But, if used without an additional qualification, the term tends to mean that the food is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The cuisine of Zave, now easily available throughout the archipelago, presents a range of dishes cooked simply, with the predominant flavors preferred by the inhabitants of Zave being basil, chili pepper, sugar (particularly Zave's coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the riders' feet that hang down the two sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can cause safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in one of them.
If a rider falls from a horse, but has a foot trapped in a stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize the risk, safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders put on riding boots with a heel and a smooth and rather tight sole.
Afterwards, some seats, particularly the English ones, have safety bars that allow the seat to be folded if it is pulled back by a rider who is riding.
The Cochamó Valley: the prime destination for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The climbers capture breathtaking panoramic views at the summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly marking new routes thanks to the infinite potential of their walls.
Winter sports downhill, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down slopes on snow-covered terrain with skis or with a board attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity of excursions for many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski fanatics", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is a very old one: the drawings in the caves depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 in Australia the Norwegians opened the first amateur ski club.
Ski touring: this activity is also called ski mountaineering, skiing or ski touring.
He is a colleague, but he does not always fit into the style of mountaineering or alpinism, these last ones done on steep terrains demand more rigorous requirements.
Think of the ski course as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover longer distances than with walking, but only with a lot of training will you achieve the speed of cross-country running without a heavy backpack on light trails.
Europe is a continent that is rather small, but it contains a lot of independent nations. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many different nations would mean having to apply for visas and having your passport checked many times.
The Schengen area, however, functions in some ways like a nation in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, usually you can cross the borders without having to pass again through passport checks.
Similarly, if one has a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for a visa for each individual member nation of Schengen separately, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no universal definition that tells when industrial products are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as objects over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques even if they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
The reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even within tradition, though, not all of the Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, and other means, keeping reindeer more as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the region of the Sami.
Even though it is used frequently, particularly among non-Roma, the word "zingar" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and the misunderstood perception of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also want to consult the advisories of governments other than your own, but their advisories are intended for their citizens.
For example, the American citizens in the Middle East can face different situations from the Europeans or the Arabs.
The warnings are just a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The visions presented are often superficial, generic, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available from other sources.
Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human lives.
Bad weather can occur everywhere in the world, and there are different types of bad weather, which can depend on geography, topology, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, storms, excessive precipitation, and fires are forms and effects of bad weather, as well as thunderstorms, hailstorms, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal bad weather phenomena include snowstorms, snow gales, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be very attentive to any risk of bad weather in their area as it could affect their travel plans.
All those who plan to visit a nation that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the internet for 'Courses for a hostile environment' is likely to provide the contact details of a local company.
A course usually will cover all the problems faced here with a lot of details in addition, usually with practical experiences.
A typical course will last 2-5 days and will include role-playing games, some basic first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in wild areas are common, but publications that deal with war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they bring valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the undeclared gender (X) or with documents renewed to correspond to the desired name and gender is varying.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is also quite variable.
Even the security checks in airports have become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transsexual individuals before surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The currents of return are the flow of waves that break on the beach, often against coral reefs or similar.
Because of underwater topography, the flow of currents is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current can form in deep waters.
Most drownings occur as a result of trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the current, swimming to shore is no more difficult than normal.
Try to look where you don't get caught again or, depending on your abilities or if you are injured, you might want to wait for help.
The shock of returning comes before the cultural shock (it is not a honeymoon phase), it lasts longer and can be more overwhelming.
Travelers who have had no trouble adapting to the new culture can find a lot of difficulties in readjusting to their native culture.
When one returns home after having lived abroad, they have adapted to the new culture and have lost some customs of their native culture.
When they went abroad for the first time, it's likely that people had patience and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need time to adapt.
People cannot even imagine that the convent has patience and understanding even with travelers who return home.
The light and sound show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in the silence before the show begins.
Usually you can always hear the noise of tourists and merchants. The story of sounds and lights is really like a book of fables.
The Sphinx weaves scenarios and tells a long story.
The writings are displayed on the different pyramids that are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and are the islands with the most bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, which hosts the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands are Livingston and Deception, where the submerged caldera of a still active volcano has become a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region to the South of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau and then rise again forming the Ellsworth Mountains range, 360 kilometers long and cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern range, also called Sentinel Range, hosts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif with Mount Vinson standing at 4892 meters.
In the most remote areas, not covered by cellular network, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone in general is not a replacement for a cell phone since you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite's side in order to make a call.
The service is usually used by ships, taking cargo boats as well as shipments that need stable and fast connections in remote ports.
The local telecommunications service provider should be able to give more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option among those who want to take a gap year after school is to travel and study.
This solution is greatly appreciated by those who have finished high school and want to take a year off before going to university without compromising their education.
Many times, taking a year of courses abroad can truly improve the chances of being admitted to a university once you return home.
Usually a university fee must be paid to enroll in these study programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos of this.
Between archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is not necessarily needed.
It is not that these archipelagos and the larger lakes are truly large enough for any yacht; smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This seems like Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it remains rather unique (for example, in the Basque Country, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises stop for quite a while in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Therefore, you can visit the historic city for a couple of whole days and at night return to sleep on the boat.
If you disembark only for cruise excursions, you do not need an additional visa (starting from 2009).
Some cruises are shown in brochures for Berlin, in Germany. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is quite far from the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if one has never been on a plane before or has had a traumatic experience.
Nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears or aversions to other things that many people have.
For someone, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown and the lack of control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver items quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or parts for urgent repairs.
For some routes, the larger companies have their own airplanes, but for other routes and for smaller companies, it was a problem.
If they shipped things by plane, for certain routes they could arrive ten days before the items were unloaded and went through customs.
The only way to make it arrive faster was to send the goods as passenger baggage. The airline companies' rules did not allow baggage to travel without a passenger, which was therefore necessary.
The clearest way to fly first class or business is to pull out a nice chunk of money for this privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
In any case, this choice will not be cheap: as a general estimate, one can expect to pay a business class ticket four times more than the normal economy fare, and for first class eleven times more!
Speaking generally, it doesn't even make sense to look for deals on first or business class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and they make them pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any United Nations country.
The economic ties have been restored between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most practiced religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and an efficient transportation hub.
Once there was the ancient city of Smyrna, but today it is instead a modern and developed commercial center, which stands around a large bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers intermingle with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, even though the city has an atmosphere more akin to Mediterranean Europe than to Turkish tradition.
The village of Haldarsvík has a view of the island of Eysturoy which is nearby, and it has a church with an unusual octagonal shape.
In the graveyard, there are interesting marble dove sculptures on some tombs.
It's worth spending half an hour to walk through this interesting village.
To the north and a short distance away lies the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, famous abroad thanks to the fervent descriptions of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus often arrives in Sintra and also stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always in the North, you can visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a famous place worldwide for the apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
We must be aware that we are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a place that holds immeasurable significance for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who have survived those times, and even more people who had their loved ones killed or sent to work until they died, Jews and non-Jews alike.
The place must be treated with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. One should never make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazism.
One should never damage the place with engravings or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the people speak better in Catalan, most people understand it, and practically everyone is good at speaking Spanish.
In almost all cases, most of the signs are written only in Catalan because by law it is the first official language.
But Spanish is also used a lot in public transportation and other services.
Ordinary communications on the subway are given only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are communicated via an automatic system in a range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have the reputation of being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even if ultimately this is an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel comfortable in Paris is to behave in the best possible manner, like a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person. This way, getting around the city will be much easier.
The sharp waiting of the Parisians quickly disappears if you show them a bit of kindness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by forests, especially beeches, firs, and spruces, and it presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a wide variety of plant communities, thanks to a range of microclimates, different terrains, and various altitude levels.
The area also hosts a great variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie are found here, along with many other more common species.
When they visit the monasteries, women must wear a skirt that covers their knees and they also have to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide a shawl for women who arrive unprepared, but if one brings their own, especially if it has bright colors, the monk or friar at the entrance will smile in amusement.
On the same line, men also need to wear trousers that cover their knees.
Also these can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but these clothes are not washed after each use, therefore they might be unpleasant to put on. The size for men is unique!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of other similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, meat (especially pork) and frequently uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any other available topping such as cheese, tuna, and so on.
All nouns, as well as the courtesy pronoun "Sie", start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish certain verbs from objects.
Perhaps this makes reading easier, whereas writing is a bit more complicated because one has to understand if a verb or an adjective is used in a noun form.
The Italian pronunciation is quite easy, since most of the words are pronounced as they are written.
One must pay attention especially to the letters C and G, because their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
One must also be careful to pronounce r and rr in different ways: "caro" means "dear", whereas "carro" means "cart".
The Persian language has a rather simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help to better learn Persian grammar and to better understand the sentences.
It is logical that if one knows a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
In any case, people who know a bit of Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore there is no need to study it independently.
Nowadays, pre-modern astronomical observatories are outdated and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not the problem it is today, these are found in cities or on university campuses, thus in more accessible places compared to those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Enjoying the blooming of cherry trees, called "hanami," has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where the chosen flower was that of the osmanthus.
In Japan, the first celebrations for the cherry blossom were organized by the emperor, named after him and other members of the aristocracy who attended the imperial court.
Plants show themselves best in their natural environment, so one must resist the temptation to take even “just one” specimen.
When visiting formal gardens, one cannot pick the specimens, under penalty of immediate expulsion without the possibility of discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe city, easy to get around, and where once you arrive you can buy almost everything.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator, it always has to bear the cold front and the glare of the sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses that go north towards Hebron, a traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Better to check that the bus you want to take goes all the way to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Internal waterways can be a good idea for organizing a vacation.
For example, you could visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise along the Danube through interesting cities or along the Erie Canal.
They also mark routes for popular walks to be done on foot or by bicycle.
Christmas is one of the most important solemnities of Christianity, when the birth of Jesus is celebrated.
Many of the traditions that accompany this celebration have also been adopted by non-believers, both in Christian countries and in non-Christian ones all over the world.
Tradition wants that one spends the night of Easter awake somewhere outside to see the crack of dawn.

The most traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with assemblies that at the stroke of midnight start celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands traveled here by swimming, flying, or crawling.
Due to the long distance from the continent, the mammals were not able to undertake that journey, and the giant land tortoises became the Galapagos' main herbivores.
When man arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals were introduced such as goats, horses, cows, donkeys, cats, and dogs.
Visiting the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you can see the polar night, that is when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be dark all day long.
Since the population of these regions is not very large and therefore light pollution is not a problem, one can enjoy the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal compared to Western practices.
The outfit is the standard clothing for going to work and colleagues address each other by surname or by job title.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental, and teamwork is more important than individual results.
Often the workers must have permission from their superiors before making a decision and must comply with the directives of their superiors without discussions.
