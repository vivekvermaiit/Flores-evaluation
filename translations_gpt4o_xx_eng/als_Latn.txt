This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but provides details that cannot usually be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional presentation.
According to scientists, on the upper part, this animal had feathers of a chestnut brown color and, on the lower part, feathers with a pale or carotenoid color.
This discovery also gives us an idea about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed central shaft, which is called a "rachis", but share other characteristics with modern feather structures, such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis might be a later evolutionary development than these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers believe that the example shows an adult feather, not a bird's feather, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur.
The researchers thought that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult feather and not a chick's small feather.

They discovered that the functioning of the Sun is based on the same fundamental principles as other stars. The conclusions showed that activity in all stars of the system was guided by their illumination and rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the value of the Rossby number (Ro), the less active the star is in the reversal of its magnetic field polarity.

The completed work was more theoretical even though the program was designed to simulate the observations carried out on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists reached the conclusion that dark matter has an influence on other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a halo form and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He stated in an interview that the new variant was "very concerning and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, - thinks Dr. Molli, - and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
Within a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people affected by tuberculosis still seems to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given moment in South Africa.

The government has also promised several million vials of the anti-encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for the following year.
Plans for distributing vaccines in historically affected areas were delayed this year due to a lack of funding and because they were given less priority compared to other diseases.

They are cooler than their surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure that there are no envelopes in them before the voting begins and that no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives as witnesses to any part of the process. Votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict supervision, implementing the appropriate procedures.

The bill requires that violent video games sold in the state of California be labeled with a label that reads "18" and brings a penalty of selling them to minors with a fine of $1,000 for each violation.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning saying that Huhne and Pryce were charged.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take on the role of Minister of Trade that will be vacated by Davey.
Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims were Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old, and Nicholas Alden, 25 years old. Cuddeback had been the driver of the car.
Edgar Veguilla was wounded in the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider sustained injuries that required surgery for the reconstruction of his face.
Uka's weapon jammed when he pointed it at the fifth person's head. Schneider has continuous pain, is blinded in one eye, is missing a part of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Shneider testified via a video link from a U.S. military base in his homeland.
Besides Wednesday's activity, Carpanedo also competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first was the slalom, where she received a "Did Not Finish" on her first attempt. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In her next race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting category, with a combined walk time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Austrian Klaudia Lösch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Giongi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers in the sitting skiing category did not finish their race, and 45 out of 117 total skiers in the Alpine Skiing World Championship did not manage to rank in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, D K Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss national and have found her cell phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Inspector of Police Chandra Shekar Solanki said that the accused arrived in court with covered faces.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed, while emergency services freed the driver from the red "Audi TT".
He was initially admitted to the "James Paget" hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoja has been accused of killing her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and the commencement of the trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be tainted because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts have considered publishing photographs as potentially prejudicial to the case.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee emphasizes that "it seems journalists tread on a dangerous path if they publish the photographs, etc., of suspected individuals."
The Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for all criminal prosecutions, has told reporters that there will be no further comments at least until the indictment is announced.
According to the information, the document will refer to the opposition of the borders that Palestine wants according to the borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
It is believed that other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Until the signing of this agreement, Israel seeks to have a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian authorities agree to allow their presence for only five years.
The shooters had to be closely supervised by the guards during the additional pest control trial, as the trial was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters’ Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters’ Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director for Park Protection and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have been given extensive instructions for their safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council for Martel in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Interim Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the non-holding of elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning overheating iPods have been reported, causing six fires in total and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it had been informed about 27 accidents related to the equipment.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced last week that "Apple" had informed them of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious".
The ministry reacted by describing the postponement of the report by Apple as "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (on Friday at 09:19 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time).
The Office of Emergency Management of Northern Mariana expressed that no damages were reported at the scene.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she had to go to the bathroom. They accidentally shot with a gun.
Liginsi followed his father's example and began a career in medicine.
He was educated as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working in the hospital, Liginsi began to research preterm birth in his free time.
His research showed that, if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the lungs of the fetus in babies.
"Xinhua" reported that state investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by her wrestling colleagues.
Tomi Drimer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night with two moons. Quite rare, like herself. A strong woman."
Dastin "Goldast" Ranels commented that: "Luna was as strange as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
In a survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, opponents of Australia's return to a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that she believed the state of Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the individuals in the survey share this opinion, according to which they wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the extreme responses of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal had to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition has not been secure.
He has been unable to obtain the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as they are prohibited by the Games.
Kurtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime number to date.
The discovery was verified by many people using different devices and software at the beginning of February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have been a source of sending water to the earth, along with organic compounds that can create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially how Earth was created from the collision of comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA's claims, will allow airplanes to travel on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite technology, compared to the old technology which was based on ground radars, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate the aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transportation vehicles will be provided and the overground trains will not stop at "Wembley", and the car parking facilities, as well as the park and ride, are not available for the playing field.
The fear of the lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought this process would take longer due to the interbreeding between a Darwin's endemic finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be laminated into fine forms.
It can be drawn out and become a thin wire, which can then be twisted and woven. It can be hammered into sheets or laminated into thin layers.
It can be made extremely thin and combined with other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to adorn images painted by hand in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidic or basic (alkaline) level of the chemical.
The pH level is evidenced by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one electron and one proton).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze them to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in nearly every dwelling, connected to a rather intricate sewage system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remnants of sewage systems have been found.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets, in Roman civilization, were sometimes part of mixed public baths for men and women.
When you make a phone call with someone thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has brought us is that it has provided us with a much faster and much easier means of transport.
She has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are cats larger than average that feed on prey of average size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In conclusion, there are many small cats (including house cats that roam freely) that eat a lot more small animals like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a cozy corner, a special function that every cat has that does not allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines. They live in large groups called prides.
The groups are composed of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and pups.
Women, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters, generally have closer relationships with each other.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals with behavior surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not with that of other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
As a fairly prepared athlete, a tiger can climb (although not as well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with the strength of five strong people.
The tiger is in a group (the genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but is more akin to a sentence with words of growls and shouts.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals. When they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller in size than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals (their prey) through scent, by smelling where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and move very stealthily too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the surrounding environment and then jumping onto their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they have come (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than a previously necessary competitor.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins adapting to its new environment, it starts to appear less and less similar to the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is a very important part and an inevitable consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide that people emit (that is, emit through respiration).
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and create our clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of its era, so it was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, meaning that nothing crossing his path could escape him.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had his tongue like a fork. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he might have even been a cannibal.
He would also attack anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex could not defeat it.
Although we would recognize most of their foods, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual items for celebrations, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to dine together at feasts, where they ate their meals reclining on their sides.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They, for example, had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and indeed, there is no ancient Roman who ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods which was called the house of the lord.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to attend to the gods' needs through celebrations and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes as integral parts of the temples, special towers in the form of pyramids were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
The apartment was not of much importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Life in the Jewish family mainly took place outdoors.
Women cooked the meals in the yard; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, therefore timber was extraordinarily expensive.
Greenland had few settlements. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, in his travels westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, the Eskimo tribes already lived there during that period despite his discovery.
Although each state was "Scandinavian," among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland there were many differences.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that behind the Declaration of Independence there was a treasure map written.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence was written "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of this document, written upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be preserved.
For this reason, it is possible that the note was placed only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south remained occupied.
He was governed by the French of the Vichy regime. They were French who, in 1940, had chosen to make peace with the Germans and had collaborated with the occupiers, instead of fighting against them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free France forces had liberated Southern France and were continuing towards Germany.
Civilization is called a unique and shared culture of a rather large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis" which means "civil", which is related to the Latin word "civis" meaning "citizen" and "civitas" meaning "city" or "city-state", which in a certain way also determines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of states. A civilizing culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a continuous cultural trace, and a fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies first created a weak central government - with Congress as its only structure - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all of its laws.
Furthermore, he did not have the authority to violate the laws on taxes and fees between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and, in 2006, were the FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, starting with Italians competing in both international games and Olympic activities.
Japan consists of almost 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the grouping/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical sense, as an "archipelago".
The origin of Taiwan began long ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island".
The Dutch East India Company established a base in Southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of local grain production practices and employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas in the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In the year 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed it until the year 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976 and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format of still photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
It continues to be produced even today and above all, in the same format inherited from the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35 mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, 36 mm in width by 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to simplify the ratio to whole numbers) comes out as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often mocked, is a simple guiding line that creates dynamism by maintaining a degree of order in an image.
He determines that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, was viewed with an investigative eye.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith had linked European states with each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His power, which was felt everywhere, touched everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money funds are specifically there for that reason.
The main organs of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being implemented.
Immediately after the start of military hostilities, Britain initiated the naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was proven to be effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent the entry of all ships into entire parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was minimal, Germany hoped for a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine warfare.
The prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations during the 1920s were pacifism and isolationism.
After the horrors and atrocities during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid the repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the "Edison" company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with only 4 cents in his account, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time; each era or ruling family of China was known as a dynasty.
Likewise, between each of the dynasties, there was an unstable period with divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place among many nobles, who were fighting for the throne.
"The Three Kingdoms" was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, during which thousands of people died in the struggle to occupy the highest position in the grand palace in Xian.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, job positions also opened up for all male applicants, enabling success for the most ambitious and successful ones.
This also applies to the military because instead of military ranks being based on categories, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was most interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He often went to meditate in a cave that began to be known as "Hira" in the "Nur" (light) Mountain.

This cave, which is located at the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy at all to find it, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can't see anything but the clear and beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains surrounding you. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still survives today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures constructed in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Khufu), some small tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper arc" sign looks like a V and the "lower arc" sign looks like a paperclip or a square without the bottom edge.
"The upper" means that you should start at the top and push the bow, and "the lower" means that you should start at the ring (which is where the hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a sweeter sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more firm.
You can keep your notes, but remember that the printed curved signs are there for musical purposes, so they usually need to be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrified, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6th, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage completely open.
In an instant, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of the American imperialist war to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino population themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a significant portion of expenses, and the interest on the bonds was traded on the stock market in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Certainly, the super profits obtained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main profits of American imperialism.
Someone must understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the order to understand the Templars.
The era during which the events occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (years 1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from technological impetus or the necessity of technology to the narrow understanding that human fate is guided by a fundamental logic related to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two main common ideas: that the development of technology progresses on its own path beyond cultural or political influence and that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on societies that are natural, unconditioned by social factors.
Someone might say, for example, that the vehicle necessarily leads to the improvement of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of vehicles, therefore new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of vehicles also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a pronounced element of cultural determinism, brought by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures arose that were connected to that geography, and, since they were in harmony with the state of society, they were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is renowned as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 AD and lasted until around the year 1100 AD.
His position declined during the twelfth century, especially due to the fact that the crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this time, the transfer of the title as the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was also completed.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as a result of slow communication channels, Western styles can remain 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time that came as a result of the crusades was that people began using buttons to fasten clothes.
Existential agriculture is the farming practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existential agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses native seeds combined through crop rotation or with other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield growth.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and the situation continues to remain the same in many developing nations.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel disregarded by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the ethnicity, age, location, class, and/or gender of the members.
The distinguishing criteria of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender-related, geographical, or an intersection of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their membership by using style in a unique and symbolic way, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortunes, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized with adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "wild" or primitive. Some wild children have been isolated from people (usually by their parents); this abandonment of the child was in some cases due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disorder.
Wild children may have been victims of severe child abuse or trauma before abandonment or departure.
For others it is said that they were raised by animals and for some it is said that they lived alone in nature.
When completely educated by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to that of the particular guardian animal, such as their fear or indifference towards people.
While the project-based learning method should make learning easier and more interesting, "Scaffolding" supported learning takes it a step further.
The teaching method through scaffolding is not a learning method, but, on the contrary, it is an auxiliary tool that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience such as: using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, meaning, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the small person in the form of the paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are adopted by software and aim to investigate, stimulate, and explain the procedures that the student might have found difficult to handle alone.
Children are sent to the children's home for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should be raised, under any circumstances, in an environment that is not encouraging, friendly, and educational, but they are being raised this way.
We consider the Custody System as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide loving caregivers, safe homes, secure healthcare, and continuous education.
Custody is supposed to provide all the missing needs from the home where they were previously.
The internet intertwines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal ones.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to other dimensions regarding access for uses and pleasures.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important incentives for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" have also been identified as new aspects related to motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they observed how audiences responded to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in explaining micro-expressions and facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect if a person is lying through the accurate interpretation of their facial expressions.
In his presentation "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks showed how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even believed that such abilities to explain human behavior might also be possessed by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have proven that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection removes it from the group of expressed variants.
Isolation and recombination repeatedly mix variation between the two groups with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid needs through the plant sources of the savanna.
Furthermore, the failure to achieve this has severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant resources that are more easily accessible would be the proteins derived from leaves and legumes, but primates like us find it difficult to digest them if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs), not only are easily digested, but they offer large amounts of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
Taking all things into consideration, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved "their protein problem" somewhat in the same way that chimpanzees do on the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using an alarm clock with a relatively low volume to bring you to your senses without waking you completely.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm while asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed to force someone to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and spirit.
With the reduction of tension, the actual life force increases. Every individual has the opportunity to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was further enriched with the theological thought of the Mahayana's "path of love" and more Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. Through the visual presentation of some deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, bringing about cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes in system, process, and culture led to the discord between the states.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and thus the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years and would truly be fought by authorized armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans fell out of use almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after the occupation of the Eastern Polish regions, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transportation of goods is currently the most efficient way of moving large quantities of goods and people across the ocean.
The task of naval fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemies' ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were attempting to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Simultaneously, the German fleet was trying to stop the traffic primarily using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have managed to conquer Britain, just as had happened with other countries in Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, often under the care of goat herders who were usually children or adolescents, much like the better-known shepherds. These methods of livestock keeping are still used today.
The roads for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and to carry larger loads than on the slightly more difficult roads of that time.
The sleepers were put in quite early to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron sheet on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron consumed more the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first entirely iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; people started walking on foot two million years ago when Homo Erectus appeared (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Adaptations for bipedal walking have been found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live by respecting the environment more, we can participate in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce future suffering.
In many cases, this is akin to treating the symptoms. However, we must find the cause of the problems and deactivate it if we don't want just a temporary solution.
It is very clear that the world has undergone significant changes due to humanity's advances in science and technology, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its approval on July 4 by Congress, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made which are now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done on July 8th by John Nixon in the courtyard of "Independence Hall".
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it on July 9th to his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 pamphlets of Dunlap known to exist so far are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today think that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things regarding birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs with claws and scales, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex dinosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in computer language, these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis can be made.
The presence of an open box of medicine or toxic household chemicals can be the clearest sign of intoxication.
Review the label for special instructions on first aid for that particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term "bug" in its official sense.
This term originates from the old similarity to bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Like assassin bugs, bed bugs are also nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or shelter of their host.
In the entire United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), thus remaining the most significant neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that the likelihood of women having multiple sclerosis is twice as high as for men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can decide on preparing an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights as parents so that another couple can adopt the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method indeed guides most scientific research.
But that is not the only one; scientific study is also guided by experimentation and the experiment is the test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, particularly, on the Bible written in the Latin language.
Aristotle's views were accepted in every scientific matter, including psychological ones.
When the knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself disconnected from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms related to physiology and behavior often depend primarily on the presence of endogenous cycles as well as their production by biological clocks.
For the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, intermittent rhythms have been documented that are not merely reactions to occasional external signals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will maintain a period of cycles with free movement, even when external signals are absent.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the main proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can result in a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations of cells from the germline can be transmitted to children, whereas mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts individuals who are interested in going to natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of field activities include fishing, hunting, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying information related to the ecosystem.
An example is the development of visits, photography, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the towns by car to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth movement of transportation vehicles, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Now science shows that the massive carbon-based economy has caused the biosphere to shift from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard so often.
Why do transport systems cause these dissatisfactions, why do they fail every day? Are the transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic movement is the study of the motion of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a consistent time frame; Therefore, traffic flows can be mathematically approximated.
To better present the flow of traffic, the connections between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This coordination helps in the planning, designing, and use of road facilities.
Among animals, insects were the first to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them to more easily evade their predators and to find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects possess the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the length of their bodies.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
This seems logical, because the Earth does not appear to move, right?
The Amazon River is the second-longest river on Earth and the first in terms of width. It carries 8 times more water than the river that ranks second.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, with a width of six miles in some cases.
About 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the construction of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were much older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in legislation and in its official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since antiquity, people have had knowledge of fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as all these can be found in nature in their original form and extracted relatively easily from mines with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. Those elements were earth, air, water, and fire.
This resembled more closely the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also developed the theory that they transform into new substances to create whatever we see.
Alloys are fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that in the periodic table many elements exist.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Without a doubt, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles, which are called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, with his invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, after the introduction of newer writing methods, the status and uses of the pencil have declined.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to use a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes out.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that the fusion of some protons and neutrons with a nucleus requires energy.
Just like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus from the start releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split either spontaneously or with the slightest provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side of the moon.
It is thinner under the dark maria areas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. The lava found it easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people to make choices or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that they keep within themselves as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes some people desire the things they desire and which things in their environment will push them to do or not do certain things.
Two widespread theories on content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors may emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unusual decisions, to impose disciplinary measures, to conduct performance evaluations, to assign tasks and responsibilities for everyone.
On the other side of the spectrum, such a person easily transforms into someone unrecognizable, who thinks that they must change everything the team has done and take credit for it.
Ultimately, the leader bears the final responsibility for the team's success and failure.
Often, this behavior causes division between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some small differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members since their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administration.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The invisible team" is the management team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating an educational organization? One objective for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all resources available are used effectively across the functional sectors of an organization, creativity and capability can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a renewal process to serve the client's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Consequently, they narrow the field of research and make it much more accurate.
The reciprocal relationship between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their studies.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some functions of the mind.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has taken on strong nuances in science fiction literature, artificial intelligence represents a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI involves creating devices for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have turned into distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence System is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is included in several software applications of personal computers and video games.
Excursions occupy a large part of every teaching methodology. It often happens that a teacher expresses the desire to send her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can visit museum artifacts, view an aquarium, or admire fine arts while staying seated with their class.
Virtual field trip is also an excellent way to think about a journey and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of "Bennet" school in North Carolina create a webpage dedicated to their trip to the capital; this website is modified every year, but the old versions are still preserved online as a block of memories.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins efforts to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more perceptive about the world around them." The need to cater to the interests of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond their traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. Through active responses to online materials, students can determine their positions regarding writings from others, as well as define their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada which has a series of art galleries and museums where the past and present of Canada are showcased.
Further south is the Niagara Falls and the north houses the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All this and much more present Ontario with the elements that are considered by foreigners to be the most typically Canadian.
The large areas located further north are very sparsely populated, and some of them are almost barren and uninhabited regions.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and a separate continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach vacation destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands and it had a great influence on the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
The influence and colonization by Europe began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It helps you even if you put on a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women must understand that cultural differences can cause what they consider harassment and pursuit, grabbing by the arm, etc. is not uncommon.
Be assertive when you refuse men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (just because it's due to cultural changes, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The contemporary city of Casablanca was founded by Imazighen fishermen in the 10th century BC and was utilized by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in the year 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badia and it was called Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as: tagine, ceramic items, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of ornaments, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Niragongo volcano that covered most of the city streets, and particularly the city center.
Although Goma is somewhat safe, you should research every trip outside of Goma to understand the state of ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Niragongo volcano, along with some of the more affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Gomë. The usual (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
In combination with its previous unattainability, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for distant exotic places.
Timbuktu is today an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger in 1990, due to the threat from desert sands.
She was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special broadcast for the Public Broadcasting Service "Wonders of the African World".
The city has a strong contrast with the other cities in this country, because it has more of an Arabic style than an African one.
The "Kruger" National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² divided into 14 different ecozones, in each of which different wild animals live.
He is one of the most important attractions of South Africa and is called the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks in South Africa, the park has daily fees for entrance and maintenance.
You may also benefit from purchasing a "Wild Card", which offers entry to any of South Africa's selection of parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that is considered the main destination by many tourists.
The parade of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering bar graph highlighted by the presence of the waters of "Victoria" harbor.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon pier across the way.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the land appropriated by British colonizers, therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is the suitable place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove strip in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of the Bengal and Indian coastal areas.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest on the Indian side is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just swamps with rhizophores; they encompass some of the last remaining parts of the vast jungles that once covered the valley of Northern India.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², approximately one-third of which is covered with water/marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal royal tigers in the area and about 30,000 deer have also been encountered.
The buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those traveling east and toward Xhakari/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable that tickets be purchased a few days in advance, as it often happens that intercity buses are completely full.
Most of the regions receive services from small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Sharing taxis is a fast and convenient way for travel to nearby places, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and to Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for survival.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaikuru and Pajagua, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called the "Giant Province of the Indies," was created as a result of the confrontation between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish were the ones who started the period of colonization, a period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The largest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For the latest news on the tours and where to buy tickets for the polo matches, go to the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and, within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted too.
On the peripheral islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British and United States currency may be. Consult in advance with the owners to determine which payment method is accepted.
Outside the islands, it is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical regions. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can have a cold that deceives: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the level of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how docile they may appear, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack you.
Every year dozens of visitors get injured because they do not keep the proper distance. These are wild, large animals and possibly dangerous, and for this reason, you should give them the necessary space.
Besides this, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid keeping or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia, founded in the 1850s, has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for a British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful organization in the city led to the killing of the main leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because of Auckland's location between two ports. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches and safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of "Tamaki" road are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the elegant outskirts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches sometimes overcrowded with people, with a multitude of shops lined up near the shore. You can swim safely.
The main beer in the country is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and pleasant. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be found more easily.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is something foreign. A short black coffee is "espresso," cappuccino is served covered in cream (and not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but wonderful.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef, and damage to the reef from any of these causes is rare.
But again, respect the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs and pay great attention to the safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of the 1770 bay. Occasionally, they may also appear outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance reassures the traveler that there will be a place to sleep as soon as they reach their destination.
Often, travel agents have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find that it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to secure other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, every change or request must first go through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp in the same place, and most participants consider it an essential part of this experience.
If you want to be near the activity, you will need to go early to find a camping spot near the music.
Do not forget that, even if the music may have ended on the main stages, there might be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until the late hours of the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic during winter, check where your cabin is located, as the movement on ice creates a very dreadful noise for those who are more sensitive.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Typically, windows and clocks are missing, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and within their premises.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. But intoxication weakens judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will drive a vehicle at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account that there may be snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is small, and you cannot drive the vehicle as if you were on a clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, in a very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or wind with snow, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, weather conditions with ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the main element of tourist attraction in Africa and the most special moment for many visitors.
The term safari, in common usage, refers to overland trips to observe the wild and amazing life of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, usually come close to vehicles, and with standard equipment, you will be able to have a better view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you might see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "bush walk", "walking safari", or "walking on foot") consists of a walk on foot, lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, having organized the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for the year 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most of the cancellation policies related to the coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
It is expected that most of the event tickets will be priced from 2500 to 130,000 yen, with typical tickets priced around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to lend you, even if there isn't one in the room.
In case you don't have an iron or if you don't want to keep your socks ironed, you can try using a hairdryer, if there is one.
Be careful not to allow excessive heating of the fabric (which may cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different methods for water purification, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others a few minutes are needed.
Filters have varying effectiveness and, if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that they are not familiar with in the regions where they reside.
Parasites can damage food, cause skin irritations, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are generally not qualified as harmful.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excises in certain countries.
Travelers headed to high-tax states can occasionally save quite a substantial amount of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section of road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often traversing isolated areas of virgin forests.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns prevail.
The marked speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and full compliance with them is even more important than in other circumstances.
Surprisingly, the cell phone service is much stronger here than during other parts of the road, such as in "Pennsylvania Wilds".
German pastries are very good and in Bavaria, they are very diverse and different, just like those of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, starting with those with apples that are made throughout the year and continuing with those with plums that are made in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other dried fruits. Typical types of cake go very well especially with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the ones that, depending on the region, are called berliner, pfannkuchen, or krapfen.
Kerri is a dish based on herbs and spices together with meat or vegetables.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, the term is meant to imply foods originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island of Java when used without other qualifiers.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widely available throughout the archipelago, features a range of simply spiced dishes, where the dominant flavorings favored by the Javanese are: peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and some aromatic spices.
Stirrups are foot supports for the rider that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but they can be a safety issue due to the possibility of riders getting their feet stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse, but their foot is stuck in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse takes off. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most motorcyclists wear boots with heels and soles that are smooth and very narrow.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps that allow the stirrup leather to drop from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with an array of big walls and granite spires.
The peaks include breathtaking views from the ridges. Mountaineers from every corner of the world are constantly trying new routes among its slopes with endless possibilities.
Snow sports in hilly terrain, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a widespread travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes known as "ski nomads," whose sole holiday objective is skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is extremely ancient - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to the 5000s BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first ski training club in Australia.
Skiing with backpacks: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski excursion.
He has connections, but they usually don't include alpine skiing tournaments or mountaineering, the latter of which are developed on steep terrain and require much stronger skis and boots.
Think of the skiing itinerary as a similar walking itinerary.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than walking, but you will very rarely reach the speeds of skiing on terrain without a heavy backpack on cleared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but it has many independent states. Under normal conditions, traveling to many states would require visa applications and multiple passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you do not leave this area, you can usually cross the borders without needing to go through the passport control checkpoints again.
In the same way, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply separately for a visa in each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no general definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition varies geographically, where the age threshold may be lower in countries like North America compared to Europe.
Artisanal products can be called antique, despite being newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many people with other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sámi have been extensively involved in reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, primarily using reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism brings significant income to Sapmi, the Sami area.
Although it is used a lot, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is usually considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If a travel recommendation is issued for the country you are going to, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.

"Severe weather" is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Rough weather can be encountered all over the world, and there are different types of it that can be conditioned by geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The forms and consequences of severe weather include strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.

Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any dangers from severe weather affecting their area, as this may impact their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a place that might be called a war zone should be professionally trained.
With an internet search for "Hostile Environment Course," you might be able to find the address of a local society.
A course will normally address in much more detail all the issues discussed here, generally with practical experience.
A course will be regularly from 2-5 days and will include role-playing, extensive training in first aid, and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the desert are common, but there are few publications that address war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without stating gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.

After September 11, 2001, the security checkpoint controls have become much more bothersome.
Transgender individuals before surgery should not expect to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Coastal currents are the return flow from waves moving away from the shore, often at a reef or something similar.
The underwater topology causes the concentration of the return flow in some deeper parts, and there a rapid current towards the depth of the sea can form.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while attempting to swim backward against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won't be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been seen, perhaps it's best to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock happens faster than culture shock (has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapted easily to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your country after living abroad, you will be accustomed to the new culture and will have lost some of the customs from your own country's culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new place.
People may not expect that for travelers returning home, patience and understanding are also needed.
The light and sound show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
Before the start of the show, you can watch the pyramids in silence and in darkness.
Usually, you always hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The story of the voice and light is precisely like a book of tales.
The Sphinx has been set as the background and storyteller of a long history.
The views appear on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
For the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, there are claims from several nations and there are more bases there, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston and Deception Island, where the water-filled caldera of a still-active volcano offers an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here on the plateau and then reappear to form a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In isolated areas without cellular phone signal, a satellite phone may be your only choice.
The satellite phone cannot generally replace the mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with an unobstructed line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by maritime transportation, including cruise ships, as well as by expeditions that require remote data and voice calls.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to provide additional information regarding the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a sabbatical year is traveling and learning.
This is especially preferred by those who leave school, which allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually increase your chances of entering higher education when you return to your home country.
In general, for enrollment in these educational programs, a tuition fee will be required.
Finland is a very good destination for boating. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on these lakes and archipelagos.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly quite large for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaking offer a different experience.
Boat trips are considered a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but aside from them, it is something quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, this figure is one in forty).
Most specialty cruises in the Baltic have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several full days, while you return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you go to the shore only with boat excursions, you will not need a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruises in their brochures present the German city of Berlin. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea, thus a visit to this city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things that many, many people have.
For some, a certain knowledge of how a plane works and what happens on a flight can help them overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or on not having things under control.
Courier companies are well-paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important for work documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but it was a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If they would send things by air transport, for some itineraries it might take entire days to go through the unloading and customs clearance process.
The only way to pass them faster would be shipping as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow the shipping of baggage without passengers, and here is your role.
The easiest way to fly in first or business class is to gather a large amount of money for this privilege (or, even better, to have the company do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as a general rough rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and eleven times more for first class!
Usually, it's not even worth asking for a price reduction for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain handful of passengers who are willing to pay high prices for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set the prices according to the circumstances.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The native language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
This conflict caused in 1994 the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religious belief in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation center.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it has now been transformed into a bustling, modern, and developed commercial hub, spread across a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Among the wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers, traditional red-tiled roofs are scattered, along with the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere resembles Mediterranean Europe more than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has a peculiar octagonal church.

Do not damage the appearance of the object by making notes or graffiti on these structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are marked only in Catalan, because it has been established by law as the first official language.
However, the Spanish language is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but for unplanned disruptions, announcements are made by an automated system in a multitude of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, harsh, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as possible, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it easier for you to get along.
The harsh exterior of Parisians will quickly soften if you display some basic good manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forests, mainly beech trees, conical pines, and firs, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has an exceptionally large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, diverse soils, and varying elevation levels.
The region is also the habitat of a very large number of animal and bird species.
There, a rare animal world can be found, such as: the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the wild rooster, along with many more common species.
When going to monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who are not prepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored scarf, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
Even these can be borrowed from the spare pants at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these loose trousers. One size fits all for men!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and makes full use of olive oil.
A simple typical dinner of the area, especially during the summer, is "Pa amb Oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any other available ingredient such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns near the word "Sie", which means "you", always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although the writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to discern whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be cautious about are "c" and "g," since their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means cart.
Persian has a grammar that is somewhat simple and generally regular.
For this reason, if you read this practical grammar, you will be able to learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand its expressions better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, you will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is very similar, so it doesn't need to be studied separately.
The observers of the medieval era are nowadays almost out of function and are used as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their days was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, where access is easier than those built in modern times.
Most modern survey telescopes are very large objects in isolated areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as "hanami," has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The notion came from China where the favorite flower was that of the plum.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look much better when they are in their natural environment, so do not be tempted to remove even a "single" specimen.
If you visit a garden organized according to the rules, even gathering "samples" will undoubtedly get you thrown out.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe country and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost everything when you arrive there.
But since it is situated in the "northern tropic" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend either with the heat (always) or the strong sun (less frequently, when the sky is clear).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take goes into Hebron itself, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good topic to provide the basis for holidays around them.
For example, by visiting the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or by cruising in interesting places on the Danube or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also designate the paths for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important celebrations of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians all over the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Naturally, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may very well be a pre-Christian ritual for spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on the evening of Saturday during Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into celebrations as soon as midnight strikes to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands came here by means of swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals couldn't make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in Galapagos.
After the arrival of people in the Galapagos, many mammals have also arrived there, including horses, cows, goats, cats, dogs, and mice.
If you visit areas of Antarctica or the Arctic during winter, you will enjoy the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to watch the auroras, as the sky will be dark almost all the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is minimal and usually not a problem, so you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are the standard business attire and colleagues address each other by their last names or by their job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group efforts instead of praising individual achievements.
Often, workers must obtain approval from their superiors for every decision they make and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without discussion.
