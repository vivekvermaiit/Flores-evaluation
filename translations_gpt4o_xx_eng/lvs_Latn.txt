One antibody cocktail, "ZMapp," initially seemed like a promising solution to the problem, but official studies showed that it has a lower effect on reducing mortality than expected.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was the control agent, that is, the scientists used it as the initial indicator and compared three other types of therapy with this agent.
The USA Gymnastics Federation supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's assertion that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sports, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, rather than discontinuing certification.

It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which was a theory already widely accepted, but also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was chestnut brown on the top and carotenoid-colored on the bottom.
This discovery also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other characteristics typical of feathers, namely barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis most likely appeared in a later phase of evolutionary development than these characteristics.
The feather structure indicates that it was not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers noted that although this is a new dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird plumage, not a baby bird's fluff.
Researchers suggested that although this is a new dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult plumage rather than baby fuzz.

The completed work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made by the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect that the team is looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon affects the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is in a kind of halo surrounding the galaxy, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, elections have never used much technology: voters enter a booth and place the printed sheet with their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The French electoral law establishes a rather strict procedure regarding the election process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes in them at the start of the election and that no other envelopes are added except those of duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe any part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

Huhne has resigned, and in the cabinet, he will be replaced by MP Ed Davey. It is expected that MP Norman Lamb will receive the business minister position, which was previously held by Davey.
Hūnem and Prais must appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The deceased were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Kuebach. The driver was Kuebach.
Edgars Vegilla sustained arm and jaw injuries, while Kristofers Šneiders required facial reconstructive surgery.
The Uka weapon fired inaccurately when he aimed for the head of the fifth man. Schneider has persistent pain, blindness in one eye, a missing part of the skull, and his face is reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via video link from a USAF base in his homeland.
Besides the Wednesday event, Karpanedo also competed in two individual championship descents.
In her first slalom competition, she did not finish the first run. The same result in this race was obtained by 36 out of 116 competitors.
In other races, namely the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sit-down downhill with a total descent time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than first place winner Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place winner Giongi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers did not complete their descents sitting in the women's downhill, and 45 out of all 117 skiers did not rank on the leaderboard.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Aria said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and also recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are called Baba Kandžars, Bhuta Kandžars, Rampro Kandžars, Gaza Kandžars, and Vishnu Kandžars.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused arrived in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when a car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoja has been in the custody of the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering their son.
She is in custody, awaiting the filing of charges and trial, but the testimony provided by eyewitnesses may be invalid because her image has been widely published.
It is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's justice system operates differently, and courts have regarded the publishing of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson from Dundee University notes: 'It seems that journalists are walking on thin ice by publishing photographs and other information about suspects.'"
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is overall responsible for the charges, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be provided at least until the time of the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to a dispute over the borders desired by Palestine, based on the border situation before the 1967 Middle East war.
As reported, topics such as the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley were also discussed.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after signing the agreement, but the Palestinian Authority agrees to such presence only for five years.
The foresters had to carefully guide the shooters participating in the additional pest control trial, as this trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
As part of the partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) and the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, qualified volunteers were engaged.
According to the information provided by Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Cultural Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), four shooters selected for the first shooting operation underwent comprehensive safety briefing and training.
Martelli yesterday took the oath from the new Provisional Election Council (CEP), which is composed of nine members.
This is the fifth CEP for Marteli in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission suggested an earlier resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures intended to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes the violent protests were sparked by the inability to hold elections, some since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases have been reported of iPod malfunctions due to device overheating, which have resulted in a total of six fires, in which four people received minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan reports that it is aware of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that the company "Apple" has informed it about 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company has referred to as "insignificant."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the Apple report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 in the morning local time (Friday, 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office announced that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 weapon.
So far, several hostages have been released, but the deaths of at least six have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers, were quickly released.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Ligin followed in her father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He studied to be a midwife and in 1959 started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital.
When he worked at the hospital, Ligins began studying premature births in his free time.
Her studies indicate that after the hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The agency "Xinhua" reported that on Wednesday government investigators recovered two "black boxes" — flight data recorders.
Luna was also shown respect by other wrestlers who were her contemporaries.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Extreme queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night when two Moons were visible. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Runnels, known as "Goldust", commented that "Luna was just as bizarre as I am... maybe even more bizarre... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place now."
Out of 1,400 residents who were surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of people who opposed the conversion of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This opinion is held by 34% of the survey respondents, who wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The contradictory results of the survey indicate that 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games had to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays, but due to his complaints, his preparedness is being questioned.
He was not allowed to use medication to alleviate the pain because those are prohibited painkillers in these games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
By the beginning of February, this discovery had been verified by several people using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have brought water to Earth along with organic compounds that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, since comet collisions with Earth happened a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
Assumptions are being made that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
“NextGen” is a system which, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to determine pilots' locations with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no plans to add additional vehicles, the overground trains will not stop at Wembley Stadium, and parking and "park and ride" options will not be available at this location.
Fears about the lack of transport increased the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team supporters.
The study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported on the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that the new species has emerged in just two generations, although it was believed that such a process takes much longer, considering the reproduction between endemic Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortis) and immigrant cactus finches (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be cast into all kinds of shapes. It can even be rolled into very fine forms.
It can be stretched like a small wire that can be bent and twisted. It can be forged or shaped into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books, called "illuminated manuscripts".
It is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) a chemical substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H combined in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together, then use clean, damp hands to squeeze them into a ball.
Hand moisture will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities (Crete) and on the island of Santorini (Greece).
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would go together in mixed company.
When calling someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
In space, a satellite receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back.
A rocket sent the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket is required, with a height exceeding 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us - it provides us with much simpler and faster transportation.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
After that, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray house cats) that eat a lot more of various small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is a niche concept - a special task that each cat performs, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A group consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young ones.
Females are usually closely connected to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs — the behavior of these two animals is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats) — and they are just as deadly to their prey.
The athletic tiger is capable of climbing (though not very well), swimming, making long jumps, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not similar to the full voice roar of a lion, but rather like a growling, shouted sentence of words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals hunted by the ocelot are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals for food (prey) by scent, sniffing the tracks left on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision ability and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into the surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river or relocate to a new island so that it's not easy to move back), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and various competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be stronger competitors than they needed to be before.
The initial population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new inhabitants begin to adapt to their new environment, they become less and less similar to the other inhabitants.
After all, after thousands or millions of years, both populations will look so different that they cannot be called a single species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important component of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants obtain their nutrients from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
During its time, the mosasaur was the largest predator, so it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws contained more than 70 very sharp teeth, complemented by additional teeth in the roof of the mouth, and therefore, no one that came in its way had a chance to escape.
We do not know exactly, but it possibly had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a huge dinosaur like T. rex would not be able to deal with it.
Although most Roman foods would be familiar to us, they also had some strange and unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and rodents called dormice.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, while wealthy men liked to hold joint banquets, during which they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly did not use ingredients that were introduced to Europe from America or Asia only in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, moreover, no ancient Roman has ever tasted turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the deity's dwelling place.
People brought offerings to the gods, but the priests tried to cater to the gods' needs by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
In every temple, there was an open temple courtyard and further inside, an inner sanctuary which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temple, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Near East, the house was not so important.
The Jewish family mostly lived outside.
The women cooked food in the yard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Ancient Scandinavian sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, heading further west, discovered a land which he named Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each was a "Scandinavian" country, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie "National Treasures," you can consider that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the following words are written: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text is visible in the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (29¾ x 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
Since the note is most likely added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was governed by "Vichy France". These were the inhabitants of France who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded Southern France; this invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a special culture formed by an extremely large group of people who live and work together, that is, a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, related to the Latin "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and it also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. The culture of civilization means the transfer of knowledge to multiple generations, a lasting cultural impact, and its smooth dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence and are not recognized as fully-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states, based on the Articles of Confederation, for the first time established a weak central government, whose only component was Congress.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state institutions, which often were unwilling to cooperate, hoping that they would implement all the laws it adopted.
It also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
In order for the articles to be amended, the unanimous consent of all states was required, but the states treated the central government so carelessly that their representatives often did not attend.
Italy's national football team, as well as Germany's national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world, having also won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in both international and Olympic games.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), ranking Japan 7th among the world's largest islands.
Thanks to the fact that Japan's territory includes several islands, from a geographical standpoint, it is often called an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan was in the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa" or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of local inhabitants' grain cultivation practices and employing Chinese workers in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared the inclusion of Taiwan as a province in the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it transferred sovereign power over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings constructed along the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally came about.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photograph format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most widespread film size in the era of analog films.
It is still being produced, but more importantly, its image proportions are now used in the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many generally accepted formats (for example, the APS format group) correspond to these image aspect ratios or are very similar to them.
The much distorted and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining the order of an image.
It is indicated there that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the countries of Europe, despite the different languages and traditions.
That all-encompassing power affected absolutely everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizens.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are intended precisely for this purpose.
The central authority of the church in Rome has existed for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many question whether this principle is being adhered to.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began the blockade of the German fleet.
The strategy proved effective in disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated widely accepted international laws codified in several international treaties over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire part of the ocean, which endangered even neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the majority of inhabitants and nations considered pacifism and isolationism to be the most important.
After the horrors and atrocities experienced during the First World War, countries wanted to avoid a recurrence of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to begin work at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous workplace) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way to depict different time periods; every stage of China's development or every ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty, there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a brutal struggle for the throne occurred among many nobles.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient China's history, with thousands of people perishing while fighting for the most important place in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, all male applicants could apply for positions, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military field, as now army service ranks were awarded based on a person's characteristics, rather than belonging to a certain class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people of the working class from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in transcendental questions. He often went to the cave, which became known as the Cave of Hira on the Mountain of Light, to engage in contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the turning points of eras, vividly shows Muhammad’s inclination towards spirituality.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if someone knew it existed. Upon entering the cave, complete isolation sets in.
Nothing more than clear, beautiful skies above and many mountains all around can be seen. From inside the cave, not much from the outside world can be either seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many colossal pyramid structures erected in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "arc up" sign looks like a V and the "arc down" looks like a bracket or a square that lacks the bottom edge.
Up means that you should start from the peak and bend the bow, down means that you should start at the handle (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement is stronger and more convincing.
You can mark your notes, but remember that the printed notes are indicated for the purpose of musical harmony, so they should usually be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles due to a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage surrounded by the crowd, they went back to Paris, with people shouting threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a gang member waved the head of the slain royal guard in front of the frightened queen at Versailles.
The expenses of the American imperialist war for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government flowed through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits gained from the long exploitation of the Filipino people formed the core income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the environment that prompted the creation of the order.
The era during which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages - a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages were the Early Middle Ages, and after the High Middle Ages followed the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, ranging from technological progression or technological imperative to the strong understanding that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their expression in technologies.
In most interpretations of technological determinism, two main ideas are highlighted: the development of technology largely occurs independently of cultural or political influence, and technologies themselves create an "impact" on societies, and this impact is consequential rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars definitely contribute to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs associated with car use.
A large number of private cars also means a higher number of accidents, resulting in new methods being invented in healthcare to repair body damage.
Romanticism largely had cultural determinism, which stemmed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography influenced people, and over time, a culture and customs related to the respective geographical region emerged, which were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as they were in harmony with the community's place.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known as a center of luxury goods, starting approximately from the year 400 AD and ending around the year 1100.
Its status in the 12th century became less significant as the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than those available in the Byzantine markets.
It was precisely at this time that Constantinople lost its title as the fashion capital, and Paris acquired it.
The Gothic style gained popularity in the 10th–11th centuries and later in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was largely influenced by the Byzantine culture living in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, fashion in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of development from that time was that as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is a type of agriculture conducted to grow enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system in which seeds collected from the ecoregion are used together with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, the majority of farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, as is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their participants.
Characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of subcultures often emphasize their identity by using a distinctive and symbolic style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is examples of unsuccessful cases of children whose parents did not provide socialization during their upbringing due to neglect, difficulties, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been restrained by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child's abandonment occurred because the parents rejected the child's severe intellectual or physical disorders.
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is believed that some were raised by animals; some say they have lived in the wild on their own.
Growing up entirely with animals, a feral child exhibits almost the same behavior (with physical limitations) as the respective animal taking care of them, for example, fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make the training process easier and more interesting, but it is a step forward.
The support approach is not a learning method, but rather a means of support for people learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can occur both virtually and in reality, in other words, a teacher can be a support, but just as well the small paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized into the software and are designed to ask, suggest, and explain procedures that a student might find difficult to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion cases.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and educational, yet it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safety zone for these children.
Our system, which provides for the upbringing of children from other families, must offer a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster families must provide everything that was lacking in the homes from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet create additional dimensions regarding the usage and gratification approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
While studying the target audience's reaction to websites, Īmijs and Makkords (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivating aspects.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions - facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that a person can determine if someone is lying by correctly understanding facial micro-expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech, are still capable of accurately determining how truthful it is.
He even assumes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, but selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shift variations back and forth between these two sets.
Primates with a digestive system like humans find it difficult to obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant resources available in the savannah.
Furthermore, it can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been proteins available in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Meanwhile, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a lot of protein, which contains essential amino acids.
Considering all that, it would be no surprise if our ancestors also solved their "protein problem" similarly to how the savannah-dwelling chimpanzees do it today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposeful awakening during normal sleep, falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
It can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm so that you are conscious but not fully awake.
If you change the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another option based on biorhythms is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before bed to force oneself to get up and go urinate.
The amount of a person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in the person's body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive the current life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders reaching this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga methods.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path to all-encompassing love.
During Kundalini yoga practice, the Kundalini (enlightenment) energy is awakened using yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is Deity Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and as a result, cooperation was established between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, due to the differing systems, processes, and cultures, these countries became hostile again.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was destined to last for the next 40 years, and through the use of proxy armies, actual warfare was conducted on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenders had already been defeated, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became morally obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships for transporting goods remains the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The mission of the naval fleet has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, tried to halt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would most likely have conquered Britain just like all the other European countries.
Goats were most likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient peoples and tribes began to breed them, as it allowed easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed across hillsides and other grazing areas, and were tended by goat herders, who were often children or adults, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These herding methods are still used to this day.
Carriages were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse railway consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed draft horses to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the bumpy roads of that time.
Sleepers began to be used from the very beginning to prevent the rails from moving. However, it was gradually understood that the rails would be even more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
It became common practice, but the iron caused increased wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known form of movement was walking; people began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means standing man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as commonly thought.
Bipedal specimens were already found in the fossils of the Australopithecus genus, which lived 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although representatives of the Sahelanthropus genus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and even be activists to some extent to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, it is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is clear that the world has significantly changed due to humanity's scientific and technological achievements, and problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, the draft of the document, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing office of John Dunlap, which was located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides" (Declaration of Independence).
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9, he read it to his troops in New York. One copy reached London on August 10.
25 "Dunlap broadsides", which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many features that are reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on both their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in binary number form.
A binary number can have only two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or in computer language – bits.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately noticed. Symptoms like vomiting are sufficiently general to not diagnose immediately.
The most definite sign of internal poisoning can be the presence of open medicines or toxic household chemical containers.
Read the first aid instructions on the label for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "beetle" in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient association with bedbugs, which have become highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are parasitic pests that have adapted to life in nests or by attaching themselves to other bodies.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis have been registered, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have revealed that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their or their child's best interest.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. In fact, this method is the driving force behind the majority of scientific research.
There is also experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations can also drive scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinion was recognized in all matters of science, including psychology.
As fewer and fewer people knew the Greek language, the Western countries were separated from their roots in Greek philosophy and science.
The presence of endogenous cycles and their formation process, considering the biological clock, often have a decisive influence on many observed rhythms in psychology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms that are not merely a response to external periodic signals have been confirmed for the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate freely even without external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading propositions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, marking either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material unit, and whether the affected cells are stem cell line cells.
Only mutations in germ cell lines can be passed on to children, but mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy landscapes, including plants and wildlife.
In these places, you can engage in activities such as hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, or visit parks and study information about the ecosystem.
As an example, one can mention a visit to the island of Borneo to take photographs and get to know orangutans.
Every morning, people from small rural towns travel by car to their workplaces, while others arrive in their place, whose workplace is located where they have just left from.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the transportation system based on private cars.
Scientists are now pointing out that an economy with such massive carbon emissions has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and participates in transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear about similar complaints regarding water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do such complaints arise about transport systems, why do they encounter problems every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is the root of the problem deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their possible interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is not possible to predict a driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers most often has a fairly consistent range, therefore a certain consistency can be determined in traffic flows, and they can be approximately calculated mathematically.
To better reflect traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, designing, and processes of roadway infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily avoid enemies, as well as more effectively find food and mates.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward, tucking them along the entire length of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were of the opposite opinion: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because there is no sense that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places six miles wide.
The Amazon discharges 20% of the water volume that flows into the oceans from all the world's rivers.
The main Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles). It gets water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained unsurpassed in size and outstanding technical execution of construction.
The ancient New Kingdom Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communication.
The Italian language is also the everyday language used by most people working in this country, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are all found in nature in their free form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more specific elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It more closely resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many chemical elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be such alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that a single period at the end of this sentence would consist of trillions of atoms.
Thus, when the pencil emerged, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of the pencil diminished, and it began to be used less frequently.
Nowadays people write messages on a computer screen, and there's no slightest need for a sharpener.
We can only imagine how the keyboard will change when some newer invention appears.
An atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a way like rolling heavy carts up a hill. Again, by splitting the nucleus, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to split with little prompting or just like that.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearer side, but 100 km thick on the farther side.
It is thinner under the basalt plain and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The basis of content theories is to determine what inspires people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized upon reaching adulthood.
These theories examine what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Managers who start leading their former colleagues typically exhibit one of two types of behavior. At one end of the spectrum is the effort to maintain the status of being "one of the group."
Managers of this type have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, carrying out performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the leader becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change absolutely everything the team has done up to this point and turn it into their own achievement.
Ultimately, the leader is fully responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Such behavior often causes disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as a point of communication for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet according to the different time zones that their local management might not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (page 109, Larson and LaFasto's book, published in 1989) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to invest time in the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? One of the reasons why the concept of a learning organization is put into practice is innovation.
If all available resources are utilized effectively in the organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process in which the organization works together to overcome an obstacle can foster the development of a new, innovative process to meet the client's needs.
Before an organization turns to innovation, leaders must develop a culture of innovation as well as an organization that shares knowledge and fosters continuous learning.
Eindžels (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher level results.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. Therefore, it narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
Scientists in their research are supported by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
It gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes occurring in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is largely associated with science fiction, it is an extremely important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of technology.
In AI research, machines are made to automate tasks that require programmable action.
As an example, control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client questions and make diagnoses, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and face can be mentioned.
Such things have become separate industries that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being integrated into various home computer and video game software applications.
A field trip constitutes a large part of the learning process. Often, a teacher would gladly take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual learning excursions. Students, sitting with their classmates, can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art.
Virtual sharing of study trips is a great way to discuss the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Beneta School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year this website is redesigned, but previous versions are preserved online as a history album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although often at first, when students start blogging, they do not pay attention to grammar and spelling, the presence of readers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critically minded target audience, the blogger starts striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "makes students explore the surrounding world more broadly." The necessity to maintain readers' interest motivates students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a technique that promotes collaboration and motivates students to learn outside of school hours.
Appropriate use of blogging "can stimulate students to become more analytical and think critically. By actively using the materials available on the internet, students can define their stance in the context of other written content and express their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital with numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while in the northern part one can enjoy the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
All this and much more gives Ontario what others consider to be the real Canada.
Extensive areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated, and in some places, there are virtually uninhabited wilderness regions.
For a comparison of population numbers that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the USA is much larger than the population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest, and when it comes to wildlife, it is like a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France, and are also known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also introduced Islam to the lands - on the Comoro Islands and in Mayotte, it happened on a large scale.
The European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, this region borders the Sahel region, but in the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is advisable for all traveling women to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, situations may arise that they might perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for a woman to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Do not be afraid to refuse men and reject their attention (it does not matter if it is a cultural difference or not, it is still unacceptable).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used it as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casablanca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badija, and Spanish traders, who established trading bases there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping places in all of Morocco.
In the old city of Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, ceramic dishes, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of trinkets, but all of this is meant only for tourists.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo popular with tourists, located right on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly those in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits beyond Goma should be reviewed to understand the current state of battles in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo along some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking sites in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a "boda-boda" (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short trip is approximately 500 Congolese francs.
Due to the fact that it is relatively difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor used to denote exotic, distant lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sand, it was included in the list of endangered world heritage monuments.
This was one of the main stops where Henry Louis Gates' PBS documentary "Wonders of the African World" was filmed.
The city is in stark contrast to the other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic rather than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which sustains various wildlife.
It is one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and is considered the most significant of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all national parks in South Africa, this park also has daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It might be beneficial to also purchase a “Wild Card”, which provides access to certain South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and it is a place that many tourists consider as the main one.
The ensemble of buildings that forms the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glistening bar chart, clearly illustrated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, head away from the island to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that was taken over by British colonizers as their own, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are, however, not only mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining patches of mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans area is 3850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in its territory.
The buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those on the eastbound and Jakara/Bumthang routes, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Since inter-district buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses that are comfortable and durable.
Ride-sharing taxis offer a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Bhutanese ngultrums) and Punakha (200 Bhutanese ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully ready for operation in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs control points is scheduled.
The Guaraní was the most significant indigenous group that inhabited the present-day eastern part of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence farming.
In the Chaco region, there lived other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, foraging, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Huge Province of the Indies," emerged in the 16th century as a result of the interaction between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here several other times a year.
For information about tournaments and places where tickets for polo games can be purchased, look on the "Asociacion Argentina de Polo" website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at a value equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the "FIC West Store".
On the islands, the British pound is generally accepted anywhere, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
In the more remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency might be; ask the owners in advance to determine the acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to find the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands' territory, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; during the summer months, the temperature usually exceeds the mark of +30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively damp: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but if wind and humidity occur simultaneously, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park supervision authorities' instructions, a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, as well as 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife, must be observed!
Although they may seem docile, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can also be dangerous, so it's better to keep away from them.
Also, remember that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population reaches just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and since 1959 it has been the official capital of Samoa.
The port was the infamous site of the maritime standoff of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank, except for the British cruise ship. Almost 200 Americans and Germans perished.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city center turned into the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Thanks to Auckland's two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The Northern Shore beaches (in the Northern Province of Harbor) are washed by the Pacific Ocean, and they stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops located on the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Numur viens', it is not a distinctly flavored beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more popular.
It is perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but if you are anxious, bottled water is easy to find.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of 'coffee with milk'. Black coffee is referred to as 'espresso', cappuccino is made with a huge heap of whipped cream (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Trips to the reef are organized all year round, but injuries for the mentioned reasons in the reef occur rarely.
However, heed the recommendations of authorities, take into account all signs, and carefully observe safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear on beaches and river mouths from October to April in the northern part of the city in the year 1770. Occasionally, they can also be found at other times.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not commonly found ocean inhabitants; their main distribution area is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
An advance reservation gives travelers peace of mind that upon arriving at their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although through a travel agent you have the opportunity to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport services to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or gather other documents for the destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most of the attendees choose to live in tents, and the majority of them consider it an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to be near the epicenter of the events, you need to arrive early to find a tent spot close to the music.
Don't forget: even if the music on the main stages has already stopped playing, there may be places at the festival where music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas designated for families with young children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltics in winter, check the hut's location, as crossing the ice creates quite a terrible noise for those most affected by this activity.
Cruise ships in St. Petersburg allow time for city sightseeing. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the rules).
Casinos usually do everything possible to keep their visitors as long as possible and to make them spend more money. Typically, there are no windows and clocks in casino premises, and sometimes it is difficult to find the exit.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and retain them indoors.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered at the establishment's expense. However, alcohol consumption impairs judgment, and every good player knows how important it is to keep a clear mind.
Anyone intending to drive a vehicle in polar regions or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, so you cannot drive the same way as on clear asphalt.
In snowstorms, a lot of snow can fall in a very short time, which can cause congestion.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling snow, a snowstorm, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, so traffic continues mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari trips are possibly the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most vivid adventure for many visitors.
The commonly used term "safari" refers to land journeys to view the stunning African wildlife, particularly the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, so standard equipment will allow them to be well observed.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they can be seen better with binoculars.
A safari walk (also known as a "bush walk," "safari hike," or "walking safari") is a hike that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, as the Olympic Games were also held there in 1964.
If you had booked flights and a hotel for the year 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you might have found yourself in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus pandemic-related cancellation policies are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost from ¥2500 to ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing approximately ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. In many hotels, you can request an ironing board and iron if they are not available in the room.
If an iron is not available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Ensure that the fabric does not become too hot (as this may cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, even scorch).
There are various water purification methods, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, but in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if in doubt, consider purchasing water in a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal parasites that are unknown to them in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause inflammation or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions, often stretching through an isolated rural area.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful – they have steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The permitted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections of the road—usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h)—and it is even more important to strictly adhere to them.
However, strangely enough, the mobile phone signal here is much stronger than in other sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German culinary products are quite enjoyable, moreover in Bavaria they are very hearty and diverse, similar to the southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries with apple filling are available all year round, while in the summer you can also find ones with cherry and plum filling.
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Often, the popular cakes pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small, firm, and rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from meat or vegetables, adding herbs and spices.
Curry can be both "dry" and "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.

Indonesian cuisine symbolizes the vast diversity of regional culinary traditions across the entire country, offering choices from 17,000 islands.
However, without broader explanations, this term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a wide range of simple, spicy dishes. The dominant flavors preferred by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrup irons are supports for a rider's feet, hanging on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater rider stability, but may raise safety concerns as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrups, the rider can be dragged along the ground if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, several precautionary measures should be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if the rider falls and pulls them backward.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most outstanding climbing site, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a wide variety of giant granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from the summits. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes on its endless rock walls.
The downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding down a snow-covered area with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
For many enthusiasts (occasionally referred to in English as "ski bums"), skiing is the main activity of their travels, and they plan all their vacations around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very ancient - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport began at least in the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related, but does not necessarily involve skiing or mountaineering; in the latter case, these activities take place on steeper slopes, and require sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than walking — however, you will very rarely achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and a prepared track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across several countries would mean countless visa applications and passport controls.
However, in this regard, the Schengen Area operates similarly to a single country.
While being in this area, it is usually possible to cross borders without repeated passport checks at border control points.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
There are geographical differences in the definition, where the age limit in places like North America might be lower than in Europe.
The craftsmen's products could be called antique items, although they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is essential for the Sami as a means of livelihood, and the culture surrounding trade is also significant for representatives of many other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather subsisted on fishing, hunting, and similar activities, primarily using reindeer as working animals.
Nowadays, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is a significant source of income in the Sami-inhabited territory of Lapland.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among people who are not of Romani ethnicity, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.

The guides provide only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The submitted opinions are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
The term severe weather refers to any dangerous natural phenomena that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Harsh weather conditions can affect any place in the world, and they can vary depending on geographical, topographical, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are types and consequences of severe weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Harsh regional and seasonal natural phenomena include, for example, snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks affecting the area, as they may impact all travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
By entering "hostile environment training course" in the internet search engine, you are most likely to find the address of a local company.
The course usually examines all the discussed issues in much greater detail, and practical tasks must also be completed.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, various types of first aid training, and sometimes weapon handling.
There are many different books and magazines about survival in extreme conditions, but there are very few publications about living in war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports without specifying gender (X), or documents updated to match the desired name and gender, varies.
To the same extent differs the readiness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Moreover, since September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have become much more intrusive.
Transgender people in the pre-operative period cannot count on their privacy and dignity not being violated during a scanner check.
Rip currents are a backward flow of waves moving away from the beach, often near a reef or something similar.
Thanks to the underwater topology, the return flow has concentrated in some of the deeper segments, where a rapid current to the depths can form.
In most cases, death is caused by exhaustion resulting from attempting to swim back against the current, as it may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to go to a place where you won't be pulled in anymore, or depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can wait for rescuers to arrive.
Reverse culture shock sets in faster than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the cultural habits of your homeland.
When you initially went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People may not realize that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things in this area for children.
Before the show begins, you can view the pyramids in darkness and silence.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here. The story about sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries have territorial claims to the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and have the most bases - sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villju las Estreljasu.
There is also Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano still forms an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region located in the south of the peninsula and is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau, then reappear, forming the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided into two similar parts by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, are Antarctica's highest mountains - the Vinson Massif - with its highest peak being Mount Vinson at an elevation of 4,892 meters.
In remote locations where there is no mobile network coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible option.
A satellite phone is not quite the same as a mobile phone because making a call requires being outside and in a direct line with the satellite.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider will be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
For those planning to take a study break, the opportunity to travel and learn is becoming increasingly popular.
It is particularly popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, applying for a gap year program in another country can even improve the chances of resuming higher education in the home country.
Usually, there will be a tuition fee for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boat trips. In the "land of a thousand lakes," there are also thousands of islands located in the lakes or coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is not always necessary.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for sailing with any yacht, trips with smaller boats or even a kayak offer a completely different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland because every seventh or eighth person owns a boat.
This corresponds to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that, by returning and staying overnight on the ship, you can visit the historic city for a couple of days.
If you go ashore only on excursions from the ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise ship brochures mention Berlin (Germany). As you can verify on the map, the sea is not anywhere near Berlin, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a daunting experience for people of any age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic incident.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, overcoming the fear arising from ignorance and the inability to control might be helped by an understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during a flight.
Courier service providers charge high prices for fast delivery. Often, time is the determining factor for sending business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies had their own airplanes, but on other routes, as well as smaller companies, they encountered a problem.
If they sent things by air transport, several days would have been needed for unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way to get it sorted more quickly was to send it as registered baggage. The airline's rules won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so you will need to be involved.
The unmistakable way to fly first class or business class is to pay a thick wad of cash for this privilege (or better yet, have your company pay for it on your behalf).
However, it's not cheap: usually, you have to pay four times more for business class than for a standard economy class ticket, and in first class, even eleven times more!
Basically, there is no point in even searching for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a particular group of higher-class air passengers who are willing to pay extra for the opportunity to reach their destination faster and fly in comfort, therefore they charge an appropriate price.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.

Observatories built in the past are usually outdated nowadays and are used as museums or places for education.
Since in those golden times light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, they were usually located in cities or places that are much more easily accessible than those built nowadays.
Most of the modern telescopes designed for research are huge buildings located in remote regions with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as 'hanami', has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the Japanese apricot was the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other representatives of the aristocracy in the imperial court.

All animals that initially arrived on the islands got here by swimming, flying, or drifting with the current.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not reach there, thus the giant tortoise is the primary herbivore in the Galápagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It provides a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will be dark more or less all day and night.
