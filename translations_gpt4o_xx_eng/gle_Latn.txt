USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and agrees that it is absolutely necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and the sport, might be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than by decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how abuse of the extent reported by survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone undetected for so long and through which any necessary changes would be accepted.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal — to make the sport of gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can fulfill their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked as an advisor to John F. Kennedy and then to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

Not only does this confirm that certain dinosaurs at least had feathers, a theory already widespread, but it provides details not usually found from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown on top and pale or carroty underneath.
The discovery gives us insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the shaft (known as rachis) is not well developed in the dinosaur's feathers, but they have other feather characteristics — barbs and barbules — the researchers understood that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary stage than those other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult bird and not the fluff of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathered specimen represents the adult bird rather than the fine down of the young bird.
Two police officers were killed and more than twenty others were injured when a car bomb exploded at a police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning.
The governor's office said that nineteen of those injured were police officers.
The police said they believed a militant alleged to be connected with Daesh (ISIL) was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of all stars in the system was driven by their luminosity and rotation, and not by anything else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the more inactive the star is regarding magnetic changes.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made on the Sagittarius star system.
Tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way would create the effect that the team was looking for.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, creating tides, the Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to come to the conclusion that dark matter influences other dark matter, just as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of ring around the galaxy, and that it is made up of many small particles.

It was Dr. Tony Moll who discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very troubling and frightening because of the very high death rate."
Certain patients might have contracted the germ in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 other close contacts.
However, it seems that the percentage of XDR-TB in the total group of people with tuberculosis remains low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 infected people at any given time in South Africa.

The government also promised millions of generous vaccines against encephalitis, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines this year to the areas historically most affected were delayed due to a lack of funds and lower priority compared to other diseases.

Infrared images show that the temperature changes from night and day reveal that they are equivalent to caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface by day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a moderately stable temperature, but it is consistent with being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was traditionally a low-tech experience: the voters themselves enter the booth, place a pre-printed paper sheet indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identification, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
By the French electoral law, the procedures are coded in quite a strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those belonging to properly identified and duly authorized voters.
Candidates can place their representatives there to verify every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by a volunteer team under strict supervision, and according to specific procedures.

The blame is being placed on the United Nations peacekeepers, who came to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, for spreading the disease that began near the troops' camp.
It is claimed in the lawsuit that waste from the UN camp was not properly decontaminated, which is the reason for the bacterial leakage into a tributary of the Artibonite River, which is one of the largest rivers in Haiti.
From the 1800s onward, Haiti had no problem related to the disease until the troops arrived.
The Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti has referenced types of independent studies that suggest the UN peacekeeping battalion from Nepal inadvertently brought the disease to Haiti.
Danielle Lantagne, a United Nations disease expert, said it was likely that the peacekeepers were responsible for the outbreak.
Hamilton confirmed that it was Howard University Hospital that admitted the patient and that he/she is in stable condition.

Huhne has resigned and Ed Davey MP will take his place in the Cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take the Business Minister position that Davey left.
Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The two who were killed were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was driving.
Edgar Veguilla's hand and jaw were injured and Kristoffer Schneider was left in such a way that reconstructive surgery is required on his face.
Uka's weapon failed while it was aimed at the fifth man's head. Schnieder is suffering from pain as well as blindness in one eye, part of his skull is missing and his face has been reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider gave his evidence via video conference from a USAF base in his home country.
Outside of Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two individual races at the Championships.
The Slalom was her first race, in which she got 'Did Not Finish' for her first run. The same result was had by 36 out of the 116 competitors in that race.
In her second race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a total run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Claudia Loesch from Austria, and 1:09.02 slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom in total failed to get a ranking in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of those who are accused.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police chief, said that the accused came into court with covers on their faces.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, he suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road was closed where the crash occurred for a while as the emergency services were freeing the driver from a red Audi TT.
At the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth is where he was initially.
After that, he was moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then and is accused of the murder of her own son.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be tainted because her pictures were widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and courts have considered that publishing a photograph could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from Dundee University said "it seems that journalists are not maintaining the right balance if they publish pictures etc. of suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is overall in charge of prosecutions, informed journalists that no further comment will be made until at least an indictment is made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over borders, borders that Palestine is seeking based on the boundaries that existed before the Middle East War in 1967.
It is said that the future of the State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley were among the topics covered.
Israel demands to have a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, but the PA only agrees to a presence for five years.
Supervisors had to closely monitor the shooters in the supplementary pest control trial, as the trial would be monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, says that comprehensive safety and training instruction was provided to the four shooters selected for the first round of shooting.
Martely swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is the fifth CEP that Martelly has had in the past four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended that the incumbent president resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards fresh elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime, protests that began in October.
The failure to hold elections, some of which were due since 2011, was the reason for the protests, which were sometimes violent.
There are about 60 reported cases where an iPod became excessively hot and malfunctioned, resulting in two fires, and leaving four people with minor burn injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says they were aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry's response was to say that it was "a matter of complete regret" that Apple delayed the report.
At nineteen minutes past seven (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday) in the morning, the Mariana earthquake struck.
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also indicated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolanda Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and it was confirmed that at least six people have been lost so far.
He released six hostages, including the children and the elderly, early on, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later the photographers took the old woman's place because she wanted to use the toilet. Mendoza was knocked down by a bullet.
Liggins did as his father had done before him and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating, in his spare time, premature labor.
His research showed that fetal lung maturation speeds up with the administration of a hormone.
It was heard from Xinhua that government investigators found two flight recorder 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. That was as unusual as she was. A strong woman."
According to a comment made by Dustin "Goldust" Runnels, "Luna was as eccentric as me...maybe more so...I love her and will miss her greatly...I hope she is in a better place now."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the federal election of 2010, there has been an 8 percent increase since 2008 in the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
The Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the federal election campaign in 2010 that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the poll hold the same view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last reigning monarch in Australia.
At the extreme points of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner in swimming was in the 100m and 200m freestyle competitions and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, his physical ability was in doubt.
He was unable to take the drugs, which are needed to alleviate his pain, because they are prohibited by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
The discovery was verified by several people by the beginning of February, using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
There is the possibility that comets were sources of delivering water to the Earth along with organic material capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets come into existence, especially how Earth came to be, from comets having collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and last month he signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He said the rumors were nothing but "political blather and nonsense."
There is speculation that he will run in the presidential election in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and cutting carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology to allow an air traffic controller to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide more precise information to pilots.
No additional transport is being provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking or park and ride facilities available at the park.
There was concern about a lack of transport and the potential consequently that it would be necessary to play the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
In a study published on Thursday in the journal Science, it was reported on the creation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species emerged within two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be fashioned into many types of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn until it is a thin wire, which can be dipped and plated. It can be hammered or rolled out into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to embellish the hand-painted pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. An indicator can be made from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical is what indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions with their electrons removed are protons (since a hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders together vigorously and use clean, wet hands to squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outermost layers, which will feel strange and create a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been discovered in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Additionally, there were toilets in Egypt, Persia, and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women would gather together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away from you, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and it is reflected back down, almost immediately.
A rocket put the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and views.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope up into space.
The change in the world since the wheel was invented is incredible. The biggest thing to come out of it is transport systems that are easier and faster.
It is from there that the train, the car, and many other means of transportation came.
Below them, one will find medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including pet cats and those outside) that eat the even more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of the niche is the easiest way to explain their success, each individual cat has a special job so that it is not competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats, they live in large groups known as prides.
A pride of lions typically consists of one adult male and up to three related males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
It is usual for there to be a close relationship among the females, because it is a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or hounds, animals that resemble lions (but are not other big cats) in their strangely enough and eternally deadly behavior towards their prey as well.
The tiger is a versatile athlete, capable of climbing (though not well), swimming, leaping long distances, and pulling with a force that is five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar. These four cats are the only ones among all the cats that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion; it is more like a sentence of snarled, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists think that an ocelot uses its sense of smell to locate animals to eat (prey), by sniffing out their trail on the ground.
They have night vision that gives them a very good view in the darkness, and they move stealthily, too. Owls hunt their prey by camouflaging with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (if they move over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment unlike the one they were in before.
There are different resources and different competitors in this new environment, so the new community will need different features or adaptations to compete strongly.
The original community is just as it always was, and they need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new community begins to adapt to their new environment, it happens that the similarities between them and the other community are reduced.
Ultimately, after thousands of years, or even millions, the two communities will appear so different from each other that they cannot be designated as the same species.
Speciation is what we call this process, which means exactly creating a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and we make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time and therefore feared nothing except another mosasaur.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth as well as more teeth in his tail, which meant that there was no escape from him for anything that crossed him.
We do not know for certain, but she may have had a forked tongue. Her diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that she was a cannibal, even.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a huge dinosaur like the T. rex wouldn't stand a chance against him.
While we might be familiar with most of their food, the Romans had their share of exotic or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent known as the dormouse.
Another thing that was different was that the poor people and the women would eat their food sitting in a chair, but the rich men preferred the custom of having a feast together where they lay on their side while eating their meals.
It is not possible that the people of Ancient Rome ate foods that were brought to Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and an ancient Roman never got a taste of turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods and it was believed that this was where the god resided.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
In every temple there was an open temple courtyard and then there was a sanctuary of secrets where no one was allowed to enter except priests.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of a pyramid, known as ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
A special sanctuary for the god was at the top of the tower.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Much of the York family's life took place outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the yard; the shops were nothing but open counters looking out onto the street. The houses were built of stone.
There was no great forest in the land of Canaan, which meant that wood was very expensive.
Not many people settled in Greenland. It is said in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland because of murder, and while traveling further west, he discovered Greenland and Greenland is the name he gave it.
But regardless of what he had discovered, Inuit tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was a 'Nordic country', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While it is not definitely known who wrote it, we know that the large parchment document (which is 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
Therefore, the notation was probably added only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed succeeded in liberating northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was under the control of the French "Vichy". These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On the 15th of August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion called "Operation Dragoon."
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture in which a significant large group of people participate and live and work together in cooperation, it is a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil; it is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which in some way organizes the extent of a society.
City-states are the precursors of a nation. Civilization culture is understood to involve the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and relatively widespread dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any substantial historical evidence behind, and as a result, they are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially created a central government that was weak—and the Congress was the only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce all its acts, but those authorities often refused to cooperate.
He also had no authority to override tax laws or tariffs between states.
Unanimous consent had to be obtained from all the states before the Articles could be amended, and the states were so indifferent about the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and the Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the collection/group of islands that is Japan, it is often referred to, in geographical terms, as an "archipelago."
Taiwan was first mentioned in the 15th century when European sailors who sailed past the island named it Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
A Dutch East India Company established a headquarters in the southwest of Taiwan in 1624, which initiated a change in production practices regarding the native grain, and workers from China were employed to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after they were defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which they cede control over Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better taste of what they looked like in the past.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continued to the present day.
For example, 35mm is the most common still image photography format in the world, which was also the most widely used size in filmmaking at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its orientation ratio has continued to digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high, which could confuse someone.
As it is said, 3:2 is the same as the aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio).
There are many common formats (such as APS formats) that are equal to or very close to this orientation ratio.
The rule of thirds is a simple guideline, although people sometimes criticize or mock it, that creates dynamism and provides some order to an image.
He says that the place where the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally cross is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
During that period in European history, an examination of the Catholic Church began after it had become very rich and powerful.
For over a thousand years, the states of Europe were bound together by the Christian faith despite different languages and customs.
His pervasive power influenced everyone from kings to slaves.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this core principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of the war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
It was an effective strategy, through which essential military and civilian supplies were cut, although these sanctions violated generally accepted international law, which has been codified in various international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain planted mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, which put even neutral ships at risk.
As a limited response to this tactic occurred, Germany expected a similar response in its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the most prevalent attitudes among the majority of citizens and nations.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such things for generations to come.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States he had only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a particular way was used to denote different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Additionally, between each dynasty a period of unrest would occur in which the provinces were divided. The most well-known of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During those periods, there used to be fierce warfare among many of the nobility who were fighting to take possession of the throne.
One of the bloodiest eras in Ancient Chinese history was the era of the Three Kingdoms, when thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects, for example the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Additionally, after the Revolution, every male applicant was given the opportunity for a career, which allowed those with the highest ambition and the greatest success to thrive in their lives.
It is the same in the case of the military because military ranks are now based on merit rather than social class.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad took a great interest in spiritual matters. He used to meditate in a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light).
With the cave itself, which still survives, a very vivid image is given of Muhammad's spiritual desires.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is really hard to find out if anyone knew it existed. When you are inside the cave, it is complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the beautiful clear sky above and the multitude of surrounding mountains. Little of this life is to be seen or heard from inside the cave.
One of the Seven Wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures erected to honor deceased Pharaohs.
There are several pyramids on the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), along with several smaller tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's women and family members.
The "bow up" mark is very similar to a V and the "bow down" mark is like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
It is usual to have a softer sound with an up bow, and a louder, more commanding sound with a down bow.
There is no problem with writing down your own notes, but don't forget that the printed musical notes are there for a musical reason, so attention should be paid to them as a result.
A crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, all terrified, to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris with a crowd of people around them shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a person from the crowd shook the head of a royal guard, who was killed at Versailles, right in front of the frightened Queen.
It was the people of the Philippine Islands themselves who paid for the costs of the wars associated with U.S. imperialism as they attempted to subjugate the Philippine Islands.
They had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA to pay for much of the expenditure and interest on bonds established in the name of the government of the Philippine Islands through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits gained from the exploitation inflicted on the people of the Philippine Islands would have been the fundamental gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context from which the order was derived.
The High Middle Ages is the common name for that period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) when the events in question occurred.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and after that came the Late Middle Ages, which is considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in reality, from the push of technology or technological necessity to a strong understanding that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and expressed in technology.
The majority of readings on technological determinism share two general theories: that the development of technology itself follows a path that surpasses cultural or political influence and that technology has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially learned.
For example, it can be said that because the car exists, the development of roads is necessary.
However, national road networks are not viable for a few cars, so new productivity methods are developed to reduce the cost associated with car ownership.
There are more accidents on the roads due to car ownership, and from this comes the development of new methods in healthcare to heal bodily injuries.
A significant aspect of cultural certainty was associated with romanticism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged that related to that geography, and these, which were in harmony with the place in society, were superior to the laws that were unfairly enforced.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
He was renowned as the heart of prosperity from 400 A.D. until about 1100 A.D.
Their status declined primarily during the twelfth century due to the crusades that returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what was available in the Byzantine markets.
It was at the time when the title of fashion capital was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
It was the highlight of the Gothic style period between the 10th - 11th century and the 14th century.
In the early days, Byzantine culture in the east greatly influenced the style of clothing.
Nevertheless, due to slow communication methods, styles in the east could be delayed by 25 or 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, a style of its own developed among the people of Western Europe, and this was one of the greatest developments of the time. It was their experience of the Crusades that led people to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture through which enough food is produced for the farmer and his family/families and nothing more.
Subsistence agriculture is often a simple, organic system, in which saved seeds that are native to that ecoregion are used in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is how it is in most developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people who think alike and feel that there is no place for them in mainstream society; it is an opportunity for them to gain an understanding of their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
Linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or various factors combined may determine whether a particular subculture is a distinct subculture.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by symbolically using a particular style, including fashion, gestures, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized with the help of adults as they were growing up, for reasons related to neglect, misfortune, or willful abuse.
It is said that such children are "wild." There are certain wild children who have been kept trapped (sometimes by their own parents); in some cases, it was a severe mental or physical disability in the child that caused the parents to abandon the child.
Child abuse or serious trauma may have been involved with wild children before they were abandoned or before they escaped from home.
It is alleged that animals raised other people; it is said that some of them lived in the wild by themselves.
When non-human animals raise a person from the start, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost identical to the behavior of the particular caregiving animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning but a tool that provides support for people who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are integrated within the software and are designed with procedures that might be challenging for the student to handle on their own, to question, encourage, and explain.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many different reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that is the case.
We feel that the Foster Care System is a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system was designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is intended to provide all the needs that were missing at home, from which the children were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
Additional dimensions result from the characteristics of the Internet in terms of the uses and gratification approach.
For example, it is said that "learning" and "socializing" are what motivate many people to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as new motivational aspects when they investigated community responses to websites.
Due to the use of video recording, important discoveries have been made in terms of interpreting microexpressions, facial gestures that last a few milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that a person can detect if someone is telling lies by interpreting micro-expressions.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
He even suggests that it may have that ability to make sense of human behavior in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic diversity: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic diversity, and through selection it is removed from the pool of expressed changes.
Separation and reconnection move the diversity back and forth between two lines in each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human to satisfy its amino acid needs from the plant resources available.
Furthermore, there are disastrous consequences if this is not done: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources most easily available were the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, not only are animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) easy to digest, but they provide high-quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it's no wonder that our ancestors found a solution to the "protein problem" they used to have, almost in the same way as chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
A sleep interruption is when you deliberately wake up during your normal sleep period before falling asleep again shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a reasonably quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness without waking you completely.
If you reset the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Alternative options based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known diuretics) before going to sleep, so that you will have to get up to urinate.
There is a negative correlation between a person's inner peace and the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present. Every person has the ability to achieve complete peace and happiness.
Everyone can achieve insight. Nothing interferes with this goal except for the tension and negative attitude that might exist within ourselves.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is a very simple thing. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The Yoga Gods are the heart of Tibetan meditation. By visualizing three different deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and insight into wisdom is gained.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which encouraged cooperation between the USSR and the USA. However, with the end of the war, a disagreement arose between the countries due to the differences between them in terms of political system, process, and culture.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
He was to last for 40 years and the fight would really be done, with proxy weapons, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and several other places.
By 17 September 1939, Poland's defense had already been broken, the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans were almost overnight shelved when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and the front of Belarus and Ukraine was created after invading the eastern regions of Poland, which was a breach of the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Ships used to transport goods are by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional function of a navy is to ensure that your country can always move its people and goods, while at the same time hindering your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this recently was the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, was trying to stop that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to bring Britain under its control as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so that milk, fur, meat, and hides would be readily available to them.
Generally, goats were kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas, with goat herders often tending them, who were usually children or young people, similar to the shepherd as widely known. These herding methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although only parallel wooden boards were used in trackways, they enabled horses that were pulling to achieve better speed and pull larger loads on the routes that were slightly rougher.
The ties were introduced early enough to secure the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if there was an iron strip on top.
This became a common practice, but it was the iron that led to more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In the year 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking is the first mode of transport we know, people began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) came into existence.
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live in a way that is more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if a temporary solution is not enough, then we should find the root cause of the problems and resolve them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological developments of the human race, and that difficulties have increased due to overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of the human race.
After it was adopted by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to the print shop of John Dunlap, which was a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
It was John Nixon who first read this document publicly in the courtyard of the Hall of Freedom on the 8th of July.
One was sent to George Washington on the 6th of July, with orders for it to be read to his troops in New York on the 9th of July. A copy reached London on the 10th of August.
The 25 Dunlap broadsheets known to us to still exist are the oldest copies we have of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Some paleontologists currently believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. We call them birds.
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still very similar to dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Most computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, as they are referred to in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of potential poisoning is the presence of a container of a medicine or a household toxic chemical being there and it or them being open.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is the formal term used by entomologists for this group of bugs.
From the longstanding experience of humans with these creatures comes the term bedbug; they are insects adapted to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs and assassin bugs are parasitic insects adapted to living in the nest or dwelling place of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the most common neurological disease contracted by young and middle-aged adults.
MS disease affects the central nervous system, that is, the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has found that females are twice as likely to have MS as males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own best interest, nor in the best interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples have the option to make an adoption plan for their child.
To adopt a child, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main aim of science is to gain understanding through the scientific method of how the world works. It is this method that truly guides most scientific research.
But he is not alone, experimentation, and experimentation is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and recording an opinion are scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on every scientific question, including the psychological, would be accepted.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the countries of the West became separated from their roots in Greek philosophy and science.
Often, many familiar rhythms in physiology and behavior are heavily influenced by hormonal cues and their production through the body's clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues to cycle with a free-running period even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA was genetic material.
With bacteriophages, or viruses, Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments marking the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells alone can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the enjoyment of scenery, including wild plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Visiting orangutans in Borneo, taking photographs of them and learning about them is an example.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in their cars to go to their workplaces and pass others whose work destination is the place just left by the former group.
In this dynamic transport interchange, everyone is involved with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has driven the biosphere away from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
Usually, one does not hear as many complaints, in developed countries, about the quality of water or reports of bridges collapsing.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they fail on a daily basis? Is it because there aren't competent transport engineers? Or is there some more fundamental reason for it?
Traffic Flow focuses on the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and on the interactions between them.
It's bad to say that it's difficult to study traffic flow because it's not possible to fully predict driver behavior.
Fortunately, driver behavior usually falls within a range that is relatively stable; thus, relative stability is seen in traffic streams and they can be represented mathematically to a greater or lesser extent.
To provide a better representation of traffic flow, a relationship is established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship is helpful when planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to venture into the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back flat against their bodies.
That gives them a wider range of small places to hide themselves from predators.
Nowadays, every insect, except for the dragonfly and the Mayfly, can fold its wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many others believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't appear to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, measuring six miles in width in places.
20 percent of all the water that flows out of the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Water flows into it from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that pyramid construction continued in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and the excellent technical construction they represented.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, monuments that were over a thousand years old by then.
Around 800 people are in the population of Vatican City. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the daily language used by most of the people who work in the state, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every citizen of Vatican City is a Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have been aware of the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because all of these can be found in nature in their native form and it is relatively simple to extract them from mines with basic tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had a theory that everything is composed of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also had the theory that they transform into new substances to create what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are also metals like silver and gold, of course.
Alloys can also exist, which include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that there would be space for trillions of them in the full stop at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came on the market.
It is a pity that the pencil is not used as much now that new writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages on computer screens, with no need to use a typewriter.
One can only ask the question of what will happen to the keyboard when something fresher comes to the market.
The first fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Some of that energy is released when the nucleus is split again.
Certain atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to break apart with little or no friction.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 cm thick on the side closest to us and 100 km thick on the other side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for lava to come up to the surface.
Material theories focus on identifying the things that people need or the things they enjoy.
It is claimed in these theories that people have certain needs and/or desires which they internalize as they grow into adults.
These are theories that focus on why certain people want to do certain things and the things in their environment that would cause them to do certain things or not do them.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two common theories of motivation.
In general, two types of behavior may emerge as managers begin to provide leadership to their former peers. On one hand, the manager wants to remain "as one of the guys" (or girls).
It is difficult for this type of manager to make decisions, conduct disciplinary actions, assess performance, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable for things.
On the other side of the story, you could become an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must fundamentally change everything that the team used to practice, and impose your own way completely on it.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often causes conflict between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more independence than regular staff members because their teams might meet according to different time zones that their local management does not understand.
"The existence of an 'invisible real team' is also a unique part of a virtual team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109)."
The "invisible team" is the management team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization be eager to spend the time necessary to establish a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, a new innovation process that satisfies the customer's need may emerge from the organization's process of collaborating together to overcome an obstacle.
Before new ideas can be introduced, leaders must create a culture of innovation along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
In Angel (2006), the Contanaim approach is explained as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. This makes the field of research narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain epidemiology and behavior is a support for scientists in their research.
It has long been recognized that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions as a result.
The advent of new technologies enables us to investigate the structure and processes of the brain, never seen before.
It provides a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in the human mind.
Although AI gives a strong flavor of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
As examples, there are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer queries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things are now specific disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is often used now in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and weaponry, as it is now integrated into several software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. A teacher often wishes to take her students to places that cannot be visited on a bus trip.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a wonderful way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the website is revamped, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also be helpful in improving a student's writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with untidy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since the audience that is most critical are often students, the blog writer begins to try to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
On top of that, blogging "causes students to be more sensible about the world around them." It is the need to satisfy the interest of the audience that motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to enhance their learning outside of the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to enhance their analytical and critical skills; by actively responding to Internet content, students can express their own stance in the context of others' writings as well as set out their own views on certain subjects (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the elegant, bilingual capital of Canada, and you will find art galleries and museums there that portray Canada in the past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of the Muskoka and beyond.
With all that and more, Ontario is presented as the typical Canada in the opinion of strangers.
There are not many people living in large areas further north and some of it is wilderness that is almost uninhabited.
Here is a comparison of populations that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest and a territory in its own right in terms of wildlife.
The majority of the small islands are either independent nations or connected to France, and are recognized as luxurious holiday destinations.
The Arabs brought Islam to the lands, and it was eagerly embraced in the Comoros Islands and in Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, discovered the Cape Route, which is the Sea Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the Sahel surrounds the region, and in the south and west, there is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether they are or not.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but don't wear one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that what might be considered harassment could result from cultural differences and that it is common for someone to follow you, grab your limb, etc.
Be firm when rejecting a man's advances, and don't hesitate to stand your ground for yourself (even if cultural differences are involved, that doesn't make it right or fair!)
Berber fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca in the 10th century AD, and it was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was Spanish traders, who established trading posts there, that called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places in Morocco for shopping.
Around the old part of Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are for sale, such as the tagine, pottery, leather goods, the hookah, and a wide range of assorted trinkets, but it is all meant for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, research should be conducted before visiting outside of Goma to assess the state of ongoing conflict in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and it offers some of the cheapest opportunities to track the Mountain Gorilla in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~ 500 Congolese Francs for the short trip.
Because it is quite inaccessible as well, the word "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Timbuktu is a poor town today, although its fame is of interest to tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of world heritage sites that are endangered, due to the threat from desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on the special program by Henry Louis Gates on PBS, Wonders of the African World.
There is no similarity between this city and other cities of the country because it has an Arabic flavor rather than an African flavor.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeastern part of South Africa and is located along the Mozambique border in the east, along the Zimbabwe border in the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct eco-zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions that draws tourists and is considered the flagship park of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks in South Africa, daily fees are charged for conservation matters and park entry.
It is believed that it is worthwhile for a person to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to a choice of parks in South Africa or to every single one of the National Parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong is derived from the island of Hong Kong, and it is this place that many tourists focus on.
There are people who say that the parade of buildings on Hong Kong's skyline is like a splendid bar chart seen with reflections from the waters in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront facing Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban developments on Hong Kong Island are built on top of each other on reclaimed land along the east coast.
This is the place the British colonists took as their own and so if you want evidence of the frontier days when it was a colony, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans, the world's largest coastal mangrove zone, extend 80 km (50 miles) into the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is within the territory of India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These are not just mangrove bogs, however — they include some of the last remaining clumps of the immense rainforests that once covered the Plains of the Genesis.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², and roughly one third of it is wetlands/marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal Royal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area now.
Inter-district buses (across the river) leave the bus station throughout the day, but mostly, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, they leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Japanese-coach small buses, which are comfortable and sturdy, serve most areas.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers extend 83 meters towards the sky, it is 378 meters long, and there are two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned for the bridge to be fully operational by September 2017, when it is expected that Brazil's customs checkpoints will be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that lived in the area now known as Eastern Paraguay; they survived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
Other native tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing, also lived in the Chaco region.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was known as "The Great Province of the Indies," was established as a result of the conflict between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated the era of colonization, which lasted three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned as a country with one of the best polo teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Competitions and minor games can also be watched here at other times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and information on buying tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The Falkland Islands pound (FKP) is pegged at a value equal to the British pound (GBP), the official currency of the Falklands.
Money can be transferred in the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West shop.
Generally, the British pound is accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are usually accepted as well.
There is a risk that credit cards may not be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and United States currency might be accepted; ask the owners in advance what payment method will be acceptable.
It is almost impossible to use the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is on the southern side of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; it is not usual for the temperature to remain below +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be colder than you might think; temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but it feels colder than you might think from the thermometer when the wind and humidity come together.
There is no "rainy season" or "dry season": roughly the same amount of rain falls throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other types of wildlife!
No matter how calm they appear, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack people.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they did not keep a safe enough distance. These are large, wild animals and they can be dangerous, so they must be given their proper space.
Additionally, remember that certain smells attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook foods with strong odors and always keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
It was in this harbor that a notorious stand-off occurred in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
Every ship went to the bottom, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 people were lost, both Americans and Germans.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a crowd gathered peacefully in the village but the great chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed as a result.
There are many beaches because Auckland spans two harbors. The most popular ones are found in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and they stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded and there is a good range of shops near the beach. Swimming is safe there.
"Number One" is the favorite beer of the locals, it’s not a complex beer but it’s nice cold. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There are many French wines available to buy, but travel might affect them more than wines from Australia and New Zealand.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
If you are from Australia, the concept of 'flat white' coffee, or 'caife maolbhán', is foreign. A small black coffee is called 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of cream (not milk foam) on top, and milk is not served with tea.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Several trips are made to the quay throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these reasons on the quay are rare.
Nevertheless, take advice from the authorities, comply with all signs, and pay careful attention to safety warnings.
The bluebottle jellyfish is found near beaches and river mouths from October to April on the northern side of 1770. They are occasionally present outside of those times.
Although there are sharks, they are afraid of people and would rarely attack. Most of them would swim away out of fear.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If a place is booked in advance, it gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents can often make deals with specific hotels, though you might also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that cover breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport, or even flight and hotel packages together.
They can hold the reservation for you, too, if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any minor changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, most attendees at music festivals make the decision to camp on-site, and most attendees consider that to be a central part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to get in early to secure a campsite that's near the music.
Remember, although the music on the main stages may be over, music might be playing in parts of the festival until late at night.
Specific camping areas are available at certain festivals for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea from the North in winter, check the cabin's location, because when it passes through ice, it causes a terrible noise for those it affects most.
Some time is spent in the city during Saint Petersburg sea tours. Passengers on sea tours do not need to have a visa (see the terms).
Usually, every effort is made in casinos to maximize the time and money that guests spend there. Typically, there are no windows or clocks present, and it can be difficult to find the exits.
They usually have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and in the restaurant.
Free alcoholic drinks are offered in certain places. However, intoxication affects judgment, and every gambler knows how important it is to be in full control of your senses.
Anyone who will be driving in the high latitude or through mountain passes should consider the risk of snow, ice, or sub-freezing temperatures being involved.
On icy roads and roads covered with snow, little friction is obtained and it is not possible to drive as if you are on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that you could become trapped.
Falling or blowing snow, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows may limit visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is not affected much throughout the year.
The safari might be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Travel across the country to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially on the savannas, is the usual meaning of a safari.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a habit of approaching cars so that they can be easily viewed with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with glasses.
A walking safari (also known as "wilderness walk", "walking safari", or "footing") is hiking, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Certain events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, since they hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might have a difficult case.
There is variation among cancellation policies, but from the end of March onwards, in the case of most cancellation policies related to coronavirus, no extension is given until July 2020, the time planned for the Olympics.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a regular ticket costing ¥7,000.
Damp clothes can be dried by ironing them. Many hotels have an ironing board and an iron, even if one is not present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you are not keen on wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric become too hot (which could cause shrinking, or in worse cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil water for a minute, and in other places a few minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Tourists may have to deal with pests unfamiliar to them in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Usually, contagious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods in certain places without paying taxes or duties on them.
Travelers heading to countries with high tax rates can save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging driving conditions can be found on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway in the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often passes through remote land.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep calm: they mostly consist of steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are much lower than in previous and subsequent sections — usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is more important than ever that we fully comply with them.
Strangely enough, however, the mobile phone service here is stronger than it is in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite tasty, and in Bavaria they are rather rich and varied, similar to those made in their neighboring country to the south, Austria.
Fruit cakes are commonly available, with baked apples in them throughout the year, and cherries and plums can be found in them during the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts are part of some German baked goods. Popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you like some cakes that are small but rich, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, names they are called depending on the region.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used with curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions in the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that covers a wide range of regional cooking styles found throughout the country.
But, if no additional qualifiers are used, generally the term means that the food originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cooking is now widely available throughout the archipelago in the form of a range of simply flavored dishes. The favorite flavoring among the Javanese people is ground nuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, and they hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but people may be concerned about them because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot is caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots that have heels and soles that are smooth and fairly narrow.
Afterwards, there are safety bars on certain saddles, especially English saddles, through which the leather of a stirrup can drop from the saddle if a rider falling back pulls it.
Cochamó Valley - the best place in Chile for climbers, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of big walls and granite rocks.
On the summits, you will get views from peaks that will take your breath away. Climbers from all over are constantly finding new routes amidst the limitless possibilities of the walls.
Slope snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which people slide down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to their feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity, and many people are very devoted to it, people sometimes referred to as "ski bums," who plan an entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing is an ancient idea — skiers are depicted in cave paintings that date back as far as 5000 B.C.!
As a sport, skiing downhill dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking ski tour: This activity is also referred to as backcountry skiing, cross-country skiing, or ski touring.
It is related, but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountain climbing, the latter done on steep ground and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
If the weather is good, you will be able to go further than you would on foot - but you will rarely achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on a prepared trail.
Europe is a fairly small continent but it has a lot of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would force a person to apply for visas and go through passport controls repeatedly.
The Schengen Area functions, in this respect, as if it were one country.
Provided that you stay in this area, in general you can cross borders without needing to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to make a separate application for a visa to any of the Schengen member countries, and therefore you save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes manufactured goods as antiquities. The definition that some tax agencies have for antiquities is goods that are more than 100 years old.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where the age limit might be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted items could be recognized as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture associated with the trade is also important for people who have other careers.
Even traditionally, however, not all the Sámi were engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they lived by fishing, hunting, and doing similar things, and reindeer were mainly used as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
The word "Giofóg" is widely used but, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Giofóg" is often considered a slur due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you plan to visit is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to get advice from a government other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens might have to deal with different circumstances in the Middle East compared to a European or Arab case.
A consultative report is just a brief summary of the political circumstances in one country.
The opinions that are presented are often general, oversimplified, and in summary compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a generic term for any kind of hazardous weather phenomenon that could cause damage, disrupt life, or endanger people's lives.
Adverse weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are various types of it, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hailstones, heavy rainfall, and mountain fires are effects of bad weather, along with thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include snow drift, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any adverse weather risks in the area they are in, as it could make a difference to travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
If you do an Internet search for 'Course in a hostile environment' there is a good chance that the address of a local organization will be provided.
Usually, the course covers all the subjects discussed here, but they are dealt with in much greater detail, and practical experience is usually provided.
A course usually lasts between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines discussing survival in the wild are commonly available, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Tourists planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for the journey home.
Not every government is equally willing to issue a passport without specifying gender (X) on it or to provide an updated document to include the chosen name and gender.
There is the same variation in how willing foreign governments are to respect these documents.
Searches at security checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to go through scanners without any intrusion on their privacy or dignity.
Backwash currents are the flow that returns from waves breaking and flowing out from the shore, often at a reef or the like.
Due to the underwater topography, the folded flow is directed at some parts that are deeper, and a rapid current to deep water can be created there.
The majority of deaths occur because of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the waterfall, something that might have been possible.
Swimming back is no harder than usual, but first escape the current.
Try to focus in a place you were not born, or depending on your skill level and whether you were noticed, it might be better to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock begins earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Sometimes it is very difficult for travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture to readjust to returning to their native culture.
When you return after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt themselves.
It is possible that people will not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light pyramid show is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, the sound of tourists and vendors can be heard here. The story of the sound and the light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator in the long story.
The scenes of the pyramids are often shown and various pyramids are lit up.
More than one nation claims that South Shetland is its territory, which was first discovered in 1819. The largest number of bases on the islands was sixteen, which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the Peninsula. King George Island, which is the location of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest island.
Livingston Island and Deception Island are other examples, where the caldera submerged by a still active volcano creates a wonderful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region from the southern part of the Peninsula, with the Bellingshausen Sea as its boundary.
The mountains of the Peninsula are concealed in the plateau here, before being seen again in the form of the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km range separated by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or in the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, of which Mount Vinson with a height of 4892 m is the highest peak.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, the satellite phone might be your only option.
Generally, a satellite phone does not directly replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
Among the groups that frequently use this service are ships, including pleasure boats, as well as journeys with remote data and remote call requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
Among those planning a year break, the option to travel and learn is becoming more popular.
Many school leavers choose to do this, it gives them a year off before going to university, without interrupting their education.
In many cases, if you enroll in a course during a gap year abroad, you could improve your chances of entering higher education when you return to your home country.
A tuition fee is usually charged to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful place for boating. This is the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" which also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the islands and the lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed quite large for any yacht, a different experience can be gained in smaller boats than that, or even in a kayak.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is in line with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is unique in every other way (e.g., the figure is between ten and forty in the Netherlands).
A long visit to Saint Petersburg in Russia is part of most Baltic Cruises.
That means you can spend a couple of full days in the historic city and return to sleep on the ship at night.
If you enter only using voyages on board a ship, you would not require a separate visa (since 2009).
Berlin, in Germany, is seen in brochures of some cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to any sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can instill fear in people regardless of their age or background, especially if it is their first flight or if they have had trauma before.
You should not be ashamed of it: it is no different than the fear and personal hatred that many people have for other things.
For some people, if they gain an understanding of how aircraft work and what happens during flight, it may help them overcome a fear based on the unknown, or on not being in control of something.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is money, and it is very important to receive business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs in a timely manner.
The largest companies have their own planes on certain routes, but there was an issue with other routes and smaller businesses.
If they sent things by plane, in some ways they might have been waiting days to get through with unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The sure way to fly first class or business class is to pay a large amount of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general guide, you might expect to pay up to four times more than the economy rate for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth wasting your time looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights going from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of fliers who are willing to pay dearly for the advantage of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are accordingly charged the appropriate fees.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. Romanian is the language of the local people, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
In the year 1994, as a result of this conflict, the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria was created in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic links have been re-established between these two areas of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiation.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
It was once the ancient city of Smyrna, but now it is a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, situated around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Roofs of traditional red tiles, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and old churches can be seen here and there among the wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and the modern shopping center, though the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvik, views can be had out onto the nearby island of Eysturoy, and there is an unusual octagonal church there.
In the graveyard, on some tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It was worth spending half an hour going around the truly interesting village.
North and quite close to it is the interesting romantic town of Sintra, which started attracting attention from foreigners after Lord Byron praised its charm to the skies.
The Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
And also to the north, visit the Great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), a place that is famous worldwide because of the apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a massive grave site, a location that holds immense significance for a substantial portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many others who were murdered or killed by the work of people related to them, Jews and non-Jews alike.
You are asked to treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make a mockery of the Holocaust or of the Nazis.
Do not damage the site by placing or writing graffiti on the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half of the population speaks Catalan, most understand it, and very few people do not speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are displayed in Catalan only because it is legally established as the first official language.
Even so, Spanish is widely used in the public transportation system and in other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made in Catalan only, but in the case of unplanned disruptions, an automated system announces it in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, brusque, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to deal with the people of Paris is still to conduct yourself well, like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will be much easier to get around if you do that.
Parisians will lose their brusque appearance if you are polite to them.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by forest, mainly beech, spruce, and pine trees, and there is a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkably wide range of plant species, due to the numerous microclimates, various soils, and different altitude levels.
A great variety of animal and bird species can also be found in this area.
Uncommon wildlife such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species.
And when visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also wear a covering over their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries provide wimples for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, you'll receive a big smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are asked to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can be borrowed, too, from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed every time they are worn and so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits men!
Mallorcan food is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (specifically pork) and olive oil is used all the time, as is typical in similar areas of the Mediterranean region.
A simple dinner that is very popular, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun that accompanies the word Sie meaning 'you' is started with a capital letter even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between verbs and certain objects.
One could say that reading is also easier because of it, although the writing is quite complex due to the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in the substantive form.
The pronunciation of Italian is relatively easy because every word is pronounced exactly as it is written.
It is necessary to watch out for the letters c and g above all other letters because their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Also make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, but carro means car.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and mostly regular.
So, it would help you learn a lot about Irish grammar and gain a better understanding of phrases by just reading this basic grammar book.
It goes without saying, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may quickly come to the opinion that Portuguese is similar enough that there is no need to study it on its own.
There are few observatories from the pre-modern era still in use today, most are museums or educational sites.
Because there was no problem with light pollution back when they were at the height of their power, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, and are more easily accessible than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
It is part of Japanese culture from the 8th century to view the blooming of cherry trees, known as hanami.
The concept came from China, where the blossoms of the plum tree are the chosen flower.
In Japan, the emperor did not host the first cherry blossom parties except for himself and other members of the elite around the Imperial Court.
Plants look good in their natural environment, so do not give in to the temptation to take even "one specimen".
If you visit a formally organized garden, you will be expelled without discussion if you are collecting "specimens."
Singapore is usually a very safe place and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything there while you are there.
Because it is located in the "high tropics" however, a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (constantly) and with strong sunlight (if the sky is clear, not so often).
Some buses go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Biblical patriarchs, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take is going into Hebron, and not only to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba nearby.
Inland waterways could be a good theme when establishing a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or going on a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or embarking on boating along the Erie Canal.
They lay out routes used for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday are followed by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of not sleeping a wink on Easter night and spending the night at some exposed point waiting to see the sunrise.
Of course, Christians have a theological explanation for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Easter Vigil is often held at a more traditional church on Holy Saturday night during Easter weekend, with the crowd frequently beginning celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
All the animals that reached the islands initially arrived there by swimming, flying, or by floating.
Because the mammals could not go there since the distance from the mainland was too far for them, the giant tortoise managed to become the primary grazing animal in the Galápagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be almost dark day and night.
Because those regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is not often a problem there as a result, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners would be used to.
Standard business attire consists of suits, and workers use family names or job titles when addressing each other.
There is nothing more important than compromise in the workplace, where emphasis is placed on group effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers often have to obtain permission from their superior officer for any decision they make, and they are expected to carry out the orders of their superior officer without any objection.
