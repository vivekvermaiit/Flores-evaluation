Although an experimental vaccine has been shown to reduce mortality from Ebola, so far no drug has been proven suitable for treating an existing infection.
The antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in this field. However, official studies indicated that it had fewer than desired benefits in preventing death.
In the PALM clinical trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning that scientists used it as the baseline and compared the remaining three drugs to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that it is in the greater interest of our athletes and clubs and their sports to progress within our organization, with meaningful changes, rather than the dissolution of the organization.

This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but details that fossils usually do not provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement, are enabled.
Scientists claim that the upper side of this animal's feathers was chestnut brown, while the underside was pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed feather shaft called the rachis, but have other feather features — barbs of the first and second order — researchers concluded that the shaft likely developed later in evolution compared to those other features.
According to the structure of the feathers, it can be concluded that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers claim that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult coloring feathers, not juvenile down.
The research has shown that despite it being the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample is part of feathers of an adult bird's color, not chick fluff.
A car bomb exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.
The governor's office reports that among the injured were nineteen police officers.
The police stated that they suspect the person responsible for the attack is an alleged member of the militant group Daesh (ISIL).
They discovered that the same basic principles that govern the Sun also govern other stars: it was revealed that the activity of all stars in the system is determined solely by their luminosity and rotation.
The Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, is determined using luminosity and rotation.
The smaller the Rossby number, the lower the star's activity in terms of magnetic reversal.

The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was supposed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was striving for is caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way pulls the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have proven that dark matter interacts with each other in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around galaxies forms a kind of halo around the galaxy which consists of a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant is "very concerning and alarming" due to the very high mortality rate.
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have become ill during their stay in the hospital, and at least two more were healthcare workers.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB cases in the population affected by tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 patients, the number of people suffering from tuberculosis at any given time in South Africa.

"The warmth of the caves is not as uniform as that of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent given that they are large openings in the ground," says Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, traditionally, high technology is not used during voting: voters are isolated in booths, where they insert a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly prescribed by the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added to them except those inserted by properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In her second, giant slalom race, she finished in tenth place in women's sitting skiing with a combined time of 4:41.30 – 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers from the women's group failed to complete the course, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Giant slalom did not manage to qualify in the race.
The police of the state of Madhya Pradesh have found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D K Arya stated, "We have arrested five individuals suspected of raping a female from Switzerland and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused came to court with covered faces.
Although there were three people in the house when it was hit by a car, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
In the beginning, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been on trial at the Edinburgh's first-instance court charged with the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting an indictment and trial, but there is a possibility that eyewitness evidence will be derivative as many media outlets have published her photograph.
It is an established practice throughout the United Kingdom, but the judiciary in Scotland operates differently and the courts considered the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are walking a dangerous tightrope due to the publication of photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which conducts all criminal proceedings, announced to reporters that it will not provide further comments at least until the indictment is issued.
The document will, according to leaked information, relate to the border dispute, for which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics allegedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continuous military presence for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
Hunters in the trial hunt aimed at controlling pests would be under the strict supervision of park rangers who would monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the hunt.
Qualified volunteers have been recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, as part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected to carry out the first culling operation have been given extensive safety guidelines and have undergone training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission cited the previous resignation of the CEO as part of the package of measures towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections that were supposed to have been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods that overheated have been reported, causing six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that Apple informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company considers "not serious."
The ministry called Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists captive by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired a shot at tourists from his M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an older woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He is trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that the use of hormones accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two flight data recorders from the "black box" on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman.""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnells stated, "Luna was as eccentric as I am, if not more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she has gone to a better place."
Out of 1,400 respondents before the federal elections in 2010, the number of those opposing the proposal for Australia to become a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants share the same view and believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 m freestyle races and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, his health is in question.
He could not take painkillers because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known as of January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of the formation of water on Earth, along with organic substances that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, with which comets collided long ago.
Cuomo's (53) mandate began earlier this year, and the governor signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
It is assumed that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would shorten aircraft flight routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike the older technology based on radars, this system uses satellite technology so that air traffic controllers can locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport options will be organized, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Also, facilities for vehicle parking and park and ride services will not be available.
Due to fears of a lack of transport, there is a possibility that the match would have to be moved indoors without fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species developed within just two generations, although it was believed that this process takes much longer, due to the crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant from the finch genus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all possible forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and stick to another metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called chemical pH. A possible indicator for you could be red cabbage juice.
The brine changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the abbreviation pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together the two dry powders, then press them into a ball with clean wet hands.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tickle you and cause the formation of a cocoon.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, every house was equipped with at least one flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the buildings of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled in society.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists in space use a telescope because Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and views.
To send a satellite or a telescope into space, a huge rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has brought unimaginable changes to the world. The biggest change was that the invention of the wheel made transportation much easier and faster for us.
It enabled the invention of the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, many small cats (including house cats) eat a much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche concept, that is, the special position occupied by an individual cat, so it does not have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull five times with the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a series of incomprehensible, shouted words.
Ocelots eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and locate animals they eat (prey) by smell, by sniffing where the prey has moved on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark using night vision and move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with the environment and then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (for example, during crossing over a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
A new environment means different resources and different competition, so the new population requires features or adaptations that differ from the previous ones in order to be able to compete for resources.
The original population has not changed at all; they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it increasingly resembles the other population less.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much in appearance that they will not be able to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale and then take in carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants produce food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We make houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The mosasaur was the main predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw had more than 70 sharp teeth along with an additional set on the palate, which meant there was no help for anyone who crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but it's possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he might have been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would not have been its match.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or uncommon delicacies, which included wild boar, peacocks, snails, and dormice.
The other difference was that the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, while wealthy men enjoyed joint feasts where they would dine reclining on their sides.
Meals of the ancient Romans could not contain ingredients that reached Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they did not know corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids shaped towers, known as ziggurats, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine of God.
In the warm climatic conditions of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the lives of Hebrew families took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were counters open to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas tell how Erik the Red, after being exiled from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way west and gave it its name.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
"Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland."
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it read "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Nobody knows for certain who wrote this large document on parchment (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches), but it is known that shortly after it was made, it was rolled up for storage.
So, that record was probably added simply as a label.
The landings as part of D-Day and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
The French from "Vichy France" ruled there. They were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked together with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France. The attack is known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced toward Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together – society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and it relates to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the size of a society in some way.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, an imprint in culture, and equal dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, so we do not recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states by the constitutional act Articles of Confederation first established a weak central government that consisted only of Congress.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no executive or judicial authority, it relied on competent bodies for the implementation of all acts, which often did not cooperate.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and customs between states.
To amend the Treaty, the unanimous consent of all states was required, and the states did not take the central authority seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German one, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the champions at the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Since it consists of a cluster (group) of islands, Japan, from the viewpoint of the field of geography, is often called an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan begins as early as the 15th century, when European sailors during their voyages past the island recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan and began transforming the indigenous practices in grain production, employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) forcibly took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 - 1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, granting Japan sovereignty over Taiwan, which was governed by Japan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better introduction to how they originally came about.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, the same ratio is found in image sensor formats in digital cameras.
It's somewhat confusing that the 35-millimeter format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The width-to-height ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the ratio expressed in simple whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, formats from the APS group) are equal to or closest to this image width-to-height ratio.
The rule of thirds, often broken and mocked, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church became the subject of criticism.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has connected European countries that had different languages and customs.
The great power of Christianity influenced everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used for the purpose of alleviating suffering and reducing poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being adhered to.
Shortly after the outbreak of armed conflict, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, which posed a danger to the ships of neutral parties as well.
Considering that there was not much interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a pacifist attitude and separation prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities during World War I, people wanted to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at Edison’s company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation addressed to Thomas Edison by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous workplace).
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a recognizable dynasty.
Between each dynasty followed an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars unfolded among the nobility in the struggle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China; thousands of people died fighting for the highest position in the grand palace of Xi’an.
The consequences are of a social and political nature, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not the ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, employment was available to all men and the most ambitious and successful were given the opportunity for success.
The same goes for the military because, after the revolution, ranks were awarded based on ability, not social class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was very interested in questions beyond the bounds of his boring life. He visited the cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) so that he could think better.
The cave that has endured through history provides a clear image of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it is not easy to find even if you know for sure that it exists. Once you find yourself in the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.
The Pyramid of Cheops, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis in Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and a multitude of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The notation for "up-bow" looks like a V, and "down-bow" is like a paperclip or a square without the bottom side.
The sign for up means to start from the top and push the bow, while the sign for down means to start from the frog (where we hold the bow with our hand) and pull the bow.
A raised bow usually creates a softer sound, while a lowered bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the bow movement markings are printed for musical reasons and should generally be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Elizabeth were forced by a crowd of women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, in front of the horrified queen, a member of the mob brandished the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds was channeled through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofit resulting from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos will constitute the basic profit of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order was founded.
We usually refer to this period as the High Middle Ages, which is a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 – 1300 AD).
The developed High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impetus or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is guided by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the invention of the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network throughout the entire country is not worthwhile for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the discovery of new techniques in healthcare for treating injuries.
In Romanticism, there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time customs and culture related to geography emerge that align with the physical dwelling of society, and are therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of luxury from 400 AD to approximately 1100 AD.
The status deteriorated in the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that had greater value than what the Byzantine market offered.
During this time, the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style was from the 10th to the 11th century and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest discoveries of that era as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons on clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture aimed at producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds indigenous to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, which still holds true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the methods most commonly used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to provide examples of unfortunate cases of children who did not undergo socialization by adults during their upbringing, whether as a consequence of neglect, accidents, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called uncultivated or wild. Some wild children are imprisoned by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, the abandonment of a child is a result of parents refusing to accept that their child has severe intellectual or psychological impairments.
Feral children may experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are presumed to have been raised by animals, and some are reportedly said to have lived in the wild on their own.
If he was completely raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of the human body) that are almost entirely like those of the animal that raised him, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although learning on a project should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not an educational method, but support for individuals facing a new learning experience, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, as well as the animated paperclip that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
The virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended for testing, directing, and explaining procedures that may be too challenging for the student to solve on their own.
Children are placed in the foster care system for various reasons, from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, yet it still happens.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is required to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should meet all the needs that are lacking in the home from which they are taken.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motives for using the internet (James et al., 1995.).
During their research on visitors' reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recordings has enabled important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to discern if a certain person is lying through proper interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, claims that people who cannot understand speech due to brain injury can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He hinted that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: concealed and expressed.
A mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shift variability between these two sources.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
In fact, failure has serious consequences: reduced growth, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest uncooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also contains large amounts of protein that includes all essential amino acids.
"All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved the 'protein intake question' in almost the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah do today."
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during a normal sleep period and then going back to sleep shortly after (10 – 60 minutes).
This is possible by simply using a relatively quiet alarm clock to become conscious without fully waking up.
If you realize that you turn off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm options include consuming a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, which forces you to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can experience enlightenment. The only things standing in our way to that goal are our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but is expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga awakens the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Divine yoga is at the center of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, differences in systems, practices, and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would be led by truly empowered armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defense had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans failed almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered Poland and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of the eastern Polish regions, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ship is certainly the most efficient way for a large number of people and a large quantity of goods to cross the ocean.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean to assist the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would likely have managed to conquer Britain, as it succeeded with the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and they were tended by so-called goat herds, typically children or adolescents, which is the name for shepherds who watch over goats. These herding methods are still used today.
Tracks for carts drawn by horses were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden tracks for wagons consisted only of parallel-arranged planks, they allowed horses pulling the wagons to achieve greater speed and haul larger loads than would have been possible on the somewhat bumpier roads of that era.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails could be more efficient with iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
In the end, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. The first completely iron tracks were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and people started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal walking appears in australopithecines around 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even be activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, it is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not looking for a solution that is only temporary, we must find the root of these problems and neutralize them.
It is obvious that the world has changed significantly thanks to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and the problems are growing due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After the Congress adopted the handwritten draft on July 4th, signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, it was then sent a few streets away to the printer John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made that are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
25 known Dunlap copies that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten version has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many do not perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many features of birds resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers in use today are based on handling information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container with medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for special first aid instructions pertaining to that poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in the official sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the well-known bedbugs, insects that have very effectively adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and common bed bugs depend on their hosts, in whose nests or living spaces they reside.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the likelihood of developing multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
Such couples may give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method is essentially a guideline for most scientific research.
Besides that method, experimenting or experiments that serve as tests to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and observing also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, have been accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West severed ties with Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not just a response to external cyclical stimuli, have been discovered in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to maintain free-running cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading proposals that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments that pointed to DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are part of the germ line.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts individuals who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and travel by car to their workplace while passing by those whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation scenario, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the traffic system based on private cars.
Science now states that this bulky carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rare.
Why are transportation systems the cause of so many complaints; why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something much bigger at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave relatively consistently, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
For a better representation of traffic flow, connections between the three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them easier escape from predators and more efficient finding of food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along their bodies.
This allows them a larger number of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
Several thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many were convinced otherwise - that the Solar System, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That seems reasonable because we don't have a sense that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the collapse of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the pyramids at Giza.
The Ancient Egyptians from the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is made up of one or a mixture of more than four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized about them changing into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil thus became a close companion to a large number of people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the pen has lost its status and is used less and less frequently.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they don't even need a pencil sharpener.
We can only assume what will happen to the keyboard when something new emerges.
A fission bomb operates on the principle of deriving energy by assembling a nucleus with numerous protons and neutrons.
It's roughly like pushing a heavy cart uphill. By splitting the core, some of that energy is released again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with a slight push or without any push.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the nearer side and 100 km on the farther side.
It is thinner in the area of the lunar seas and thicker in the highland areas.
On the near side, there might be more dark areas because the crust is thinner. Lava reached the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
Those theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturation and growing up.
These theories examine what prompts some people to want what they want and which phenomena in the environment encourage them to do or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start managing former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum, there are attempts to remain "part of the team."
This type of leader encounters difficulties when making unpopular decisions, undertaking disciplinary measures, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who thinks they have to change everything the team has done so far and do it their own way.
The team leader is ultimately the one who is responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often leads to a gap between leaders and others.
Virtual teams should adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Members of virtual teams often represent the point of contact to the nearest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than traditional team members because their teams may meet in different time zones, which local management might not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'Invisible Team' represents a leadership team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member."
Why would an organization go through the lengthy process of re-establishing a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
After efficiently utilizing all available resources across all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come to the fore.
As a result, the process of an organization that seeks to overcome an obstacle through collaboration can lead to a new innovative process for fulfilling customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuous approach as a method by which organizations can achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognition research. This makes the research area narrower and much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior confirms scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
It provides us with a wealth of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it constitutes a very important branch of information sciences that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and the recognition of handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the economy, medicine, construction, and military because they are integrated into some software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a significant part of every class. Often, the teacher would gladly take her students to places for which travel by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual tours. Students can view exhibits in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual sharing of the trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the site changes every year, but old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. When they start blogging, students often make grammar and spelling mistakes, but the presence of an audience usually corrects that.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them." The need to engage the audience inspires them to be inventive and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to transfer learning beyond the traditional school.
"The appropriate use of blogs "can encourage students to engage in analytical and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their standpoint in the context of others' writings and present their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming capital city of Canada and offers a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Slightly further south are the Niagara Falls, while the north is home to untouched natural beauty in the Muskoka region and beyond.
Because of all these things, foreigners perceive Ontario as quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further to the north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost dominated by uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of population that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to the plant and animal world.
Most smaller islands are independent nations or have ties with France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, which took deep root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that women traveling say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women must understand that cultural differences can result in something that might be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab them by the hand, etc.
Firmly reject men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (it's not right regardless of cultural differences!).

The Portuguese destroyed the town and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tajines, pots, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of knickknacks, but all of that is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the nature of the conflicts occurring in the North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers some of the most affordable gorilla trekking options in Africa.
To tour Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used today as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport, Timbuktu is now an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the main places where Henry Louis Gates stopped during the filming of the PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is the polar opposite of other cities in the country as it has more elements of the Arab world than the African world.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with its southern boundary formed by the Crocodile River.
The area of the park covering 19,500 km² is divided into 14 different ecozones, and each of them is home to a different species of wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading South African national park (SANParks).
As in other South African national parks, it is necessary to pay daily conservation fees and entrance tickets.
Someone could also benefit from buying a joker card that allows entry to certain parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is a major hub for many tourists.
The exhibition of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong is comparable to a shimmering bar chart, which is even more noticeable thanks to the sea in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This place was occupied by British colonizers, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last places of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Valley.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by aquatic and swampy areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer now reside there.
Buses depart all day from the intercity bus station (across the river), but most, especially those headed east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese buses of the Toyota Coaster brand are used, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and pleasant way to travel to nearby places, such as the towns of Paro (150 Nu.) and Punakha (200 Nu.).
A suspension bridge spans the Oyapock River. The bridge over the Oyapock River connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was opened for traffic in March 2017.
The opening of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous community settled in what is now eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
After the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous population in the 16th century, Paraguay was formed, previously known as the "Great Province of the Indies."
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization lasting three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely succeeded in maintaining its indigenous character and identity.
The Argentine national team and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo's website.
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but they might accept British and American currency; inquire in advance with the owners to find out the acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures of +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no specifically 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of rain is generally the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human visits, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park management's instructions, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they failed to keep the appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking strongly scented foods, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
An infamous naval battle took place in the port in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, the murder of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III occurred during a peaceful gathering in the city.
As there are two harbors in Auckland, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches on the northern shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the coast of the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, it is safe to swim there, and many of them are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a large array of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is called "Number One". The beer is not complex, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines you have to try, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might suit you better.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are cautious, you will easily find bottled water.
The term "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino has a lot of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on the level of Belgian. The fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries due to any of the mentioned causes are rare.

Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river estuaries north of the town of 1770 from October to April. Sometimes they appear in other months as well.
Sharks exist, but they often attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance takes a load off the traveler's back because they know they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, organized transport to/from the airport, or even combination flight and hotel packages.
I can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents necessary for reaching the destination (e.g., a visa).
However, all changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants camp at the festival site, and most of them consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you will need to arrive early to secure a spot.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with young children.
If you travel through the northern Baltic in winter, be careful when choosing a cabin, as passing through the ice creates a terrible noise that is more audible in certain cabins.
Cruises of St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on the cruise do not need a visa (check conditions).
Casinos usually strive to maximize the amount of time and money guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to maintain the guests' good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness reduces one's ability to make judgments, and all good gamblers are aware of how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who drives at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or below-freezing temperatures.
On icy roads and roads covered with snow, there is little traction and you cannot drive as if you are on clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short period of time for you to get stuck in it.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow or snow carried by the wind, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, but traffic generally takes place without interruption throughout the year.
A safari is probably the biggest draw for tourists in Africa and the best experience for numerous visitors.
The term safari in everyday use refers to a land journey aimed at observing awe-inspiring African wildlife, especially in the savannas.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to the car, and a good view is possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "walking safari") consists of walking that lasts from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, the host of the 1964 games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the 2020 Games before they were postponed, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus have not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing. Many hotels will rent you an iron and ironing board even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can lead to shrinking or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are different ways of purifying water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to let the water boil for one minute, while in others, it is necessary for several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you have concerns, buy water in sealed bottles from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not accustomed to in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, transmit poison, or infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through the use of force are usually not classified as plagues.
Shopping in duty-free stores presents an opportunity to purchase products exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can save a significant amount of money, especially when buying alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be prepared for anything: steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp turns prevail.
The prescribed speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections, usually 35-40 mi/h (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the limits is more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, the mobile service here is better than on many other road sections, e.g., Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good and diverse in Bavaria, just like with their southern neighbors, the Austrians.
Common desserts made from dough with fruit include those with apples, which are added to desserts year-round, and cherries and plums, which are used in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. A cup of strong coffee often complements popular cakes well.
If you crave small but generous bites, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be "dry" or "wet."
Yogurt is a common ingredient in curries in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines across the country.
But, if used without further additions, the term refers to food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago, comprising a range of simply seasoned dishes that feature the favorite flavors of Java's residents, including peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are footrests for the rider that hang from both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but also include certain safety risks as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from the horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse could drag them if it runs away. To reduce the risk, certain safety measures should be taken.
First, most drivers wear boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, contain safety bars that allow the stirrup strap to detach from the saddle if pulled backward by the rider during a fall.
Cochamó Valley is a primary climbing destination in Chile, also known as the South American Yosemite due to its diverse range of large granite cliffs and crags.
From the peaks, breathtaking views extend. Climbers from all parts of the world constantly establish new routes among the endless possibilities it offers.
Snow sports involving downhill descents, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snowy slope using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity, and many people known as "skiing enthusiasts" plan their vacations around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational skiing club.
Backpacking with skis on your back is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although it usually does not involve them. Mountaineering typically takes place on steep terrain and requires sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail as being similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than by walking, but you will very rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it consists of numerous independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean applying for a visa multiple times and going through passport control.
The Schengen zone, however, functions as one country in this regard.
As long as you are in that zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country individually, which saves time, money, and reduces the amount of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of an antique. Some tax authorities define an antique as goods older than 100 years.
There are geographical differences in the definition, so the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be called antiques even though they were made later than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami people, and the culture associated with trading is also significant for many people of other professions.
However, traditionally, not all members of the Sámi people were engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer primarily used for hauling.
Today, many Sámi people are involved in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region, Sápmi.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are traveling to ends up on the list of countries for which a warning has been issued, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You can consult with other governments besides your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The tips are a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The expressed views are often brief, general, and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is a generic term for any phenomenon of dangerous weather with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world in various forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hailstorms, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of hazardous weather conditions, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather phenomena include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are advised to be aware of the potential risk of bad weather in their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
If you do an internet search with the keywords "hostile environment course," you will find the address of a local company.
The course generally covers in more detail all the issues discussed here, usually with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many lessons related to first aid, and sometimes firearm handling training.
Many books and magazines deal with survival in the wilderness, but publications that cover war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid documents for their return.
The willingness to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies from government to government.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect such documents also varies from government to government.
Searches at checkpoints have also become more drastic in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery are unlikely to pass through the scanner without a violation of privacy and dignity.
The rip current is the backwash of waves that break on the shore, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underground topology, the backflow is concentrated on a pair of deeper parts, and it is possible for a swift current to form towards greater depths.
Death mostly occurs when a person becomes exhausted trying to swim against the current, which is often impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to swim in a way that the current does not catch you again, or, depending on your skills and whether someone has spotted you, you can wait for help.
The shock of returning to one's own culture occurs before the cultural shock. The honeymoon phase is shorter, the shock lasts longer, and it can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their native one.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits that belong to your own culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are necessary when travelers return to their home.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Usually, the sounds of tourists and traders can be heard. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx plays the role of the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases – sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, which is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of a yet active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The Ellsworth Land region is south of the island, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains here merge into plateaus, then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range lie the highest Antarctic mountains, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Vinson at 4,892 m.
In remote locations where there is no signal coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you have to make calls outdoors and the satellite must be in your line of sight to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, on recreational vessels, as well as on expeditions that require remote data and voice transmission.
Your telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among those leaving school as it allows them to take a gap year before college without compromising their education.

There is usually a tuition fee for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
For archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for yacht sailing, riding smaller boats or kayaking offer a completely different experience.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, which has one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
A similar situation exists in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands that number is one in forty).
Most famous Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you travel to the mainland on shore excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures also include Berlin in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: it is no different from the fears and aversions many people feel towards some other things.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for quickly delivering shipments. Time is often of utmost importance when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but the problem arose with other routes and smaller companies.
If the cargo were sent by air, unloading and customs procedures on some routes would take days.
The only way to get through it faster is to send things as checked baggage. According to the airline's rules, baggage cannot travel without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
It is understood that you will be able to fly first or business class if you set aside a thick wad of cash for that privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: generally speaking, expect it to cost up to four times more than the usual economy class seat price, that is, eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in seeking discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that a certain group of passengers is willing to pay a large sum of money for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The language of the population is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has faced ethnic conflicts.
That conflict in 1994 led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The Orthodox faith is the majority religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is the second largest port after Istanbul and a very well-connected transportation hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna (Izmir) today is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center surrounded by mountains, which lies around a vast gulf.
Wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with classic red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík you can see the nearby island of Eysturoy, which is also home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above certain tombs.
It is worth taking a half-hour walk through the intriguing village.
To the north lies the easily accessible, romantic, and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after the brilliant depiction of its beauties written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Altar), a site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please note that you are visiting a mass grave site that holds almost immeasurable significance for a considerable portion of the world's population.
There are still a large number of men and women who survived it, as well as those whose loved ones were killed there or worked to death, whether they were Jewish or not.
Treat this place with the dignity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place with painted or carved graffiti on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
Yes, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other infrastructure.
Regular announcements in the metro are in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced via an automated system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are reputed to be rude and arrogant egocentrics.
Although it is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is by behaving nicely, that is, behaving like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will significantly ease your stay.
The aloof exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic kindness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, with beech, spruce, and fir trees being the most common. The park is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The park is home to an especially wide range of plant communities thanks to the different microclimates, soil types, and variations in altitude within the park.
Extremely diverse species of animals and birds live in that area.
Rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and clothing that covers the shoulders.
Most monasteries have coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own covering, especially in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover the knees.
You can borrow them at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each visitor, so you might not feel comfortable wearing them. Sizes are universal!
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar Mediterranean zones, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
Pa amb Oli is a favorite simple dish that is especially eaten in the summer: it is bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any toppings at hand, such as cheese, tuna, and the like.
"All nouns, as well as the pronoun 'Sie' which means 'You', always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
Without a doubt, it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know if a verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters to particularly watch out for are c and g because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, and carro means cart.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively simple and mostly regular.
This grammar primer will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Of course, if you know any Romance language, you will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know some Spanish may easily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are most often obsolete today and are used as museums or educational sites.
Minor pollution on their best days was not the problem it is today. They are usually found in cities or campuses and are more accessible than those built in modern times.
The most modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China where the favorite flower was the plum blossom.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial palace.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove 'just one' specimen."
"If you visit a formally arranged garden, you will be thrown out without further discussion for collecting 'specimens'."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place and very easy to navigate, and once you arrive, you can buy almost anything.
Situated in the midst of the tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
Several buses head north to Hebron, the cemetery where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Check whether the bus you want to travel on goes all the way to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good topic for a holiday.
For example, a visit to castles in the Loire or Rhine river valleys, a cruise through interesting cities on the Danube, or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also establish routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions characteristic of this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
According to custom, the Easter night is spent awake at some open place to witness the sunrise.
For that tradition, of course, there are Christian theological explanations, but it may be a pre-Christian fertility rite in honor of the arrival of spring.
In more traditional churches, the Easter vigil is often held on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and communities begin the celebration of Christ's resurrection when the clock strikes midnight.
Most of the animals originally came to the islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not reach the island, so the giant tortoise became the primary grazer on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not appear above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to see the polar light because the sky will be more or less constantly dark.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is significantly more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
At the workplace, suits are worn, and colleagues address each other by last names or job positions.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance - the emphasis is on joint effort, not on glorifying individual achievements.
Workers often have to seek approval from their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without any questions.
