This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The findings also provide insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the feathers of the dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but did have other characteristics of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this was the start of a young dinosaur, it showed an example of adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the start of a young dinosaur, the specimen showed adult plumage and not the down of a chick.

She discovered that the sun operated according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system appeared to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation were used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversals.

The accomplished work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written in such a way to simulate observations about the Sagittarius star system.
The effect that the team was investigating would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the stellar system and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational pull on the earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius star system.
The scientists could conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that most dark matter is situated in a kind of halo around a star system and consists of many small pieces.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, she said that the new variant "was very problematic and worrying because of the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients contracted the virus in the hospital and that there were at least two caregivers from the hospital.
In one year's time, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

In France, voting has always been a low-tech experience: voters enter a booth alone, place a pre-printed piece of paper with their chosen candidate marked on it into an envelope.
After the official has established the identity of the voter, the voter lets the envelope fall into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The codification of procedures for the French cheese law is relatively strict.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and returning officers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the election, and that no envelopes are added except those from properly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under sworn supervision, following specific procedures.

In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the sitting category of the competition with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's downhill sitting group could not finish their run, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to secure a place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and a mobile phone back.
Acting Inspector General DK Arya said: "We have arrested five people who breached the Swiss dam and recovered their mobile and laptop."
The suspects are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjer, Ramrpo Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki saw that the suspect entered the courtroom with a covered face.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed there, no one was injured.
Additionally, the driver was seriously injured on his head.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused of the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in jail awaiting the charges and the trial, but earlier witness evidence may be tainted because her picture was featured on a large scale in the newspaper.
In other places in the UK this is common, but Scottish justice works differently and courts consider the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted: “Journalists seem to tread a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc. of suspects.”
The Crown office, which has overall supervision over prosecutions, has let journalists know that no further comment will be given in any case until the charge.
The document will reportedly refer to the border issue, which Palestine bases on the borders before the Middle East War of 1967.
Other topics that are reportedly coming up include, among others, the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years until an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to reduce such a presence to only five years.
The shooters in the ongoing trial with pest control had to be precisely monitored by rangers, because the trial was being followed and its effectiveness was being assessed.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters who were selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the dismissal of the current CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelly's reaction to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The once violent protests were caused by the absence of elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPods have been reported, in total they have caused six fires and left four people with minor burn injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the machine.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had been informed about 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The Ministry reacted by calling Apple's proposal of the bulletin "truly regrettable".
The earthquake was at 07:19 local time (Friday, 09:19 pm GMT) in Mariana.
The crisis managers of Northern Marianas have said that no shame has been given up in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took a couple of tourists from Hong Kong hostage in their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shoots with his M16 at the tourists.
A number of kidnapped tourists have been rescued, and it is said that certainly six people have died.
Six hostages, among them children and adults, were released, just like the Filipino photographer.
The photographers later took the place of an older woman because she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained in a midwifery program and began working in 1959 at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
Meanwhile, while he worked in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate joyful births in his free time.
His research indicated that an injection of a hormone would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
China reported that government investigators found two 'black-box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Colleague sausage sellers also gave money to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night from two to one. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin "Golddust" Runnels noted that "Luna was not as crazy as I was... Maybe even more... will completely miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of 1400 respondents who were surveyed prior to the federal election of 2010, the number of opponents of the Republic of Australia increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim prime minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia had to become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the respondents share this opinion and believe that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent of respondents found that Australia should ideally become a republic, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winners would swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his condition was doubtful.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer sciences at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
At the beginning of February, various people verified the discovery with the help of different hardware and software, and announced it this Tuesday.
Comets could possibly have been a source of delivering water to the earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth was shaped, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, started his governorship earlier this year and signed a law last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political nonsense and idiocy."
It is thought that he will become president in 2016.
NexGen is a system that the FAA claims would enable aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel annually, thus reducing CO2 emissions.
It makes use of satellite-based technology as opposed to the traditional ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots precise information.
No additional transportation is provided and aboveground trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking spaces and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Out of fear of too little transportation, there is the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the supporters of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the discovery of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species developed in just two generations, even though it was assumed that this process would take much longer due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into various shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metal. It can be made so thin that it is often used to preserve hand-painted images in books that are called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The moss juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons with the electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then knead them with clean, moist hands into a ball.
The moisture on your knuckles will react with the outer layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
the cities Harappa and Mohenjodaro had in almost every house a toilet connected to an advanced sewer system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewage systems have been found.
Also in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were toilets. In Roman descriptions, toilets often formed part of the public baths where men and women were mingled in relaxed company.
If someone calls you from thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects this almost immediately back down.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our view.
There is a capable rocket of mine standing 100 feet high ready to place a satellite or telescope into space.
The council has changed the earth in an unbelievable way. The greatest thing the council has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
it has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals, varying from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray house cats) that eat the numerous small outdoor animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has that repeats itself to compete with others.
Lions are very social cats, they live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three related adult males, together with more than thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually related in a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops behave just like meerkats over here, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very social creatures.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, leap over great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger is the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but more like a sentence of sneering, written words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds if they can. Almost all the animals the Ocelot hunts are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think that ocelots follow other animals and find them to eat (pray) by sniffing, tracking where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by stalking in their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from where they originate (for instance, if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they migrate to a new island so that they don't easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
The new environment has various sources and other competitors, so the new population will need other functions or adaptations to be a strong competitor as they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need exactly the same adaptations as before.
After some time, as the new population starts to adapt to their new environment, they gradually begin to resemble the other population more.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out (as they say, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis, they also produce oxygen.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
The Mosasaurus was the most important predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other Mosasauruses.
His long jaws were armed with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set above in his mouth, which meant that there was no escape for anything that came close to his bone-crunching grip.
We are not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even have been a cannibal.
That much also applied to anything that came into the water, even a giant carnivorous dinosaur like the T. rex would not stand a chance against him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and another type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their food while sitting at a bench, the rich people often held banquets where they reclined on their side while they ate.
Ancient Roman meals could not contain any foodstuff that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and not a single old Roman had ever tasted chocolate.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple which was considered as the house of god.
People made offerings to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple court and afterwards an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called Ziggurats, were built to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
The largest part of the life of the Hebrew family played out in the open air.
In the past, people cooked in the main room, shops were open counters that looked out onto the street. Stone was used for the construction of houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland due to murder, and then when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite their discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there.
While every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map written on the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the declaration of independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text was reproduced upside down in the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
It is therefore likely that the notation is simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies entered southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In only two weeks' time, the Americans and the Free French troops liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
A society is a unique culture that is shared by a significant large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civic, and civitas, which means city or state, and that in one way or another also seems to reflect the scope of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A writing culture implies the transmission of knowledge over more generations, a continuous cultural heritage, and an honest distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true descriptions.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with the Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority whatsoever to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive power or judiciary, it relied on the state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its actions.
It also had no authority to impose tax laws and rates between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states trusted the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island on earth.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago."
Already in the 15th century, European sailors who passed by noted the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, which initiated a transformation in the production practices of indigenous grain types and employed Chinese workers to work primarily on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) took control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what it originally looked like there.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this very day.
The most used format for still images in the world is, for example, 35 mm, the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced, but what is more important, the aspect ratio has been taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would therefore be 3:2.
Many popular formats (for example, an APS family of formats) are equal to or approximate this aspect ratio.
The often misused and sometimes ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics and yet maintains a certain degree of order in the image.
There it states that the most effective place for the main subject is located at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was rich and powerful, came under fire.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion held the European states together, despite differences in language and customs.
His all-pervasive power affected everyone, from king to common man.
One of the most important teachings of the church is that a lot of money needs to be used to help those who are suffering and in poverty, and that the church's money should be used for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was already established in Rome for more than a thousand years, and because of that concentration of power and money, many people started to wonder if they truly believed what they had said.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective and cut off vital military and civilian supplies, while this blockade was in conflict with the generally accepted international law that is codified by various international bodies.
Great Britain has dredged international waters to prevent ships from penetrating entire parts of the ocean, causing even neutral ships to be at risk.
Considering there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and realities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way to name different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were intense battles for the throne among many nobles.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died while they fought to sit on the highest throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the revolution, careers were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful men to succeed.
The same thing went for the army, because instead of the army ranking list being based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that went beyond this everyday life. He visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the time, gives a very vivid image of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, which is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
There is nothing else to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. From the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still remains standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures that were built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the largest pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was made to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "upward arc" sign looks like a V, and the downward arc sign is a square missing the bottom side or a staple.
Umhoeg means that you have to start at the point and do the curve, and umlieg means that you have to start at the frog (that is where your hand holds the curve) and pull on the curve.
An upward bow usually generates a softer sound, whereas a downward bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to draw your own markings, but remember that the printed slurs are for a musical line, so they usually have to be respected.
The deathly afraid King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were driven back from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
Once in a carriage, they traveled back to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people who wrote and threatened against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to move the route of their carriage away.
at a given moment, a member of the congregation said with the head of a little rabbit that was killed in Versailles for the frightened queen.
The war expenditure of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds that were traded on behalf of the Philippine government via the banking houses of Wall Street.
Naturally, the super profits that arise from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people form the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The period during which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which according to agreement ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and which manifests in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is beyond the influence of culture on politics, and that technology, in turn, has effects on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
You could say that a car always leads to more stress.
But, building roads through the country is not economically feasible for a few cars, that's why they discovered a new way to make the use of a car cheaper.
Many cars also lead to more accidents on the road, and that results in the development of new techniques in hospitals for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, originating from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, habits and culture emerged that were closely linked to that geography, and these were, in harmony with the place of society, better than any imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of the modern world, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its prominence as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
People looked up to him less in the twelfth century, especially because the crusaders returned with gifts that were valued higher than what they offered in the markets of Byzantium.
In that time, the name of the main city was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached a peak in the period between the 10th - 11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
Due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was the beginning of using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is carried out for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system where stored seeds from the ecoregion are used, involving crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together who often feel neglected by societal criteria and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that can distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw from the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Such children were called somber or wild. Some wild children are locked up by people (often their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the refusal by the parents of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Neglected children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others would be seen as bringing greetings; some would have lived in their own little world.
If the abandoned child has been entirely raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that almost entirely resembles that of the specific caregiver animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make things easier and more interesting, it goes a step further.
Statements are not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Statements can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold but that also applies to the small paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual positions are internalized in the software and are intended to question, stimulate, and explain procedures that might have been too challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children were placed in foster homes for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No single child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to be safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything that is lacking in the home where they come from.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and also communication between people.
The precise characteristics of the Internet provide additional dimensions when it comes to the "uses and gratifications" approach.
They presented "learning" and "socializing" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal camaraderie and "enduring relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivation when they investigated people's reactions to the public of the websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks noted in his paper The President’s Speech how people with brain injuries who are unable to understand language can still accurately gauge sincerity.
He thinks that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals like those that have been domesticated.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two poles of genetic change: conserved and emerged.
Mutations cause new genetic variation and selection removes this from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shift variation back and forth between the two poles with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a gut like that of humans to have enough amino acids with the available plant-based resources.
Besides that, it ultimately leads to the following consequences: major depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The somewhat complex structured plant-based resources are proteins that are available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
There and against is animal food (insects, termites, eggs) not only easily digestible but also provides high-quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not look down on our own ancestors for having solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same manner as chimpanzees do on the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your usual sleep period and falling back to sleep a short while later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you notice that you subconsciously set the clock while half asleep, you can place it on the other side of your room, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, causing someone to be forced to get up and urinate.
The part of inner peace that a person possesses correlates inversely with the level of tension in body and mind.
The lighter the planning, the more positive the presence of life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute freedom and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is supplemented with the Mahayana path of life and with many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channel is purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and culture resulted in the countries drifting apart.
But two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would rage on for the next 40 years and would indeed be fought out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian wall.
These plans, however, were almost outdated from one day to the next when more than 800,000 troops of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and, after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, created chaos.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of navies was traditionally to ensure that your country retained the ability to transport your people and goods, while at the same time hindering your enemy's capacity to move his people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly with U-boats, was busy trying to stop this trade.
If the allies had failed, then Germany would probably also have conquered Britain, just like the other parts of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
As cultures and tribes started to evolve, they began to have for easier access to get milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that grazed over the hills or other areas. They were accompanied by a shepherd, who were often children or young people, as is known of shepherds. This way of shepherding is still used today.
Railways were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Since this road was made only of parallel wooden planks, horses could pull heavier loads more quickly than on the gravel roads of those times.
Dwarf rails were first introduced to keep the track in place. Over time, it became clear that the track would be more efficient if the surface were covered with iron.
This became the municipality, but the iron led to much more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the fully iron wheels were nearly complete.
The first well-known means of transport was walking. People began, with the arrival of Homo Erectus (which literally means "upright man"), two million years ago, to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus might have been able to walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We could be more friendly with the environment. We could join the nature association and we could protest to reduce suffering in the future.
This would in many cases only be symptom treatment. But if we don't want a temporary solution, then we should get to the bottom of the problems and resolve them.
It is clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to technological and scientific advancements of humans. Problems have become larger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of some people.
After it was accepted by the congress on July 4, a handwritten draft by the president of the congress, John Hancock, and secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few streets further to the printing press of John Dunlap.
The whole night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the main room of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6. He presented it to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The original handwritten version did not survive.
Many paleontologists still believe that a large group of dinosaurs are still alive today. We just call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
With many things about birds you are reminded of dinosaurs.
They have feathers with wings and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T. rex.
Practically all computers nowadays are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only two values: 0 or 1, and those numbers are called binary digits or bits in computing jargon.
Poisoning may not always be immediately obvious. Symptoms like nausea are so common that an easy diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of poisoning would be the presence of an open medicine bottle or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
The name beetle is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This name likely comes from the old awareness of bed bugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
Must have a bed because they stay long in their nose, and are adapted to life in the nest or house of their host.
Across the entire United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it the largest neurological disease among young and older adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. It consists of the brain, spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has found that women get MS twice as often as men.
A couple could decide that it is better for them and for the child if they do not raise any children.
These parties could choose to put their child up for adoption.
At adoption, the biological parents give up their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method underlies most scientific research.
But not only that, the implementation of experiments is also used to test hypotheses. Additionally, questions are asked and observations are made to guide the science.
Naturalist and philosopher focuses on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
All the scientific and psychological insights of Aristotle were accepted.
If knowledge of the Greek language were lost, the West would be cut off from its philosophical and scientific origins.
Many observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often dependent on endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Recurring rhythms, which are not just a response to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to run even without external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important to show that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they had labeled the phage's DNA with a radioactive phosphorus or its protein with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many effects depending on how important the piece of DNA is, the type of mutation, and whether the cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germ line can be passed on to the children, while mutations elsewhere can make cells behave differently or lead to cancer.
Nature tourism appeals to people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wild animals.
Examples of local activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching and park visits, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Examples are visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, many people leave the village in cars to go to work, and are passed by others who are on their way to where they have just come from.
Everyone in that dynamic transport system is, in one way or another, connected with, and relies on, private cars.
Science now indicates that this carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses public transport (PT). Almost everyone talks about public transport.
In underdeveloped countries, you hardly ever hear so much fuss about water quality or bridges that collapse.
Why are transport systems so messed up; why do they fail again every day? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is there something fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, traffic behavior of drivers is reasonably predictable; therefore, traffic flow can be fairly consistently represented with mathematical models.
To give traffic flow, relationships between three quantities need to be established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help with the planning, design, and operation of the road network.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. Their ability to fly has helped them to avoid predators and to more easily find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them more hiding opportunities to disappear in small places to avoid predators.
Meanwhile, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago saw a man, Aristarchus, that the planets revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people thought the opposite: that the sun orbited around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems logical, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, or does it sometimes?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth. It flows more than eight times as much water through it as through the largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes as much as 6 km wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Into it flows water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and their technical ingenuity.
Inhabitants of the new kingdom in ancient Egypt admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were already thousands of years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian for its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most employees in the state, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known since ancient times about the existence of simple chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because these can be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, conceived that everything is made from a mixture of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was actually more like the four states of matter (respectively): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Men have also discovered how to change them into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are simply considered an amalgamation of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals like gold and silver.
The ores can also contain deposits that also have small amounts of non-metals like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions could fit at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing have been devised, the pencil has declined to an ever lower status.
People are now typing messages on computer screens, and they never have to come near a typewriter again.
What would happen to the keyboard when something new comes along?
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to create a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Approximately like a heavy load on a mountain slope. The splitting of the core then again provides some of the energy.
Some atoms have no fixed nucleus, which means that they can decay easily without much or any effort.
The surface of the Moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the light side and 100 km thick on the dark side.
It's thinner around the river and thicker towards the highlands.
There might still be a bit more maria on the surface because the crust was thinner. It was easier for the lava to come to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what drives or motivates people.
These theories suggest that some people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they grew up.
These theories examine why certain people want some things and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor theory.
In general, there are two behaviors that can occur when one of the team leads the rest. On one side of the spectrum, it is attempting to stay as one of the group.
These leaders have problems making difficult decisions such as: imposing penalties, evaluating performances, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one changes into an unrecognizable person with the feeling that he or she must change everything the team has done to make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in alienation between leaders and the rest of the team.
Online teams are subject to the same requirements as normal teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Online Team leaders often serve as a contact point for the group that is close to them.
They often have more autonomy than conventional teammates because there are different time zones that are not understood by the local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “Invisible team” is the management to which every member must report. The Invisible team sets the standard for every member.
Why would an organization want to spend so much time on the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One goal of converting learning and organizing concepts into practice is renewal.
If all available resources are used effectively by all departments of the organization, then creativity and resourcefulness can come to the forefront.
Therefore, the collaboration process of the organization, to overcome an obstacle, can lead to new innovation to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of sharing knowledge and organizational development.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method that can be used to improve the performance of organizations.
Neurobiological data has provided much evidence for a new theoretical approach in the research of cognition. As a result, the research field has become much narrower and more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various brain disorders, traumas, lesions, and tumors can influence behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to study the brain structure and processes like never before.
This gives us a lot of information with material to build simulation models that can help us understand processes of the mind.
Although AI evokes a strong sense of science fiction, it is in fact an integral part of computer science. It deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research into AI has to do with the automation of tasks that require knowledge.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to assist customers with questions, and also the recognition of handwriting, voices, and faces.
These days are separate disciplines and focus on finding solutions for problems in real situations.
The AI system is increasingly often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and the military, but is also applied in various home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are organized for each classroom. Quite often, teachers want to take the students to places where no bus goes.
Technology offers a solution with virtual trips. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while they are in class.
The purpose of an online excursion is a good way to reflect on an excursion and share all experiences with future classes.
For example, every student from Bennet School in North Carolina designs a website about their excursion to the state capital. Each year the website is updated, but all versions are kept online as a reference work.
Blogs can also help with improving the writing skills of the students. Although the students often start with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts writing better to avoid criticism.
I also compel blogging to be less naive about the world. The necessity to be interesting to the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a means that leads to collaboration and motivates students to also learn something outside school hours.
Proper use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively participating in online discussions, students can determine their positions in relation to other pieces and also give their own perspectives on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and has many galleries and museums that show the past and the future of Canada.
In the south, we see the Niagara Falls, and in the north is home to the natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario what is seen by foreigners as typically Canadian.
Extensive areas further north are not densely populated, and part of it is almost uninhabited.
A comparison that surprises many people is that there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and almost a continent itself when it comes to its unique nature.
Most of the small islands are independent countries or associated with France. They are known as luxury beach destinations.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and that is still very important in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route around the Cape to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: ‘It is encouraged to say that you are engaged, regardless of whether that is actually the case.
It can also help to wear a ring (but not one that stands out too much).
Women need to realize that there are many cultural differences that can lead to embarrassing experiences, and it is not uncommon to be hugged or followed, etc.
The message must be clear in the behavior of the men, and don’t be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t make it okay!).
The new city Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as an important port called Anfa.
The Portuguese deteriorated it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branco to leave the city again after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish traders gave it the name Casablanca again when they established trading posts there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find stalls selling traditional goods like tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city lies all the way in the east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, an eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed the city of Goma. The lava covered the largest part of the city, especially the city center.
Goma is relatively safe, but as soon as she wants to leave the city, she must check the situation with the unrest in North Kivu.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and a number of the most affordable mountain gorilla safaris in Africa.
To explore Goma, you can use a boda-boda (bicycle taxi). It normally costs (locally) about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for faraway exotic places.
Timbuktu is still a deserted city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, the building was added to the list of endangered world heritage monuments due to desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates’ PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast with the other parts of the country because it has much more Arab flair than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, all optimal for different nature.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African parks (SANParks).
As with all African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which also provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the region of Hong Kong its name and it is the place that many people see as the most important destination.
The parade of buildings against the skyline of Hong Kong resembles a stunning bar chart made evident by the presence of water from Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
Most inhabitants of Hong Kong's urban development are densely packed on reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists had taken for themselves, and if you are looking for the colonial past, then this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest cohesive mangrove in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) out to the coast from the inland areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that lies in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not ordinary mangrove swamps but they contain remnants of the last mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges delta.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which more than one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a safe place for nature. Estimates say that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses go to the inter-district bus station throughout the day (across the river). But mostly, especially for those who go east and to Jakar/Bumthang, between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because the regional buses are usually full, it is a good idea to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts were served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
The sharing of taxis is a fast and comfortable way to travel to places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs post is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region was the home of other tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived from hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, previously called "the large province of India," was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the original groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to hold on to much of its indigenous character and identity.
It is known from Argentina that they have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times during the year.
for information about the tournaments and how to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Argentine Association of Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds were generally accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and American dollars were also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but British and American money can be taken; check in advance with the owner to determine what an acceptable method of payment is.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the islands, so do that before your departure from the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures of +30 are quite normal.
The winter can be dangerously cold: temperatures rarely go below the freezing point, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly “rainy” and “dry” seasons: the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
There have sometimes been many animals in the park to see people, but the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
However docile they may seem, bison, moose, wapiti, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, visitors are surprised because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so stay out of their territory.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears, don’t wear or cook fragrant food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was in 1889 the scene of a notorious maritime standoff as seven ships from Prussia, the US and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and Prussian lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the murder of the paramount chief Tapua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is near two harbors. The most famous ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the area of North Harbour) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch entirely from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all beaches with sand where you can swim safely, and they almost all have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive lie on Waitemata Harbour, in the chic boat districts Mission Bay and St Heliers in the midst of Auckland.
There are sometimes family beaches with many people and a good offering of shops along the water. You could swim there safely.
The most important local beer is 'Number One'. It is not a complex beer, that's enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines available, but the New Zealand and Australian ones might be better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
Australians find the concept of 'flat white' coffee strange. A short black is 'espresso', cappuccino always comes with cream (no milk foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are priced, thus excellent.
Many trips to the reef were made year-round, and injuries here on the reef are therefore rare.
Always follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to all safety warnings.
Great cormorants come close to beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside this period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea; their most important habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Before the break of dawn, the traveler gives the horse so that they can sleep somewhere and until they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is also possible to book other accommodations, such as campsites, through the travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transport to/from the airport, or even flight and hotel combinations.
They can also make the reservation for you in case you need time to think about the offer or need to arrange other documents for the destination (due to visa).
Any changes or requests must first be submitted via the travel agency and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of the music festival visitors decide to camp on the grounds, and most visitors see that as an indispensable part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you will have to be quick to get a camping spot close to the music.
Even though the music on the main stages is done, there can still be places at the festival where music will be played until late in the night.
Some festivals have special campgrounds for families with young children.
If you cross the northern East Sea in the winter, check the location of the hut, because ice can cause terrible noises for those who are hit.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers do not need to have a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos try to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, and clocks are often absent, and exits are difficult to find.
They often have special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and on the premises.
Some establishments offer free drinks. But when you're a little tipsy, you can no longer make good judgments, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone driving at higher altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, it is very slippery, and you cannot drive as on dry roads.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also be very poor due to falling or blowing snow, or due to condensation or ice on the windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and the traffic usually does not suffer throughout the year because of it.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is usually used to refer to foreign trips where the stunning African nature is observed, especially on the savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and standard equipment ensures good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with a binocular.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," or going "footing") consists of a trip of a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city that has organized two Summer Games, because it also hosted them in 1964.
If you had already booked the ticket and accommodation for 2020 for the exhibition, a tricky situation might have arisen.
Cancellation conditions vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
It is expected that tickets for most parts will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average price around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help to make them dry. Many hotels have an iron and board available to borrow even if there isn’t one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or the wearer prefers un-ironed socks, then you could use a hairdryer if they have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it could shrink, or worse, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some are more effective against certain dangers.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others you certainly need a few minutes.
Not all filters are equally effective and if you are also concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reliable company.
Travelers can encounter situations abroad that they can't at home.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or even worse, trigger an allergic reaction, be poisonous, or transmit infections.
Infectious pathogens or large animals that can injure people with physical force are usually not considered pests.
Duty free shop is an opportunity to buy items without taxes and duties in some places.
Travelers on their way to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the toughest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway. It often passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on sand roads, then be careful: you often encounter steep hills, narrow sections, and sharp bends.
Maximum speeds are visibly lower than on every following section - averaging about 35-40 (56-64 km/h) - and good paying attention there is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, the mobile service is often much better than in other parts of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, rich, filling, and varied, comparable to that of their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit dishes are very common, so apples are used all year round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The popular pancake goes well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you like small but fine pastries, then try some Berliner, pancakes, or doughnuts, depending on the region.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term for a gigantic variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
But, without clarification, it usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widespread across the archipelago, has a few simple dishes. The most common flavors from the Javanese include peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a few aromatic spices.
The traces are the straps for the feet of the rider that hang a bit down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can also be dangerous if the rider gets stuck.
If a rider falls from a horse with his foot stuck in the stirrups, he can be dragged along if the horse bolts. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear boots with a heel and a stiff narrow sole.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety bar that ensures the stirrups of the saddle fall away when they are pulled back by a fallen rider.
The Cocamó valley - Chile’s most renowned climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a great variety of granite walls and cliffs.
The top sometimes has a beautiful view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly searching for new paths in the endless possibilities of hiking.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports. You have to slide down the snow-covered terrain with skis or a board on your feet.
Skiing as an activity is a very big travel destination. Usually, the holiday is planned in places where skiing can be done all the time.
The idea of skiing is very old - large paintings already show skiers from 5000 years before Christ.
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was established by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It has to do with, but it's not the same as alpine skiing, or mountain climbing, the latter is done on steep terrain and you need much stiffer skis and boots.
You can view the ski route as a comparable hiking trail.
If you are fit, you can cover long distances faster than on foot - but you will also not achieve the same speed as with cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a small continent with many sovereign countries. Usually, traveling through many countries means that you have to go through many visa applications and passport controls.
But the Schengen zone works somewhat as if it is one country in that respect.
As long as you are in this zone, you can pass through here without passport control.
As well, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa for each individual country in the Schengen zone, which saves time, money, and administration. 
There is no universal definition of what makes games antique. Some appraisal companies define older than 100 years as antique.
The definition has geographical variations, where the minimum age is lower in the US compared to Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antique, although they are younger than mass-produced products.
The keeping of reindeer is an important means of subsistence among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is important for many other people with different occupations.
Traditionally, not all Sami have owned reindeer, so there are also those who lived from fishing and hunting and primarily had reindeer as draft animals.
Meanwhile, many Sami are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the region of the Sami.
The word "Gypsy" is often used, especially among non-Romani, but the word is actually considered offensive because it has a negative connotation with stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani.
If the country we are traveling to receives a negative travel advisory, it could have consequences for her travel insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You can also ask for advice from the governments of other countries, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
An example is that Americans in the Middle East are in a different situation than Europeans and Arabs.
Travel advisories are only a brief description of the political situation in a country.
Opinions are usually superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any type of weather that can potentially be dangerous with the risk of damage, social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on Earth and there are different types of it depending on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and forest fires are forms of severe weather like thunderstorms, hurricanes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal influences can show severe weather phenomena such as snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers were strongly advised to pay attention to the risks of bad weather in the area where they are going.
Anyone planning a visit to a country where there is a risk of war should receive professional training.
Searching online for "hostile environment course" would likely give you the address of a local business.
A course will cover all the subjects he has also encountered before and then in much more detail, and with practical experience.
A course normally lasts about 2-5 days and usually includes a role-play, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about war zones are rarer.
Travelers who want to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad need to have the correct documents with them for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender indicated as (X), or to adjust documents to change the desired name and gender, varies.

Customs checks have become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to be treated with unexamined privacy and dignity by the scanners.
Rip currents are strong currents of waves that break on the beach and often over a reef or something like that.
Due to the underwater topology, the water flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a strong current towards the deep water can form there.
Most accidents happen due to fatigue, caused by the attempt to swim back against the current, which is impossible.
When you are swimming upstream, swimming slowly is not harder than normal.
Try to rely on how you were not caught depending on your strength, or the growth you witnessed, and grow towards salvation.
If she returns, the shock comes faster than when she's gone (because then everything is still exciting). But this shock lasts longer, and can come more intensely.
Travelers who have easily adapted to their new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt back to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and return, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your old habits.
When they went abroad, people probably had understanding and patience at first, because they knew that immigrants had to adapt.
What people may not imagine is that travelers who return home also need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most fabulous things in the area for the children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Mostly you hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and emptiness is just like an audiobook.
The sphinx is used as the background of a long story and is also the narrator.
The scenes were shown on the pyramids and the other pyramids were lowered.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, were claimed by various countries and have the most bases, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include, among others, Livington Island, and Deception where the filled crater lake of the still active volcano forms a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the south of the peninsula bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here into a plateau, and then rise again to form the more than 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, where the Vinson Massif peaks with Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a mobile network, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone, because you have to be outside with a direct line to the satellite in order to make calls.
The drone is often used in shipping, including recreational boating, and also by expeditions that need data remotely and on location.
Your local telephone provider should be able to provide more information about connecting with this service.
A gap year is an increasingly popular option for people who want to travel and learn.
That is especially true for those who have just graduated because they can then be away for a year without it having a great effect on their academic progress.
In many cases, taking a gap year can increase your chances of being accepted at home for your further studies.
Usually one has to pay tuition to be accepted into these study programs.
Finland is a great place to go boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a boat.
Although the archipelagos in the sea and the largest lakes are large enough for all kinds of sailing, small boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Ice fishing is something everyone does in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
Only Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand can do that too, but even there you see that rarely (in Holland, for example, that figure is one in fifty).
Most Baltic cruises have an extended stay in Saint Petersburg in Russia.
That means that you can see a lot of the historic city for a few days while sleeping in the ship at night.
If you only participate in the shipboard excursions, you do not need to have a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin in the brochures. However, Berlin is of course not located by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flights can be very frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
That is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different than personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, it can help to know how airplanes work and what happens during the flight to get over the fear based on the unknown or not being in control.
Courier services are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very crucial for trade documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes, smaller companies were a problem.
If things are sent by freight flights, it can take days before everything is unloaded and through customs.
The only way to get it sent faster is by checking it in as luggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to do so without a person. And that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to put down a hefty pile of money (or better yet, to let your company do it for you).
But there’s a little snag. Normally, you pay up to four times the regular price for business class, and eleven times for first class!
For direct flights, it usually doesn't make sense at all to even look for discounts for seats in first class or business class.
Airlines know that there is a regular group of people who are willing to pay a nice penny to fly quickly and comfortably here and there. And they charge for that too.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian but Russian is also understood.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic and has experienced many ethnic conflicts.

Also to the north, lies the sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, where world-famous Marian apparitions have taken place.
Please remember, you are practically standing on a mass grave. This is a place that has an incredible amount of significance for a great many people all over the world.

Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, and wildcat can be found here, along with many other species.
If you visit women's convents, you must cover your knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries have scarves for women who don't have one with them, but if you bring your own, especially with bright colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Even the man must wear long pants to cover his knees.
This can also be borrowed at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each visitor, so maybe you don't feel comfortable using this option.
The Majorcan cuisine is, just like comparable regions by the Mediterranean Sea, based on bread, vegetables, and meat (mainly pork), and they use olive oil everywhere with it.
Popular simple food, especially in the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and other available ingredients like cheese, tuna, etc.
All proper nouns, including the word You for you, are written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
That is certainly necessary to be able to see the difference between some verbs and the subject.
It also ensures that reading becomes much easier but writing becomes a bit more difficult again because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in the substantive form.
The pronunciation is quite easy in Italian because most words sound exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are the c and g because the pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Also pay attention to the difference in pronunciation between r and rr: caro means dear, and carro means car.

Therefore, reading this grammar introduction could help learn Persian grammar and better understand the sentences.
You don't have to say that if you know Romanian, it is easier to learn Portuguese.
Some people who speak Spanish might conclude that Portuguese is so similar to Spanish that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Observatories are usually not useful for modern research and are often used as museums or educational institutions.
Light pollution was not such a big problem in the past as it is today. They were usually built in villages or on campuses and were easier to reach than modern observatories.
The most modern research telescopes are located in gigantic complexes in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where one had chosen plum blossoms as the flowers to enjoy.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewings were organized by the emperor, exclusively for himself and the other members of the aristocracy of the imperial court.
Plants are at their best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to "just pick one" and take it with you.
Even if you're a subordinate head of visits, you can't go picking plants if you're thrown out mercilessly during the day.
Singapore is generally considered very safe and you can't get lost there. There, you can buy almost everything you need.
But because it's in the tropics, just a few degrees above the equator, you must always take into account that you are dealing with heat and, if it's cloudless (not very often), you have to be careful with the strong sun.
A few buses also go to the north, to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Biblical ancestors Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus indeed goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish city of Kiryat Arba.

Many of the traditions around the holidays are also adopted by people who are not Christian in Christian countries, and in non-Christian countries around the world.
It's a tradition to have an overnight vigil in an open place to be able to see the sunrise.
For this tradition, there are of course Christian theological explanations, but it can also be seen as a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often adhere to the Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, where people start celebrating the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally lived on the island came there by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Because the distance is so great from the continent, mammals were not able to make the journey, which has led to the giant tortoise being the most important grazing animal.
Since people arrived on the island, many animals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the North or South Pole in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun will not rise above the horizon all day.
That is also a good chance to see the northern lights because the sky is almost entirely dark for 24 hours.
The areas are very sparsely populated, and light pollution is usually not a problem so the stars can also be enjoyed.
The Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what many Western people are used to.
