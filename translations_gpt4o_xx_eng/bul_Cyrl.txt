This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely popular, but it also provides details that fossils generally do not offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal on top were chestnut-brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The finding also provides an opportunity to gain insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics - barbs and hooks - researchers conclude that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. According to the researchers, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult specimen, not chick down.
Researchers suggest that while this may be the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathering of an adult, rather than the down of a young individual.

The light and rotation used together determine the star's Rossby number, associated with the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is for magnetic reversal.

The effect sought by the team would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that it affects ordinary matter.
This theory claims that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around it in the form of a halo and consists of numerous small particles.

"They are cooler than the adjacent surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal state is not as stable as that of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glenn Cushing from the astrogeology team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and from Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Traditionally in France, voting is low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a booth, indicate their chosen candidate on a pre-printed sheet of paper, and place it in an envelope.
After the officials confirm the voter's identity, he or she places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
The French electoral law quite strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that at the start of voting there are no envelopes inside and that no other envelopes are being placed except those of duly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Her first was the slalom, in which she ended up with a "did not finish" on her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that run.
In the next competition, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Lösch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four women from the seated skiing group did not complete their rounds, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya stated that they have arrested the five individuals who raped the Swiss woman and have returned her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of the accused.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the chief of police, stated that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver has sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed so that emergency services can extricate the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he is admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From then, Adekoia has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody, awaiting an indictment and trial, but any testimony may be compromised because her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently and courts view the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "it seems journalists are treading a dangerous line if they spread photos, etc., of suspects."
The Royal Prosecution, which is responsible for criminal prosecution, informed journalists that no further comments will be made until charges are pressed.
According to the leaked information, the document will pertain to the dispute regarding the borders that Palestine seeks based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
It is assumed that the other topics reflected are about the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both sides, as well as the question of the Jordan Valley.
After signing the agreement, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agreed to implement such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely supervised by rangers, as the test was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were hired in partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of "Conservation and Heritage" at the National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting have received detailed safety instructions and training.
Martelli was sworn in before the new nine-member provisional electoral council yesterday.
This is the fifth interim electoral council of Martelli in four years.
Last month, a commission to the president recommended the resignation of the previous electoral commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures for the country to move towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime, which began in October, was the commission.
Violent protests were sometimes triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been awaited since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod devices have been reported. Overheating is said to have caused a total of six fires and resulted in minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "a matter of true regret."
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Services in the Northern Mariana Islands reported that there are no damages in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are currently at least six confirmed fatalities.
Six hostages, including children and adults, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a medical career.
She trained as a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in his free time.
His research shows that if a hormone is applied, it will accelerate the fetal development of the baby's lungs.
Government investigators found two flight recording devices "black box" on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Luna was honored by colleagues and fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna left on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. She was a strong woman."
"Luna is strange like me... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... let's hope she is in a better place," commented Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the federal elections in 2010, those who oppose the idea of turning Australia into a republic have increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of those surveyed, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Ultimately, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and participate in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is in doubt.
He couldn't take the medications he needed to manage the pain because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets were formed, especially how Earth was formed, after comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and pinpoint the exact location of aircraft.
No additional transport is provided and the ground trains will not stop at Wembley; there is no parking or drop-off parking available at the site.
The fear of transportation scarcity raised the possibility that the game might have to be held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reports on the emergence of a new species of birds on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species have evolved in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process takes much longer due to the mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis), and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire which can be braided and twisted, after which it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. So thin that it was sometimes used to adorn hand-painted pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts".
This is the pH of a chemical substance. By using red cabbage juice, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is, the cabbage juice changes color.
The amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances and then shape them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, you'll feel it a bit strange, and something like a shell will form.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had toilets with running water in almost every house, connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems were discovered in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women in mixed company gathered together.
You use a satellite when you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest thing we have thanks to the wheel is much easier and faster transportation.
Gave us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And lastly, there are many small cats (including domestic cats at large), feeding on a far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special role that each cat occupies, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three adult males with a blood relationship, along with up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides act very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and just as deadly to their prey.
The tiger, like a well-rounded athlete, can climb (albeit not well), swim, make enormous leaps, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
In the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, the tiger is also included. These four cats are the only ones known for their roar.
The roar of a tiger does not completely resemble the lion's roar, but rather resembles the utterance of growling, screaming words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell, by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
With their night vision, they see very well in the dark and move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and pouncing on their victim.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island, making the return difficult), it often finds itself in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations than before to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they will not be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people emit (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we also make clothes from them. Most edible foods are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set at the top of his mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he might even have been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex could not compare with it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had quite a few strange or unusual delicacies, including boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
The other difference was that while the poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together, reclining on their sides while eating.
It is not possible for ancient Roman dishes to have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, potatoes, tomatoes, cocoa, or any ancient Roman ever tried turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of such significance.
Most of the life of the Jewish family takes place outdoors.
The women cooked outside; the shops were merely shelves facing the street. The houses were built from stone.
In the land of Canaan, there are no extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling west, discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, at that time Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each of the countries was "Scandinavian," there were many differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.
You might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you've watched the movie "National Treasure."
However, this is not true. This is not a treasure map, even though there is something written on the back of the document.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the document upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning, after it was created, the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for preservation.
It is most likely that the notation is added as a label only.
With the landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French from Vichy. These are French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked together with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies entered Southern France on August 15, 1944, and the invasion was codenamed "Operation Dragoon."
Within just two weeks, American and French forces liberate Southern France and head towards Germany.
Civilization represents a culture shared by a significant and large group of people, working and living together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil," related to the Latin "civis" or "citizen" and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," and this somehow defines the scale of society.
City-states were the predecessors of nations. Culture in the context of civilization suggests the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and natural dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving corresponding historical evidence of their existence, and therefore fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national judiciary or executive authority, it relied on the state bodies, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
It also has no authority to reject tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The clauses required unanimous agreement from all states in order to be amended, and the states regarded the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world. They were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
The most popular in the northern regions are winter sports, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan possesses almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, as a geographical concept, it is often referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan traces its origins back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, implementing changes in local grain production customs and hiring Chinese workers to labor on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the loss of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the borders of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they appeared.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
The most common format for still photography in the world, for example, is 35 mm. It was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its image format has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of the sides of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer denominator), therefore, is 3:2.
Many formats that are equal or very close to this ratio are very common (for example, the APS group of formats).
The much-abused and often mocked rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamics while at the same time maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most suitable place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (See the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had already become wealthy and powerful, is subjected to criticism.
The Christian religion has connected European countries for more than a thousand years, despite linguistic differences and various customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone - from the king to the ordinary person.
A fundamental Christian principle is that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the Church has continued in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money makes many wonder whether this principle has been adhered to.
The United Kingdom begins a naval blockade of Germany soon after the outbreak of hostilities.
Although this blockade violated established international law, codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective, disrupting vital military and civilian supplies.
The United Kingdom is mining international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, creating danger even for neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, among most citizens and nations, there prevailed an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
The nations wanted to avoid a military situation again in the future, having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War.
To accept a job at the Edison company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
Arrives in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
In Ancient China, there was a unique way of displaying different periods of time; for each stage of history or for each ruling family, there was a separate dynasty.
Between every two dynasties, there was also an unstable time of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China. Struggling to sit in the highest place in the grand palace of Xi'an, thousands of people perished.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not just to one ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the classes were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of the unit in the army being based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution is also an inspiration for many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. To contemplate, he often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of Nur (light).
the cave itself, which has survived over time, presents a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is entirely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing else can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Erected by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh.
In the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, on the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are in honor of his wives and family members.
The "upward bow" sign looks like a V, and the "downward bow" sign looks like a staple or a square without a bottom.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow), then pull it.
The upward bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward bow is stronger and more confident.
Feel free to place your own bowings, but remember that the printed bowings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, someone from the crowd waved the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves paid the military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The colonial regime of the United States forced them to pay taxes to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
The superprofits obtained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people represent, of course, key acquisitions of American imperialism.
To grasp the meaning of Templarism, the context that led to the creation of the order must be clear.
The period during which the events occurred is usually called the Late Middle Ages - the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 – 1300 AD).
The actual Middle Ages is preceded by the early period and followed by the late period, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice - from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is governed by logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two general ideas are shared among most interpretations of technological determinism: the very development of technology follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, or the technology itself affects inherently, rather than socially conditioned, societies.
For example, one might say that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network would not be economically viable for just a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars has also led to a higher frequency of road accidents, necessitating the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the restoration of damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a large element of cultural determinism, whose beginnings were established by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with this geography arise, and they, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury dates back to around 400 BC and continues until about 1100 BC.
Her status declines in the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders return with gifts such as spices and silk, which were more valued than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes, which was one of the greatest developments of that time.
Agriculture as a means of livelihood is such agriculture that is carried out for the production of enough food solely for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Market farming is a simple, often organic system, frequently utilizing preserved seeds from the same ecological area, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this still holds true for many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards. They allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The signs that define a subculture as independent can be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a given subculture often signal their membership through the characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used means to illustrate the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, mistreatment, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been kept confined by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to the parents' rejection of severe intellectual or physical disabilities of the child.
The wild children, before being abandoned or running away, might have been severely abused or traumatized.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When completely raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical limitations) almost entirely resembling that of the specific caregiving animal, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of instruction but rather assistance that provides support to individuals undergoing new training, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and actual, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffold, as well as the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
The software includes built-in virtual skeletons designed to ask questions, remind, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, nurturing, and educational, but this happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring people to take care, stable education, as well as reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything that was missing from the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The special characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions regarding the use of the satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Imay and McCord (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out how, despite not being able to understand speech due to brain damage, people are able to perceive sincere attitudes.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are 2 groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs through the available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are serious: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins from the leaves and seeds of legumes, but they are difficult for us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all essential amino acids.
Considering all this, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep time and going back to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, thus forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The less tension there is, the more positive the vital force. Every person has the potential to find absolute tranquility and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. Our own tension and negativity are the only things that stand in the way of achieving this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but is continued by many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana path of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy for enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, visualizations, and mantras.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the differences in systems, processes, and cultures led to the conflict between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had already become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years and was considered a real battle through mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize.
These plans, however, became invalid almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after seizing the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to carry a large number of people and cargo across the oceans.
The task of navies, traditionally, is to ensure your country’s ability to move your people and goods while simultaneously interfering with your enemy’s ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval forces are trying to stop this traffic, primarily with the help of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably would have conquered Great Britain, similar to the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to have easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goatherds, who were typically children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These herding methods are still in use.
The railway lines were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rail tracks consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the rougher roads typical of that time.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. Gradually, however, it became clear that the rails would be more effective with an iron strap on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first entirely iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of movement was walking, as people began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (or the upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, generally did not walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in fossils of Australopithecines dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living with more care for the environment, join an environmental movement, and even become activists to somewhat reduce negative impacts in the future.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is evident that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4th and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the handwritten copy was sent to John Dunlap's print shop, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his soldiers on July 9 in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still living today. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people do not think of them as dinosaurs.
But for the birds, which still resemble dinosaurs, there are many things.
They have legs with claws and scales, walk on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and lay eggs.
Almost all computers used today operate based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, with these digits being called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning does not always manifest immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are very common, making it difficult to diagnose immediately.
The presence of an open container with medicine or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific instructions on first aid treatment for this poison.
The term bug is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from the long-standing acquaintance with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both flying bedbugs and common bedbugs are colorless and live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that the likelihood of having MS is twice as high in women as it is in men.
A given couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, after which the other couple can be the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world functions through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
It is not only experimentation, although experiments are used to eliminate some possible hypotheses, asking questions and using guides also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, and particularly with the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to perform the cycle of free-running even in the absence of external cues.
One of the leading hypotheses that DNA is the genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted in which they labeled either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a variety of effects.
Only germline cell mutations can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is appealing to people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plant and animal species.
The activities that can be performed here are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.
Every morning, to get to their workplace, people travel from small provincial towns by car, passing others whose work destination is the place the first ones have just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is to some extent connected to and maintains the transport system through private vehicles.
That this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years, is now being shown by science.
Every person is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely so many complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Since the behavior of drivers unfortunately cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty, studying traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows have some logical continuity and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been determined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections aid in the planning, designing, and eventually the operation of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals that have taken to the air. Their ability to fly has helped them avoid their enemies more easily and to find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects today that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people think he is right, but many hold the opposite opinion - that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable because you can't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at places reaching a width of 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for as much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people. It is the country with the smallest population and the smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of them can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
It was rather like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to shape what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter, and matter itself is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when it appeared, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and usage.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens and do not need to touch pencil sharpeners.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
The nuclear-plutonium bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Then splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which tend to decay with little or no prompting.
The lunar surface consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust there is thinner. It has been easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness focus on discovering what makes people respond or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories examine what makes certain people want the things they do and which aspects of their environment will cause them to either do or not do certain things.
Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory of Motivation" are the two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, once managers start leading their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On one side are those who try to remain "I'm one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of managers encounters difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
A person turns, on the other end of the spectrum, into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Such behavior often leads to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as regular ones, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
"The invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. This team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? In practice, innovation is one of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources in the functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and inventiveness can manifest.
As a result, the organization's process of overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process in service of the client's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organizational learning and shared knowledge.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher results.
Physical evidence for the theoretical approach in the study of cognition is provided by neurobiological data. This narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between pathology and brain behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is of great significance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the training, behavior, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some of the examples that can be listed are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such problems have evolved into separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life issues.
The artificial intelligence system, which is embedded in several home computer and software applications for video games, is already often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs.
Excursions are a big part of school education. Very often, the teacher would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a trip practically is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website for their trip to the state capital, every year this page is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a sketchbook.
Blogs can be helpful for improving students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes that fact.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author, in order to avoid criticism, has started to strive to improve their writing.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to engage the audience's interest inspires students to be interesting and clever (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, "students can be enabled to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials in the context of others' writings, students can determine their positions and also outline their own viewpoints on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming and bilingual capital of Canada, where there are a number of art galleries and museums where you can see Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north lie the untouched natural beauties of Muskoka and the surrounding lands.
All these things reinforce Ontario as a model of what is typically Canadian according to foreigners.
The large areas in the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are nearly uninhabitable deserts.
A comparison of the population that has surprised many: the number of African Americans in the USA is greater than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and is a separate continent in itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations or affiliated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it had a great influence on the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route "Cape of Good Hope," the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the west and south, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for every woman traveling to declare that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can give rise to situations they consider harassment, where they are often followed, grabbed by the hand, and so on.
Be firm when you refuse men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca," but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan restored the city as Dar el-Beida, and it received the name Casablanca from Spanish merchants who established their trading posts there.
Of all Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
It is easy to find places around the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of trinkets, but all this is for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the streets of the city and especially the downtown area.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo Volcano, along with some of the most affordable ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use "boda-boda" (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu," along with its relative inaccessibility, has gained usage as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite being turned into a tourist attraction because of its reputation and having an airport.
It was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS show "The Wonders of the African World".
The city sharply differs from the other cities in the country because it has more of an Arab appearance rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, stretching eastward along the border with Mozambique, Zimbabwe is to the north, and the Crocodile River is its southern boundary.
The park spans 19,500 km², divided into 14 separate ecozones, each with its own distinct wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading one of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
Typically, all South African national parks require daily fees for park entry and conservation.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider worth visiting.
The row of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong is likened to a glamorous bar chart that stands out due to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the developed part of Hong Kong Island is densely situated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers appropriated, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, it's good to start here.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps—they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
Sundarbans occupies an area of 3850 km², with almost one third of this territory covered by water and swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is believed that the area now has 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
The buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (behind the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are convenient and stable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of travel for short distances, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 83 meters, the length is 378 meters, with two sails each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.

The Guarani were the most significant indigenous tribe whose members inhabited present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of native tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who have survived through hunting, fruit gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with local groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its unique character and identity since the founding of Asuncion in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and individual polo players in the world.
The biggest annual tournament is held in December at the polo field in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at another time throughout the year.
Check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo for news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged only at a bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and US dollars are also often accepted within the "Stanley" credit cards.
On the remote islands, they are unlikely to accept credit cards, but British and American currency can be used; speak with the hosts in advance to find out which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combined wind and moisture lead to a feeling of colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: throughout the year the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals still remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they haven't maintained the necessary distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so do not invade their personal space.
Additionally, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia, which has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 18th century, in the 1750s.
In 1889, a scandalous maritime collision took place at the port when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and the UK refused to leave it.
All ships are sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lose their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the "Mau" movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the murder of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland spans two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are patrolled sandy swimming beaches, and most have shade under the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches on Tamaki Drive are by the Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the expensive Mission Bay and St. Heliers areas in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One." It is not a heavy beer but is pleasant and refreshing. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian ones might go down better.
The local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but bottled water is easily available if you're concerned.
The idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. The short black is "espresso," the cappuccino is piled high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian standard. The fruit juices are a bit pricey, but wonderful.
Many of the trips to the reef are year-round, and accidents on the reef, caused by any of these reasons, are rare.
Nevertheless, pay attention to the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. Sometimes they can be encountered outside this period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler that there will be a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although you may also find other accommodation options, like campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be directed to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, a vast majority of the participants decide to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you will need to go earlier to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be festival stages where the music will continue playing late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the hut, as for the most affected, crossing the ice causes quite a dreadful noise.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg also include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to ensure guests spend as much time and money as possible. Generally, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
To keep guests in a good mood and to retain them in the venue, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment deals.
In some places, free alcoholic drinks are offered. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is weak and you cannot drive as you would on clean asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited during snowfall or blizzard, as well as by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snowfall are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is almost continuous throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and are the ultimate destination for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular usage refers to an overland journey to view the amazing African wildlife, specifically in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the cars, and a good view is achieved with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and are better observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "wilderness walk," "tourist safari," or "walking") is a walk lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some of the events will take place at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the season's postponement, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Expectations are that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular ones costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels provide an iron and ironing board upon request, even if they are not available in the room.
If there is no iron or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if there is one.
Do not let the fabric become too hot (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, scorching).
Water can be purified in different ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, bringing water to a boil for a minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are necessary.
The filters have different efficiency, and if you are concerned, you should consider purchasing bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that are unfamiliar to them from their native places.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals themselves, which can harm or kill people with force, are generally not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods without taxes and duties at specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated remote areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns prevail.
The announced speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous or subsequent sections, where they are usually 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h), and strict adherence to them, however, is more important than elsewhere.
The curious thing, however, is that the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other sections of the route, such as the wild areas of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are exceptionally good, and the Bavarian ones are quite lavish and diverse, similar to those made in their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are often encountered, with apples being used in pastries year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair especially well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try these, which, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made of meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
But if used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays widely spread across the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a multitude of simply seasoned dishes, and the predominant flavors that the Javanese prefer are chili peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are foot supports for the rider, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but safety concerns may arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
In case a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, they will be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - the best climbing destination in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with an abundance of large granite walls and cliffs.
The ridges offer breathtaking views from the peaks. Mountaineers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the endless potential of the walls.
Snow descents, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snowy slope with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, more commonly known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave drawings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first sports ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
They are similar, but usually do not include alpine-style ski tours or mountaineering, the latter taking place on steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as similar to a tourist one.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking — but you will very rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on maintained trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean multiple visa applications and passport checks.
However, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
While you are in this area, in general, you can cross the borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen member states, thereby saving time, money, and documentation.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handcrafted items can be accepted as antiques, although they are not as old as the mass-produced ancient goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this livelihood is also important for many others with different occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, with reindeer primarily being draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is a lucrative industry in Sapmi, one of the areas where the Sami live.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romanians, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate portrayals of the Romanian people.
If the country you are going to visit is listed in the travel information bulletin, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may want to consult with other governments as well, but the advice from these governments is intended for their citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may find themselves in different situations from Europeans or Arabs.
Meetings are nothing more than a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the primary term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social issues, or loss of human life.
All around the world, there can be severe weather, and its manifestations are very different and can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and influences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water disasters, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather conditions include blizzards, snow, ice, and sand storms.
Travelers need to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as these may impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be designated as a war zone should receive professional training.
The address of a local company will probably be provided when searching the internet for "hostile environment course."
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, but in much more detail and typically in combination with practice.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid activities, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications that examine military zones.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid return documents.
The willingness of governments to issue passports to individuals with an unspecified gender (X) or to update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The readiness of foreign governments to comply with these documents is also a variable quantity.
Searches at checkpoints have also become much more thorough in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who are about to undergo surgery should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of the waves that crash on the shore, often near a reef or something similar.
The reverse flow, due to the underwater topology, is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current towards the deep water can form there.
Most of the fatalities are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which is likely impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere you won't be caught again or you might want to wait for rescue, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
The shock of returning occurs faster than culture shock (it has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travelers who have found it relatively easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, where you have adapted to the new culture there, you have lost some of your habits from the culture at home.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that newcomers to a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that returning home travelers also require patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
You usually always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of light and sound is like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as both a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are presented on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases, with sixteen of them being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest island.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where there is a spectacular natural harbor due to the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then rise again to form a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut through by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or the Sentinel Range is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson reaching 4,892 m.
In remote locations without mobile phone coverage, your only option may be a satellite phone.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you must be outdoors and in direct line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by the shipping industry, including recreational vessels, as well as by expeditions that require remote data and voice data.
More information about connecting to this service can be provided by your local telephone service provider.
An increasingly popular option for those who plan to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, giving them a year off before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year would improve your chances of enrolling in higher education in your home country.
There is usually a "tuition" fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boating. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands located in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, it is not mandatory to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually big enough for yachts, smaller boats and kayaks offer a different kind of experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The number is the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number ranges from 1 to 40).
Most reputable Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you will be able to visit the historic city for two whole days, returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you disembark using excursions organized by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Berlin, Germany is featured in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all, and the cost of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have experienced a traumatic event or have never flown before.
This is not something we should be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and hatred towards other things that a very large number of people have.
For some people, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies, this has been a problem.
If they have sent things by air transport, on some routes, unloading and customs clearance may take days.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked luggage. The airline rules do not allow sending luggage without a passenger, which is your case.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a hefty wad of cash for this privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: in principle, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Overall, there is no point in even looking for business or first-class discounts for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a significantly higher price for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably, and accordingly, they are charged for it.
Chișinău is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the secession of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, which, despite having its own government and currency, is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
With a population of about 3.7 million people, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Situated around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains, the once ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial hub.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers alternate with traditional red roofs, a 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere in the city is closer to Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers a panorama of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, above some tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking through the exciting village.
A short distance to the north is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after a brilliant account of its splendor recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, also visit the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (altar), a site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting a mass grave site, as well as a place that holds immense significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many surviving men and women who have lived through it here, and many others who had loved ones and relatives killed or who died from working there, both Jews and others.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust and the Nazis.
Do not deface the object by marking or graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because by law it is the first official language.
At the same time, in public transportation and other locations, the Spanish language is widely used.
In the metro, regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but the automated system announces unplanned interruptions in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.

The aloof appearance of Parisians will quickly evaporate if you show a little courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park features dense forests, mainly of beech, spruce, and fir, with a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the variety of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes, there is an extremely large diversity of plant communities.
The area has also been home to an exceptionally large number of different species of animals and birds.
Rare species of fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie, along with many other common species, can be seen there.
During their visit to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts below the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same logic, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
Clothing may be borrowed from what is available at the entrance, but it is not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Like in similar areas in the Mediterranean, Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available products such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" - "You", are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important rule for distinguishing some verbs from objects.
It is assumed to facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to understand whether the verb or the adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are "c" and "g" because their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.

People who know a little Spanish, however, may hastily decide that Portuguese is a close enough language to not need to study it separately.
These observatories, predating today's modern ones, are generally obsolete and are now used as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution, even at its peak, was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, and are more easily accessible than those built nowadays.
Most modern survey telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Observing the cherry blossoms, known as "hanami," has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms are the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor only for him and other members of the aristocracy in the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick even "just one."
During a visit to a well-kept garden, if you pick "samples," you will be thrown out without any conversation.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place. It is very easy to navigate, and you can also buy almost everything after you arrive.
But having ended up in the "deep tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (less frequently, when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are traditionally buried.
Check if the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend the Easter night awake outdoors to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is also possible that it represents a pre-Christian spring fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often organize an Easter vigil on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with the congregation often beginning lively celebrations at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the first herbivorous animal of the Galapagos.
After the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals such as goats, cows, horses, rats, cats, and dogs have been brought there.
If you visit the regions of the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the Sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and, therefore, low pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last names or titles.
Workplace harmony is extremely important, with an emphasis on collective efforts rather than encouraging individual achievements.
