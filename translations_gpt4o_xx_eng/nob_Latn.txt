This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory which is already popular, but shows details that fossils usually cannot show, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called the rachis, but have other functions for feathers—barbs and sheaths—the researchers assumed that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development like the other relevant functions.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not chick down.
The researchers suggested that, although this was a dinosaur's tail, the specimen showed the plumage of an adult and not a chick's down.

The work that was carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was searching for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon affects the gravity on Earth, thereby causing tides, the Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy with its forces.
The researchers reached the conclusion that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in exactly the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory posits that the vast majority of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll came across the tuberculosis (XDR-TB) that was particularly resistant to medication in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some of the patients may have been infected with the bacteria at the hospital and at least two of them were healthcare workers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters enter a booth alone, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their candidate's choice in an envelope.
After officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter roll.
The French electoral law has quite strict codification of legal proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added except for those that are carefully counted and from approved eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all parts of the process. During the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers according to specific procedures and under strict supervision.

Schneider testified from his country through a video link from a USAF base.
Carpanedo competed in 2 individual races in the championship in addition to Wednesday's event.
Her first event was Slalom, but she did not finish the race. There were 36 out of 116 competitors who did not finish the slalom race.
In her second race, she drove to a tenth place finish in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch in first place and 1:09.02 minutes behind Göngyi Dani from Hungary in ninth place.
In the women's sitting group, there were four skiers who did not finish the race, and 45 of the total 117 participants in the giant slalom failed to advance.
The Madhya Pradesh police retrieved the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with covered faces, said Police Chief Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT, while the street where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh court charged with killing her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and a trial, but any potential eyewitnesses may have been influenced since her picture has been widely publicized.
This is common in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish law operates differently, so courts consider the publishing of images as potentially harmful to the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes "journalists seem to be hanging by a thread if they publish images, etc. of suspects."
Journalists have been informed by the Crown Office, which has overarching responsibility for prosecution, that no further comments will be made before the indictment.
According to the leak, the document is expected to refer to the border disputes, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both the nations and the Jordan Valley, was among the topics that were addressed.
Israel continually demands a military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state agrees to let this force remain for only five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control were closely monitored by forest guards, which led to the trial being supervised and its efficiency evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new electoral council (CEP) with 9 members yesterday.
It is actually Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission recommended last month the dismissal of the former CEP (Haiti's electoral commission) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was a response from Martelly to widespread demonstrations against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations arose due to the lack of held elections, some overdue since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and giving four people minor burn injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (METI) said that they had been aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (19:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas' emergency management office said that no damages were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication that a tsunami was coming.
A Filipino man who had previously been a police officer held tourists in Hong Kong as hostages by hijacking their bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Eventually, the photographers took the seat of an old woman when she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 he began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
Liggins began to investigate premature birth in his spare time while he worked at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed up the development of the baby's lung.
Xinhua reported that state investigators retrieved two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was just as weird as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the federal election in 2010, the number who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign at the federal election in 2010 that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent in the poll share this viewpoint, and wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim both the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three stages at the Commonwealth Games, but due to the complaints, there are now doubts about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, who is a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number so far on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the cause of water on Earth, in addition to organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially with regard to Earth.
Cuomo (53) began serving as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and foolishness."
There is speculation about whether he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will make it possible to fly shorter routes and annually save a lot of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based technology, which allows air traffic control to locate planes with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided, above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and short-term facilities are unavailable on the grounds.
The possibility that one would be forced to conduct the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters was raised due to fears of a lack of transport.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species had developed in just two generations, although many had believed that this process would take much longer due to hybridization between the endemic Darwin's finch, the Medium Ground Finch, and the immigrant Cactus Finch, the Large Cactus Finch.
Gold can come in all possible forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can also be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and adhere to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical pH. You can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color entirely depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by how many hydrogen ions (H in pH) are present in the chemical that was tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms are one proton and one electron).
Stir together the two dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this feels strange, creating a sort of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water closets connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient times, there were also toilets in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together.
The times you call someone who is several thousand kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down again, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes some of the light and our vision to be distorted.
A gigantic rocket over 100 British feet is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in great ways. The best thing the wheel has given us is a means of transport that is much easier and faster.
It has given us many means of transport such as the train, the car, and more.
Below them, there are several medium-sized cat species that prey on medium-sized animals like hares, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are several small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat the much more numerous prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind the success is the niche concept. A special job each cat has, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and they live together in larger groups called alliances.
The alliances consist of 1–3 adult males that are related, together with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually closely related to each other, as they make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much in the same way as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals which surprisingly have much in common with the behavior of lions (but not with other big cats). They are also deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, leap over great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones that roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-grown roar of a lion, but more like a sentence with yapping words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find prey animals to eat by smelling, sniffing the ground to determine where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came, for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they relocate to a new island so that they cannot easily move back, they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new population will need different features or adaptations than what they needed before to be a strong competitor, since this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The original population has not changed; they still require the same adaptation as before.
As the new people gradually begin to adapt to their new surroundings, they start to look less and less like the other population.
After a couple of thousand years or after millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We have named this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (so just breathe out well).
The plants make their food from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals would not survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the ultimate predator of its time, which was not afraid of anything, except for other Mosasauruses.
The long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper jaw, no one who crossed its path came away alive.
We do not know for sure, but it might have had a different tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might also have been a cannibal.
In addition, it also attacked anything that came into the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like, for example, a T. rex would be no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent known as dormice.
The fact that poor people and women ate their meals while sitting in chairs, while the rich men enjoyed having banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating their meals, was another difference.
The meals of ancient Rome could not have included foodstuffs that came to Europe from the USA or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn or tomatoes, nor potatoes, or cocoa, and no older Romans have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each god, and these were regarded as the home of God.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary made for the god.
Houses were not so essential in the high-temperature climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family lived mostly outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the yard; shops were only open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the lands around Canaan, which made timber extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and then they found Greenland while traveling west and named it Greenland.
But there were already Eskimo tribes living there at the time, independent of his discovery.
There were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though all the countries were "Scandinavian."
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Despite something being written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So the remark was probably added as a label.
The invasion and the following battles on D-Day liberated Northern France, but Southern France was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French "Vichy" individuals. These were French people who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and actually worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
The invasion on August 15, 1940, when the Allies invaded southern France, was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, linked to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this consequently defines in a way the size of the society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilization's culture presupposes passing on knowledge through multiple generations, a linguistic footprint, and fair communication that endures.
Smaller cultures typically disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not regarded as proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with the Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national leader or judiciary, it depended on state authorities, which were usually unwilling to cooperate to enforce its actions.
Nor did it have any authority to override the tax law and tariffs between the states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian and German national teams are the second best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing are well-liked sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is called Honshu), and this makes Japan the world's 7th largest island!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical context, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 1400s when European sailors passing by gave the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began a transformation of the indigenous people's grain production practices, employing Chinese workers to work on their rice fields and sugar plantations.
Forces from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's coastal areas in the west and north in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the rights to Taiwan to Japan, who continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has 3 important structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was fully restored in 1976, and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, 35 mm is still the most common format for still photography in the world, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but even more importantly, the image sensor formats of digital cameras have inherited the camera's aspect ratio.
It can be a little confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio with this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family formats) are equal or approximately equal to this aspect's ratio.
The rule of thirds is much misused and often ridiculed, but it is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while providing a sense of order in an image.
It asserts that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized during this period in European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had linked European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervasive authority touched everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate pain and poverty, and that is why the church's funds exist.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy demonstrated that the effect of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated widely accepted international law as codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom bombed international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the sea, creating a danger for even neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for an equivalent response to its unrestricted submarine warfare as there was limited reaction to this tactic.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most residents and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing all the fear and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to work for Edison's company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of reference from Charles Batchelor (his former job manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each phase of China or each family that held power was a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best-known in these periods were the Three Kingdoms which took place over 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare among many kings fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China's history, when thousands of people died while striving to take the throne in the great palace at Xiadel.
There are a number of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation is governed by the citizens instead of just one ruler.
Also after the revolution, it was open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same applied to the defense, because instead of military ranks based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired other oppressed working-class people in other nations to also start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that go beyond the mortal life. He often used a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light), where he went to think.
the cave itself, which has been preserved over the years, provides a very vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
On a mountain top north of Mecca, the cave lies completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It is actually not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing else to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The only one of the seven wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, includes many pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upstroke" symbol resembles a V and the "downstroke" symbol resembles a pin or a square without a bottom.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and push the bow.
An upstroke usually brings out a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more determined.
You are welcome to use a pencil and make your own markings, but don't forget that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be taken into consideration.
The terrified royal family, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette together with their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were on October 6, 1789, forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
The king and queen traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats at them.
The people forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows completely open.
At one point, a member of the gang swung the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The Filipino people themselves had to pay for the cost of American imperialism's war, in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs, and the interest on bonds was conducted in the name of the Philippine authorities through the Wall Street banks.
The super profits obtained from the exploitation of the Filipino people were a fundamental gain of the US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the circumstances that led to the establishment of the order.
The age during which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in the period of European history that is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The Mughal Empire did not interfere in societal culture and traditions for most of its existence but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive governing elites, which led to more systematic, centralized, and uniform regulations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general beliefs: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology additionally has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
One can, for example, say that road development is due to the car.
A nationwide road network, on the other hand, is not economically viable if it is used by only a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership creates and more occurrences of accidents on roads, which has led to the invention of new methods in the healthcare sector to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism had a larger element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
What characterized Romanticism was that the landscape shaped individuals and that, over time, geographical habits and cultures emerged, and that when these harmonized with one's position in society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of fashion in our time, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It has been known to be an epicenter of luxury from around 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status was not the same in the 12th century mainly due to the Crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more appreciated than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, attire was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
But due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 - 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style. One of the biggest changes that came at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten garments.
Subsistence farming is agriculture aimed at producing enough food to just meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds native to the area combined with crop rotation or other techniques to maximize yields that are relatively simple.
Historically, most farmers were focused on subsistence agriculture, which is still relevant in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded from social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique due to their members' age, ethnicity, class, area, and/or gender.
The qualities that specify a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate how significant socialization is, is by taking as a starting point the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accidents, or deliberate abuse, were not adequately socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are referred to as "feral children." Some wild children have been kept in captivity by humans (usually their own parents), in some cases due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
It is possible that children who are wild may have undergone serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to escape.
Others are allegedly said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a wild child is completely raised by animals, it develops behavior (within physical limitations) that is almost identical to the nurturing animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that supports individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical. In other words, a teacher can also be a form of scaffolding, but so can the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support functions are integrated into the software and are intended to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for the student to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No children should have to grow up in an atmosphere that is not caring and educational, but it happens.
We perceive that the foster care system is a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities that they did not have in the home they came from.
It is a combination of elements with both mass and interpersonal communication on the internet.
The special characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in relation to the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivational factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified "personal engagement" and "sustained relationships" as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience reactions to websites (1998).
Through the use of video recordings, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It has been particularly claimed that one can find out if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks suggests in his newspaper, The President's Tale, how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity correctly.
He also claims that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals, such as pet dogs.
According to modern research, there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new gene variation and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination switch back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to obtain sufficient amino acids from the available plant resources out on the savanna.
Moreover, not doing so has major consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would have been the most accessible plant resources, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them first.
In contrast, animal food products (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide proteins in high quantities that contain all the essential amino acids.
We should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in quite the same way that the chimpanzees on the savannah use today.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during the normal sleep period while falling asleep again a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a rather quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythm involve having drunk a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which leads to the necessity of getting up to urinate.
How much inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. All human beings have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only thing preventing such insight is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but was expanded to include the Mahayana path of love and several methods from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and complete love.
Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) can be awakened with kundalini yoga through yoga positions, breath training, mantra, and visualization.
Tibetan meditation is about deity yoga. The energy channels are cleansed by visualizing different deities. In this way, the chakras will be activated and consciousness will be enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which caused cooperation between the USSR and the USA. The clashes between systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries falling out towards the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last the next 40 years and was truly to be fought, by proxy armies on battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places from Africa to Asia.
By 09/17/1939, the Polish defense had already been broken down, and the last option was to retreat and reorganize along Romania.
These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish peace treaty, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across seas.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The campaign in the North Atlantic during the Second World War is one of the most important recent examples of this. The Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic to provide aid to Britain.
The German navy simultaneously tried to stop this traffic, mostly by using submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have managed to conquer Great Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
It began with ancient cultures and tribes keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that strolled along hills or other places for grazing, usually looked after by goat herders who were often children or youths, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways in England were made as early as the 1500s.
Although the wagons' paths consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull in order to achieve greater speeds and carry more load than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
To keep the tracks in place, the cross rail was introduced quite early. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks were more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, the tricycles were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transportation. Humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, and bidirectional specialization has been discovered in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2–3.9 million years ago.
We can start by adopting a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to some extent to diminish the pain that is to come.
This is often exactly like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and remove them.
The world has changed significantly due to humans' scientific and technological advancements, and challenges have become more complicated due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
A handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and then sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap after its adoption by Congress on July 4th.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and these are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One arrived at George Washington on July 6, which he had read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives on today—they are called birds.
Some people do not consider them real dinosaurs because they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind one of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually almost all PCs used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning might be finding opened medicine containers or toxic household items at the scene.
For first aid guidance specific to the poison in question, see the label.
Entomologists use the word insect in a formal sense for this income group.
This term originates from an old association with mites, insects that are highly adapted to attack humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or home of their host.
According to what we know, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the entire United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may come to the conclusion that it is not the best for them, or the child, for them to raise a child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. Most scientific research is actually guided by this method.
However, experimentation is not alone there, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses by asking questions. Observations also help to guide scientific research in the right direction.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on everything related to science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek deteriorated, the West became further removed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are usually entirely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been detected in almost all living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and not just as reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of independent cycles without external influence.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the foremost proposals that claimed DNA could be genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or in other words viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted 2 attempts to label either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are bacterial cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of location activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, going to parks, and examining details about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive cars to get to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplaces are in the village that others are driving out of.
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone is in some way connected to, and supporters of, a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Science shows that the big carbon economy has loosened the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Most are dissatisfied with the transport systems.
In developed countries, one can rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or about bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems create such dissatisfaction, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is complicated to study traffic flow, since it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with a certain level of consistency, allowing traffic flow to remain fairly consistent and capable of being calculated mathematically with a reasonable degree of certainty.
To better demonstrate the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three important characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist with the planning, design, and operation of driving facilities.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. Their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape enemies, find food, and mates.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings backward along their bodies.
Because of this, they have several small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus believed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This seems sensible, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the Earth's largest and second longest river. Here flows more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, it is ten kilometers wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers on Earth and into the sea comes from the Amazon.
The main river, Amazon River, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although pyramids continued to be built in stone until the end of the ancient Egyptian empire, they never surpassed the size and technical execution of the pyramids in Giza.
Egyptians from the New Kingdom in ancient times marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by Vatican City in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language used daily by the government employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every citizen of the Vatican is Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these are found in their natural form in nature and because they are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had theories that everything involves a mix of one or more of the earth's four elements. The four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also believed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mix of 2 or more metals. Remember that there is a variety of elements on the periodic table.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that some trillions of them fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good helper for many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, now that newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been regarded with lower status and use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, and must never get close to a sniper.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that in order to assemble a nucleus with more protons and neutrons, energy is required.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the core anew and releasing some of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to fall apart more or less unprovoked.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the long side.
Thinner under Maria, and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there is more magma on the side facing us because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they mature and approach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
As a rule, two behavior patterns emerge when leaders start leading their former colleagues. One part of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the gang".
For this type of leaders, it can be difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable person who feels he or she has to change absolutely everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for whether the team wins or loses.
This behavior often ends in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact for their immediate physical group.
They generally have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to many different time zones, which the local management may not always understand.
An "invisible team" that is present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element in a virtual team.
The "invisible group" is the management group that each of the members reports to. The invisible group sets the standard for each individual member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively by all functional departments in an organization, creativity and innovation can arise.
The process where an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can thus lead to a new innovative process that can help meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, the management must create an innovation culture as well as share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a way to provide assistance to organizations to improve performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical documentation for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. It narrows the field of research and makes it more precise.
The interaction between brain pathology and behavior is a confirmation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Brain structures and processes we have never seen before can now be examined thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes taking place in our brain.
Although artificial intelligence AI gives a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring and planning the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting analysis, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, built into several home PCs and video game software.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom. Teachers generally love to take students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the possibility for a solution with virtual excursions. Students can observe museum items, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
A great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes can also be to share the excursion virtually.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital. The website is restructured every year, but old versions are kept online to be used as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
The blog author began to improve their writing to avoid criticism, as students are often the most critical audience.
"Blogging also 'forces students to become more informed about the world around them.' The need to provide what is desired to the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that motivates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning abilities beyond the typical school day they are accustomed to.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students to think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in relation to others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada with several art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's history and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and to the north, in Muskoka and beyond, one can find untouched nature in all its beauty.
All this and more shows Ontario as what outsiders consider to be genuinely Canadian.
Large areas to the north are very sparsely populated and in some places are almost just uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of the population that surprises many: There are more African Americans residing in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and known as luxury holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the northern region, it is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is recommended that traveling ladies say they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences may lead to what they would consider harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be determined to say no to men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still does not make it acceptable!).
The city we know as Casablanca today was founded in the tenth century BCE and was used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by Berber fishermen, Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese tore it down and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan developed the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was called Casablanca due to Spanish merchants who had established their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in all of Morocco.
Places where one can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hoodies, and a whole spectrum of djellabas, are easy to find around the old medina, but they are mainly sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, the eruption caused most of the city's streets, especially the city center, to be buried.
Although Goma is quite safe, all visits outside of Goma should be read about in advance to understand the ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing up the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the most affordable mountain tours to see gorillas in Africa.
To get around in Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands, combined with relative inaccessibility.
Even though Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made the city a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Due to the threat from desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1990.
It was one of the major stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, because it has a more Arabian than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is the southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km² and can be divided into 14 different ecozones, which support diverse wildlife.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa, and it is considered the finest national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card (a ticket), which provides access to either a selection of parks or all the national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and it is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a sparkling bar chart clearly visible thanks to the waters that make up Victoria Harbor.
If you want the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront which is located opposite.
The majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and this is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The largest coastal zone on the planet is Sundarbans, which extends 80 kilometers (50 mi) inland into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps – here are some of the last remaining areas of jungle, which once covered the gigantic plains.
The Sundarbans consist of an area of 3,850 km² with about one-third of the area covered by water and marsh.
The Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses run from the bus terminal (over the river) throughout the day, despite most, especially the buses heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Since the district buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese coastal buses that are both comfortable and sturdy serve most districts.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River and connects Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers soar 83 meters, it is 378 meters high, and it has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational from September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guaraní group; they were semi-nomadic hunters, but agriculture was also their livelihood.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 1500s, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," became a country as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous people.
The colonization period, which lasted for 3 centuries, was started by the Spaniards.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
This year's biggest tournament is held in December, at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here.
Visit the Argentine Polo Association to find news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The Falkland Islands pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falklands, with its value set equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located in Stanley above the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley—credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what is an approved payment method.
It is difficult to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make sure to exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern part of the planet, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
The cold can be deceptive in the winter since the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but a combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.

Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but nevertheless, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
Bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack no matter how peaceful they may appear.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they have not kept a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant meals and keep a clean camp.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, the USA, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor in 1889, it became the notorious site of the sea protest.
Except for one British cruiser, all the ships were sunk and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful city gathering led to the killing of the leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's two harbors, there are several beaches. The most popular ones are in three locations.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbor district are located in the Pacific Ocean. The beaches there stretch all the way from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Nearly all the beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes you find crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The most important local beer is "Number One," which is not complex but a pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that should be tested, but wine from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
For people from Australia, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso," cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cocoa lives up to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive, but fantastic.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef, and damages due to any of these things are rare.
Nevertheless, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and close to rivers from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be observed outside this period.
There are sharks, but it is unusual for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the sea. Their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind since they now have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although there may be opportunities to book accommodation in other areas, such as at a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies most often sell package deals including breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even package combinations with flights and hotels.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to think about an offer or get other documents for your agreement (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of the festival guards decide to camp on site, and most of the guards consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near where it's happening, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night even though the music on the main stage is finished.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going over the Northern Baltic Sea in wintertime, you should check the cabin's location, as driving through ice produces an extreme amount of noise for those who are most affected.
Cruise to St. Petersburg includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos tend to make many attempts to maximize how much time and money are spent by the guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers for the guests, so that they are in a good mood and want to stay at the place.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. But being under the influence of alcohol impairs judgment; all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at higher elevations or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or cold.
The friction is low, on ice- and snow-covered roads you therefore cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall for you to slip in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the largest form of tourism that attracts tourists to Africa and is the main focus for many visitors.
The term safari in popular parlance refers to journeys to countries to see the magnificent African wildlife, specifically on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach cars and standard equipment, which will allow for good viewpoints.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be quite shy, and you see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk" or "balance walk") involves going on a hike, either for a few hours or over several days.
The Paralympics will be from 08/24/2021 to 09/05/2021. Some events will be held in other places around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice. The city held the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might struggle.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, the cancellation policies will not be extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most activity tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets priced around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is unavailable or you want to avoid wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer instead, if it is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinking, or in extreme cases, scorch marks).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ in terms of effectiveness, and if you have any doubts, you can always buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter infectious animal diseases that they are not familiar with from their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or in the worst case lead to allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that are capable of harming or killing humans with their power, are generally not qualified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and can only be bought in specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging conditions for driving on the Buffalo–Pittsburgh highway are the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often goes through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your head cool: there are many steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp curves.
Speed limits posted are noticeably lower than in preceding and following sections – usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) – and it's even more important to adhere to them than otherwise.
Strangely enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than along many other places along the route, e.g., Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty. In Bavaria, they are rich and varied, and can be compared to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with baked-in apples year-round, and cherries and plums make their entrance in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Many of the popular cakes taste especially good with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry dish is based on herbs and spices, mixed with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid you have in, a curry dish can either be dry or moist.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is regularly used in curry dishes, while it is common to use coconut milk in Southern India and some other coastal regions on the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian dishes are an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines across the entire nation.
If used without further context, however, the term usually refers to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, much is available throughout the entire archipelago. The Javanese cuisine is characterized by lightly spiced dishes, with a dominant taste of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hang down on each side of the saddle and are supports for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can be less safe due to the possibility of a rider getting stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with one foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged after the horse if it runs away. To mitigate this danger, many precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders use riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that make the stirrup leather fall off the saddle if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, Cochamó Valley, is known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and granite cliffs.
The top climbing offers stunning views from the mountain peaks. Climbers from all over the world continuously create new routes in the endless seas of mountain walls.
The snow sports of downhill skiing, which include both skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered areas with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Ski vacations are a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depict skiers dating back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century. In 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity also has other names like backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not include alpine style skiing, or alpine climbing; the latter is done in steep terrains and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than if you walk – but it is very rare that you will achieve high speeds without a heavy backpack in track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a journey through several nations would mean multiple visa applications and passport controls.
However, the Schengen Area functions almost like one country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport checkpoints again.
At the same time, you do not need to apply for a visa to each individual Schengen member country if you have a Schengen visa, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal explanation for what types of manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies regard items that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, including that the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Crafts can be defined as antiques even though they are newer than comparable mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi and also important for the trading culture for many with other occupations.
Although traditionally not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, while reindeer were mostly used as draft animals.
In our time, many of the Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romanians, it is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate impressions of the Romanian people.
If travel advisories are issued for the country you plan to travel to, it may impact your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may also wish to consult authorities other than your own, but their advice is intended for their residents.
An example might be that American citizens in the Middle East encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The guides are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The exhibits presented are often superficial, general, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all very severe weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social consequences, or loss of human life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world; there are different types. Weather types can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena consist of snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Those who plan to visit countries considered to be war zones should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment training" will likely yield the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last two to five days and involve role-playing, some first aid, and occasionally weapon training.
It is common to find books and magazines about wilderness survival, but there are few publications that focus on war zones.
Travelers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
Foreign governments' willingness to honor these documents is just as variable.
In the time since September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect that they can get through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break on the beach, a reef, or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, creating a rapid current so that deep water can form there.
Most of the deaths occur due to exhaustion while attempting to swim back against the current, which can be very problematic.
As soon as you get out of the current itself, it is no more problematic than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be dragged along again or, depending on your skill and whether you have been noticed, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
A reverse culture shock occurs earlier than a culture shock (the tension phase is not there in the same way as when moving out), it lasts longer, and can become more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the old habits from your home culture.
The first time you traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, since they know that the traveler has to adapt to an entirely new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most exciting attractions in the area for children is the pyramid's sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night, and you have the opportunity to see them in peace and quiet before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the sound of tourists and vendors here. The account of the sound and the light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set both as a background and as a narrator of a long history.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a volcano that is still active provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then they reappear and form the 360 km long mountain range which is the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Mount Vinson's summit has an elevation of 4,892 meters and is located on Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, in the northern part of the Sentinel Range.
In remote areas with a lack of mobile coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to be able to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, recreational boats, and additionally on expeditions that have remote data and contact needs.
You can get more information about connecting to this service from your local telephone service provider.
Receiving education while traveling is an increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, so they can take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education when you are back in your home country.
Usually, there will be a school fee to register in this type of educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat enthusiasts. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
It is not necessary to have a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak, provide a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland with one boat per 7th or 8th person.
Although this is similar for both Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (as in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most of the distinct Baltic cruises had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend a couple of whole days in the historic city and return to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore using ship excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and therefore the trip there is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of, it is no different than other things that many people fear or dislike.
Gaining an understanding of how the plane works and what occurs during flight can help some people overcome a fear based on the unknown or on not having control.
Shipping companies earn a lot of money to deliver items quickly. Often, time is very significant when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On certain routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but for smaller companies, it was problematic.
If they sent things by air freight, it could have taken days on some routes to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come into the picture.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to fork out a thick stack of money for the privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
This, however, will not be cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can prepare to pay up to four times more than the regular economy price for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of flyers who are willing to pay well to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and are charged accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. Romanian is the local language, but Russian is also widely used.
The multiethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova; it has its own government and currency, but it has not been recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the 3rd largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. Izmir is the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transportation hub.
Smyrna used to be just an old city, but it is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The broad avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are drawn with traditional red gabled roofs, the square from the 18th century along with old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more similar to the European Mediterranean area than traditional Turkey.
One can see the island of Eysturoy from the village of Haldarsvík, which also has an unusual octagonal church.
There are fabulous marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the cemetery.
It is worth spending half an hour strolling in the exciting village.
To the north and not too far away lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra. It became known among foreigners after Lord Byron gave it a glowing review.
Scotturb bus no. 403 travels regularly to Sintra and has a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you must also visit the vast crypt of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place with Marian art that is popular all over the world.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, in addition to a place that holds an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time there, and many more who loved those who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat the place with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Please do not damage the area by marking or scratching graffiti into structures.
Barcelona's official languages are both Catalan and Spanish. Around half prefer Catalan, and most have an understanding of that language, but practically everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only in Catalan because it is legally designated as the first official language.
Spanish is also used in public transport and other facilities nevertheless.
Regular announcements at the Metro station are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The reputation of Parisians is that they are egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave as best as possible, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make it considerably easier to get around.
The Parisians' fast facade quickly disappears if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by a lot of forest, mainly of beech, spruce forest, and spruce trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an especially large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying levels of elevation.
The area also houses a great many animal and bird species.
There one rarely finds fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owls, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with several common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shawls to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it has bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men are required to wear pants that go over the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the storage at the entrance, but the clothes might not be washed after each user, so it may be less comfortable to wear these skirts. One size fits all!
Dishes in Mallorca, as in similar areas in the Mediterranean, are based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and use olive oil for everything.
An easy and well-liked meal, at least in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Slice with olive oil, tomato, and optional toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns that accompany the word Sie for you always start with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
This is a significant method for being able to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
That also undoubtedly makes reading easier, even though writing is a bit difficult, since one then has to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be aware of are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
In addition, you should be careful since the pronunciation of r and rr is different: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and quite straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand the sentences better.
If you already know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish quickly find out that Portuguese is similar enough that one does not need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually somewhat outdated in our time and are often used as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not the type of problem during their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or at study sites that are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossoms that appear have been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.
The concept came from China where blooming plum blossoms were the most popular flower.
The first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor in Japan solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
The plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally designed garden and pick some "samples," you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally a place with high safety; it is a very easy place to navigate, and you can get most things there once you arrive.
But if you are placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to consider both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which does not occur as often).
There are also a couple of buses heading north to the city of Hebron, to the traditional burial site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba, which is nearby.
The waterways in the inland can be a nice theme to base a trip on.
Visit for example the castles in the Loire Valley, Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions we have during the holiday season have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to stay awake through the Easter night at an exposed point to watch the sunrise.
It may well have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but of course there are also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Several traditional churches often hold the Easter service on a Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the congregations often beginning the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The mammals could not make the journey due to the long distance over to the continent, and thus the large land tortoise became the first grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Many mammals have been introduced after humans came to the Galapagos, such as goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, during this time the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to discover the Aurora Borealis, as the sky remains dark more or less around the clock.
As the places are sparsely populated and light pollution rarely is a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than Western people are accustomed to.
Suits are the standard work attire, and employees address each other by last name or job titles.
Cooperation is important in a workplace, with an emphasis on group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees often must obtain their superiors' approval for any decisions they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
