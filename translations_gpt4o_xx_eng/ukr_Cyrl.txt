This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils could not offer — such as color and a three-dimensional image.
Scientists claim that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, known as a rachis, but do have other features of feathers—barbs and barbules—researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved much later than these other features.
From the structure of the feathers, it can be concluded that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for display. Researchers suggest that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult plumage, not chick down.
Researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than the down of a chick.
Yesterday morning, near a police station in the city of Gaziantep, Turkey, a car bomb detonated, resulting in the death of two police officers and injuries to over twenty others.

They concluded that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: as it turned out, the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to changes in the magnetic field.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but a program was created to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for will be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way affect the galaxy in Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of numerous small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new strain is "extremely alarming and concerning due to the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were medical workers.
During one year, an infected person can infect between 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of MDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still remains low; 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 get infected every minute in South Africa.

During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night, they are warmer.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain an almost constant temperature, but it indicates that these must be deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Division of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting traditionally does not involve the use of high technology: voters enter the booth one by one and place a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of their candidate into an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The electoral legislation of France encodes proceedings quite rigorously.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the start of voting, and no envelopes are added except those properly cast by counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision and in compliance with certain procedures.

In the second run of the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position in the women's sitting category with a total time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austria's Claudia Lösch, who finished in first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four female skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their runs, and 45 out of all 117 skiers did not place in the super-G slalom races.
Police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.C. Arya stated: "We have arrested five individuals who assaulted the Swiss woman and returned her stolen mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with a covered face.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency responders were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he was taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekeye appeared in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody and awaiting charges and trial, but the testimony of any witness can be disputed because her photo has often been published.
In other provinces of the United Kingdom, this is a common practice, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are clearly heading down a dangerous path by disseminating photos and other data of suspects."
The prosecutor's office, generally responsible for prosecution, told journalists that it would not provide any additional comments, at least until the indictment is issued.
According to the information leak, this document will refer to the conflict surrounding the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on the borders that existed before the Middle East war of 1967.
Other topics likely to be covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands to maintain a military presence in the valley for ten years after signing the agreement, while the PA agrees to leave such presence for only five years.
Hunters in the auxiliary fight against pests had to be carefully monitored by rangers, as hunting was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the UNPZ and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (ASSA), qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Director of Parks & Wildlife Conservation of the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first culling operation have been properly instructed on safety and trained.
Yesterday, Martelli took the oath in the new Interim Electoral Council (IEC), which consists of nine members.
This is the fifth Interim Election Council of Martelli in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous Central Election Commission as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the large-scale protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were provoked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been delayed since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating defective iPods were reported, which caused a total of six fires and resulted in minor burns in four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that they are aware of 27 emergencies related to these devices.
Last week, METP announced that Apple informed it about 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay with the report a "major annoyance."
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. Greenwich time on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management informed that no damages were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were successfully rescued. Currently, it is reported that at least six hostages have been killed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of the elderly lady because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He received his education as an obstetrician-gynecologist and got a job at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During his time working in the hospital, Liggins began studying premature births in his free time.
His research showed that the administration of the hormone accelerates the embryonic development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, state investigators retrieved two flight recorders (black boxes).
Fellow soldiers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite unique, just like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1400 people surveyed, by the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Temporary Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic after the reign of Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of respondents believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Considering the categorical answers to the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and participate in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but concerns about his physical condition arose due to his complaints.
He could not take painkillers because they are prohibited during participation in the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematics specialist and professor of computer science from the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest currently known prime number.
Some people confirmed the discovery using various gadgets and software before the beginning of February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets might have been a source of water supply to Earth, as well as organic substances capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
They say he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will enable aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite technology, as opposed to the more outdated ground radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with maximum accuracy and provide pilots with detailed information.
No additional transportation is being launched, and the above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the surface.
Concerns over the lack of transportation have led to considerations of holding the game behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
In a study published on Thursday in the journal Science, the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands was reported.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch immigrant, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into a variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stuck onto another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. An indicator can be created using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The acidity level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders by rotating them in a container, and then knead them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, providing unusual sensations and forming something like a shell.
The toilet, connected to a complex sewer network, was in almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
Remains of sewage systems were found in houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also present in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a signal and then almost immediately reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts the light and what we see.
A giant rocket at least 100 feet tall is needed to deliver a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has incredibly changed the world. The most significant thing the wheel has done for us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
It gifted us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Below stands a larger number of medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that hunt more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche – a special position each cat occupies, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
A pride includes one to three adult male relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely connected to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides largely behave like packs of wolves or dogs — animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in behavior (but not to other big cats) and just as dangerous to their prey.
The tiger, like an all-rounded athlete, can climb upwards (though not very skillfully), swim, jump long distances, and also strike five times stronger than a strong person.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like confused exclamations.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and stalk the animals they hunt by scent, searching for their smell on the ground.
Thanks to their night vision, they see very well in the dark and move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in their surroundings and then suddenly pouncing on their target.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to another island and therefore cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new species will need to develop new traits or become a stronger competitor than it was before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all – they still require the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an extremely important component of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans expel from the body (i.e., exhale).
Plants prepare food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we consume is plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth along with an additional set on the palate, meaning that no one who crossed its path would be able to escape.
We do not know for sure, but perhaps he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly he was even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that ended up in the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not be able to compare to him.
Predominantly, the Romans ate foods familiar to us, but they also had their own strange and unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to hold communal banquets where during meals they would relax by reclining on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not have included products that were brought to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For instance, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of that god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
In each temple, there was an open temple courtyard, and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids were built, which were parts of temples and were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not all that important.
Most of this Jewish family's life was spent under the open sky.
The women were preparing food in the courtyard; the shops were ordinary open counters that faced the street. The houses were built from stone.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The ancient Scandinavian sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Despite the fact that there is indeed something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document and is upside down.
There is no information about its author, but it is known that at the beginning of its existence, the document (which measures 29¾ by 24½ inches) was kept in a rolled-up state.
Thus, it is quite likely that the entry was added merely as a label.
As a result of the D-Day landings and the subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French Vichy. These were the French who signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, and this landing was named "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the "Fighting France" movement forces liberated the south of France and moved towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture of a large group of people who live and work together, that is, a society.
The word "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means "civil", referring to the Latin word "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", and this also, in some way, defines the size of a society.
City-states can be considered precursors to nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and even distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, and thus they are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — Congress was its only component — according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the authority to impose taxes, and in the absence of national executive or judicial power, it relied on state bodies that often did not cooperate in implementing all its acts.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before being amended, and the states took central authority so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Such types of sports competitions as football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing are widely known.
Winter sports are the most popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" due to the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European navigators, sailing by, recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a branch in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating the transformation of the indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed photographic image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main format at the end of the analog film era.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, being 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this proportion.
The often-used and mocked rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
According to it, the most effective place to position the main object is at the intersection of the lines that divide the grid into three thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held European states together despite differences in languages and customs.
His ubiquitous power had an impact on everyone: from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should combat suffering and poverty, and the church's funds are intended precisely for this purpose.
The central body of the church had been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money led many to question whether the church truly adhered to this postulate.
Soon after the sudden onset of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective. Although the blockade violated generally accepted international legal norms codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries, it cut off vital military and civilian supply routes.
Britain extracted minerals in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, creating a danger even for neutral vessels.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany was expecting a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant sentiments among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Realizing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations sought to prevent such events in the future.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States of America to apply for a position at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In Ancient China, different time periods were represented in a unique way; each stage of the country's development was marked by each ruling family that rose to prominence as a distinguished dynasty.
Moreover, between each dynasty, there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Jin and Han dynasties.
In these times, fierce wars took place among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in the history of Ancient China — thousands of people died in battles for the throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, for example, the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, as well as the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single autocratic ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all willing men, giving the most ambitious and talented the opportunity to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of army ranks based on class, they were now based on qualities.
The French Revolution also inspired many members of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira," on the mountain "Nur" (light) for reflection.
The cave itself, which has been preserved to this day, provides a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if its existence is known. Once inside the cave, you will find yourself in complete isolation.
Nothing is visible except for the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains around. Only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that exists to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many great pyramids constructed in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Khufu), small tombs, temples, and also the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was erected in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like the letter "V", while the "down bow" mark resembles a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
Up means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow movement is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own pencil markings, but keep in mind that printed markings for string instruments carry specific meanings, so they usually need to be taken into consideration.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market drove the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, from Versailles and forced them to return to Paris.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a gang member waved the severed head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA to cover a significant portion of the costs and interest on loans taken out in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The windfall profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos, of course, would become the main achievement of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that served as the impetus for the creation of the order.
The era during which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Classical Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that essentially encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or the technological imperative to the idea that human destiny is strictly dictated by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology as such follows a path that is largely beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on societies that is more inevitable than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might argue that the car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is economically unfeasible for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road traffic accidents, which results in the invention of new methods in the healthcare sector for treating bodily injuries.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged associated with this geography, which, being in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being the epicenter of luxury, dating back to approximately 400 AD, and which lasted roughly until 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its position worsened mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than in the markets of Byzantium.
It was at that time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the attire of the inhabitants of the East was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may lag by 25-30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons for fastening clothing.
Non-commercial farming is agriculture whose goal is to grow enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses harvested seeds of local plants from a given ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still prevalent in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to gain a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be defined by the age, ethnicity, social class, residence, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of the subculture often express their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion items, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take several stories of unfortunate children who grew up in neglect, misery, or deliberate cruelty, and were not socialized by adults.
Such children are called "jungle children" or wild. They are often kept in captivity by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents abandon the children due to the rejection of their severe mental or physical disabilities.
It is possible that feral children were subjects of abuse or suffered serious injuries before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some were reportedly raised by animals; it was said that some lived in the wild on their own.
A feral child raised by animals behaves almost in the same way (within the limits of physical capabilities) as the respective animal caretakers, for example, treating humans with fear or indifference.
And while project technologies are meant to make learning simpler and more interesting, scaffolding goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather assistance provided to individuals learning new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real; in other words, the teacher acts as scaffolding, like the little paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in software are designed to prompt, suggest, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to learn independently.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide range of reasons, which can start with neglect and extend to abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up in an environment devoid of care, attention, and upbringing, but they do grow up.
We feel that the foster care system should be a zone of safety for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Foster care should provide everything they lacked in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines both mass media and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as significant motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they explored audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions – facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine if a person is lying through correct interpretation of microexpressions.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately detect sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as pet dogs, might have such abilities in interpreting human behavior.
A study conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genotypic variability: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination change the variation between the two gene pools with each generation.
For primates with a digestive system like that of humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid needs using the available plant resources in the savannah.
Moreover, if this is not done, it will lead to serious consequences: an increase in depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only well-digested but also provides a significant amount of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all these things, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors resolved the "protein question" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during a normal sleep period and falling asleep again after a short interval (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed at the other end of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking a large amount of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is directly opposite to the level of tension in their body and spirit.
The less the tension, the more positive the available life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of achieving enlightenment. The only thing that can hinder the attainment of this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been supplemented with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
On the whole, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With the help of Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) awakens from yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
A central place in Tibetan meditation is occupied by the yoga of deities. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts between systems, processes, and cultures led these countries to become adversaries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, which led to the beginning of the Cold War.
It was supposed to last the next 40 years, and there were real battles between the armies of countries on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans lost their relevance almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the USSR and Poland, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of vessels for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient means of carrying large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the naval forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time creating obstacles to your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany likely would have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that moved across hills and other grazing areas, and were tended by goat herders, often children or teenagers, more commonly known as shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
The cart road was built in England back in the 16th century.
And although the cart roads were essentially two parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses working on them to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads compared to the slightly bumpier ordinary roads of that time.
Sleepers were introduced to hold the tracks in place quite early. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more effective if iron fastenings were installed on top of them.
It became common practice, although the iron caused more wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first fully iron rails appeared.
The first known form of movement was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means the upright walking man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecines, did not walk in an upright position as usual.
Bipedalism is found in the fossil remains of Australopithecus dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have started walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start leading a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it is just like treating the symptoms. However, if we do not seek only a temporary solution, then it is worth finding the root of the problems and eliminating them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing office, located a few blocks away.
During the night, 150-200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. One copy reached London on August 10.
At present, it is known that 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original copy of the manuscript is lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
Their legs have scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all the computers in use today operate by processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In the binary number system, there can only be one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and, to put it in computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The first sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open jar with a medical preparation or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label to obtain specific first aid recommendations for this particular poison.
From a formal point of view, entomologists describe this group of insects with the term beetle.
This term reflects a centuries-old acquaintance with bedbugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both cone-nosed bugs and bed bugs are nest-dwelling insects adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged people, as well as younger individuals.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or not in the interests of their child.
Such parents may decide to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, biological parents are deprived of parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to learn by scientific methods how the world works. This method truly guides most scientific research.
Although it is not only experimentation, an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers, focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were recognized.
As the knowledge of the Greek language waned, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often heavily depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through a biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just a response to external periodic factors, have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a freely running cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment became one of the fundamental hypotheses in the question of whether DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the portion of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning information about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo, as well as obtaining new information about them.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns in their cars to get to their workplaces, while others pass by, heading to work in the places they have just left.
In this dynamic transport flow back and forth, everyone is somehow connected and supports the transportation system that is based on private cars.
Science now notes that this large-scale carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported the evolution of humanity for the past two million years.
Everyone lives in society and uses transportation systems. At the same time, almost everyone complains about them.
You will not often hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints and face failures every day? Could it be that transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the definition of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave quite consistently; thus, traffic flows mostly have some logical sequence and can have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established among three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These ratios help in the planning, design, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
It opens up a wider range of small places for them to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed in his correctness, but many people believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems rational, as we don't feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching a width of 6 miles.
As much as 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed either in size or in the technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the structures of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
In its legislation and official communication, the Vatican uses the Italian language.
Italian is also the language of everyday communication for most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of them can be found in nature in their native form, and it is quite simple to extract them using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or several of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, though he also hypothesized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are primarily a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that will include non-metallic elements, such as carbon in small quantities.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of these particles could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, after its appearance, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods emerged, the status and use of the pencil were diminished.
People now write messages on a computer screen, without any need to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only speculate what the keyboard will become when something newer is invented.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Nuclear fission again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The upper layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The lunar crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
He is thinner beneath the lunar seas and thicker beneath the highlands.
The near side may have more lunar seas because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been adopted by them in the process of growing up.
These theories encompass certain people and what makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment do or do not compel them to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Overall, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to manage their former colleagues. On one hand, they try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of managers has problems with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance results, distributing responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable personality who feels the need to change everything the team has done and do it their own way.
Ultimately, the leader bears full responsibility for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtually created teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as points of contact with their immediate real group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet considering time zones, which may be unclear to their local leaders.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" represents a management group to which all members report. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice could be innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity may emerge.
As a result, the process of joint efforts by the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process to meet the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management needs to create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
"Angel" (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying cognitive abilities. In this way, they narrow the search area and make it more precise.
The researchers in their studies are supported by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important subfield of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptation.
During research in the field of AI, machines are made to automate tasks that require intellectual behavior.
Examples include control, planning and design, the ability to respond to evaluations and client inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines focused on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military because they have been integrated into several applications related to home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important thing in any class. Often the teacher would like to visit places with the students that are impossible to reach by bus.
Technologies offer solutions for virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts or admire beautiful art while sitting together with their class.
A virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned each year, but its old versions are preserved online as an album.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing skills. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers are starting to try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "encourages students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn well beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can identify their positions in the context of others' articles, as well as outline their own views on specific issues (Oravets, 2002).
In Ottawa, the beautiful bilingual capital of Canada, there is a whole range of art galleries and museums that showcase the history and contemporary life of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and areas beyond it.
All these and other things highlight in Ontario what outsiders consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of populations that might surprise many: The US has more African Americans than Canada has its own citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it took strong root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, this region borders the Sahel region, and to the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised for all traveling women to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be appropriate to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what you might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your hand, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The present city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese completely destroyed it and then rebuilt it and called it Casa Branca, but in 1755 they abandoned it after the earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru-al-Baida, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts here gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Not far from the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but this is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
While Goma itself is quite safe, before any travels beyond its borders, it is necessary to study the situation with the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
This city also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and for one of the cheapest gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is about ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because of this, as well as due to its relative inaccessibility, the name "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although it has an airport and attracts tourists with its history.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the major stops during the PBS report Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city sharply contrasts with other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic flavor than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River as the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which hosts various representatives of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, visitors are charged a daily conservation and entry fee.
For someone, it may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to certain parks in South Africa or to all National Parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is a place that attracts special attention from many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the architectural face of Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering histogram, made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon side opposite the harbor.
The vast majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely located on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place appropriated by British colonists, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior regions of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, as they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², about a third of which is covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is believed that about 400 royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer currently inhabit its territory.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days before the trip.
Most districts are served by small Japanese "Koster" buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
A shuttle taxi is a fast and convenient means of traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (150) and Punakha (200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the banks of the Oyapock River and the town of Oyapock in Brazil with the town of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The pylons are 83 meters high, the length of the bridge is 378 meters. It has two lanes for vehicular traffic, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully opened in September 2017 when the Brazilian customs posts are completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who occasionally practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, as a result of clashes between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous peoples, Paraguay was created, which was previously called the "Giant Province of the Indians".
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a significant portion of its indigenous features and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year as well.
Contact the Argentine Polo Association for news regarding tournaments and ticket sales locations for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at parity with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the "FIC West" store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and many establishments also accept Stanley credit cards and US dollars.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although they may take British or United States currencies; confirm with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, there it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are a common occurrence.
Winter can be deceptively cool: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no particular "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are accustomed to people, wild animals are still wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park management's instructions, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors get injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, remember that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so take non-scented food with you and avoid cooking aromatic food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has slightly fewer than 40,000 residents.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor became the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave it.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans perished.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the supreme leader of the Tupu, Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the shore of the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches which are safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly, sometimes crowded beaches with many shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer, "Number One," is simple but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
You can taste many French wines, but New Zealand or Australian wines may better withstand transportation.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. A short black is an "espresso," cappuccino is made with a dollop of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. And the fruit juices are not cheap at all, but they are wonderful.
Many trips to the reef take place year-round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay special attention to danger warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be seen in other months.
Sharks do indeed exist, however, they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not spend much time in the ocean; their main natural habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives the traveler a calm assurance that they will have a place to stay as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often collaborate with specific hotels, although you might try booking other accommodations with them, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer service packages that include breakfast, airport transfer arrangements, or even combined packages of flights and hotel services.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your trip (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests must still go through the travel agency first, rather than directly through the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a significant majority of music event attendees decide to spend the night on site, and for most visitors, this is an important part of the adventure.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to get a seat nearer to the stage.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has stopped playing, there may be sections at the festival that will play music until late at night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the cabin's location because the journey through ice causes quite a terrifying sound if you are very close to its source.
Cruises to St. Petersburg provide for spending time in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are typically absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and indoors.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication negatively affects the ability to assess situations, so all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and it is not permissible to drive as if on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck in it.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or the formation of water or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues without obstacles all year round.
A safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, which draws the attention of many visitors.
The term safari generally refers to an overland trip to admire the incredible African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely, so standard equipment will allow you to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be skittish, and it's better to observe them with binoculars.
A safari walk (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "journey on foot") is a hike lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the tournaments will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked airline tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation orders differ, but by the end of March, most cancellation orders due to the coronavirus have not been extended to July 2020 – the time when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most of the event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets priced at around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. In many hotels, an iron and ironing board can be rented, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (as this may cause shrinkage, or in the worst case, scorching).
There are different methods of water purification, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it's enough to boil water for a minute, in others, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters can vary. If you are experiencing problems, it might be worth considering purchasing water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they have not heard of in their native places.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person, are usually not considered as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on items such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most difficult section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, as it often runs through isolated forest wilderness.
If you are unfamiliar with rural roads, keep in mind that they are dominated by steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is extremely important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, however, the mobile connection here is much better than on many other segments of the route, for example, in "Pennsylvania Wilds".
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and diverse, similar to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are quite common: apples are used in baking all year round, while cherries and plums are used in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular pies will often be particularly delicious with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but tasty pastry, try what is called "Berliner," "Pfannkuchen," or "Krapfen," depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Caries can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of fluid.
In the interior regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally added to curry; in Southern India and sometimes in other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is traditionally added.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
But, if used without additional clarifications, this term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now very common throughout the archipelago and offers a wide selection of simply seasoned dishes, among which the predominant flavors are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), along with a variety of fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability but can be dangerous because of the potential for the rider's foot to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off by a horse and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, the horse might run and drag them. To reduce the risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, fairly narrow soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety measures that allow the stirrup with the strap to detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it along.
The Cochamó Valley, with its variety of high granite climbs and cliffs, is a premier rock climbing destination in Chile, also known as the Yosemite of South America.
Ascents include admiring breathtaking views from the summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes amidst the endless potential of the walls.
Skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope on skis or a snowboard that are attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities that many enthusiasts engage in, sometimes referred to as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient — cave paintings dating back to 5000 B.C. depict skiers!
The sport of alpine skiing was established no later than the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first health ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: this activity is also called ski touring, ski tourism, or ski hiking.
It is related but usually does not include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering; the latter are conducted on steep slopes and require the use of stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route similar to a hiking route.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to travel longer distances than on foot – but you will really rarely be able to reach cross-country skiing speed without a heavy backpack on well-maintained routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with a large number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean multiple visa procedures and passport controls.
However, in this sense, the Schengen Area operates as if it were one country.
By staying in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to obtain visas separately for each of the countries in the Schengen Area, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for items that qualify as antiques. Some tax agencies classify goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition varies depending on the geographic location – the age limit in North America, for example, may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be classified as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many who have other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, usually keeping reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern commerce. Tourism in Sápmi, where the Sámi live, brings in significant income.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and the mistaken perception of these people.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes the subject of government travel advisories, it may affect your travel medical insurance and cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the governments of countries other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Newsletters provide only brief information about the political situation in the country.
The presented data is often superficial, generalized, and very simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather conditions is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can potentially cause damage, lead to serious social disruptions, or result in death.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they come in different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and forest fires are types and consequences of bad weather, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of adverse weather conditions in their area, as they may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
An Internet search for the "Hostile Environment" course is likely to provide the address of a local company.
As a rule, all the issues discussed here are covered in much more detail in the course, usually with practical sessions.
As a rule, the course lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid training, and sometimes firearms training.
Books and magazines that tell about desert survival are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
Tourists planning a gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender designation (X) or documents updated with the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to consider such documents is also very varied.
Searches at checkpoints also became more rigorous in the era following the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are reverse flows from waves that break on the shore, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in several deeper areas, and a rapid current can form there into deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue when trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will be no harder than usual.
Try to head to a place where you will not get caught in the current again or, depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, it might be better to wait for rescue.
The shock of re-entry occurs earlier than culture shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Those travelers who had no problems adapting to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are already adapted to the new culture and have lost certain habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are just as necessary for travelers when returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting events for children in this area.
You will be able to see the pyramids in the dark, and you will be able to see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and traders. The history of sound and light is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx serves as a background decoration and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are reflected on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by several countries, have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano forms the basis of an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a territory on the southern part of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains here converge into a plateau, and then reemerge, forming the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth mountain range, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains of Antarctica: the Vinson Massif and Mount Vinson, which reaches a height of 4,892 meters.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used on vessels, including pleasure boats and expeditions, which require remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider should provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning an academic leave is travel and study.
This practice is particularly popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, studying abroad during an academic leave can indeed improve your chances of getting into a university in your country.
Usually, such educational programs are paid.
Finland is a wonderful place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also encompasses thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are actually big enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, considering that there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but overall quite a unique phenomenon (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure is one in forty).
Most of these remarkable Baltic Sea cruises are characterized by prolonged stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend a few full days at a historical site, returning to the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (valid as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the cost of the cruise.
Air travel can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced traumatic events.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it has no difference from personal fears or disgust towards other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on ignorance or lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast delivery of items. Most often, time is very important when it comes to the delivery of business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On certain routes, larger companies have their own airplanes, but in the case of other routes, smaller firms have encountered a problem.
If they were shipping things by air, on some routes, unloading and customs clearance would take several days.
The only way to do it quickly was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
To fly in first or business class, obviously, you have to fork over a hefty stack of cash for this privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it is quite expensive: generally, you can expect to pay four times the standard economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Overall, on direct flights from point A to point B, there is no point in looking for discounts on business class or first-class seats.
Airlines know well that there is a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay the maximum amount for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly for it.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million people, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, business and commercial center, located around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers intermingle with traditional red-roofed houses, an 18th-century bazaar, and ancient mosques and churches, though the city's atmosphere resembles Mediterranean Europe more than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, there is a view of the neighboring island of Eysturoy, and it also features an unusual octagonal church.
On the churchyard, interesting marble sculptures of doves have been installed over some tombs.
It is worth strolling around the intriguing village for at least half an hour.
To the north and easily accessible is the romantic and exciting city of Sintra, which became widely known to foreigners after an enthusiastic review of its splendor written by Lord Byron.
You can regularly take the Scotturb 403 bus to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Brothers of the Temple), a place known worldwide for the apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass burial site, as well as a place that holds tremendous significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived imprisonment here, and even more whose loved ones were killed here or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not defile the place by marking or graffiti on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Nearly half prefer speaking Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, while unscheduled disruptions are announced by the automatic system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known as egocentric, rude, and arrogant people.
Overall, it is nothing more than a false stereotype, yet the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will greatly simplify the journey.
The severity of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show a little common respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily overgrown with forest, mainly beech, pine, and spruce, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptional variety of plant species due to different microclimates and soil types, as well as varying altitudes.
This area is also home to an exceptionally wide variety of animal and bird species.
Here one can encounter rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, as well as many other well-known species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and have covered shoulders.
Most monasteries provide cloaks for women who come unprepared, but if you come with your own, especially in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
They can also be borrowed from the warehouse near the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after each user, so you might find it unpleasant to wear these clothes. One size fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa Amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie meaning you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
Perhaps it also facilitates reading, although writing becomes somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in the Italian language is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced the same way they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowels.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, and carro is a chariot.
The Persian language has relatively easy and mostly correct grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who have some knowledge of Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is quite similar to it and does not need to be studied separately.
Today, ancient observatories are generally outdated and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, making them easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Most modern telescopes for scientific research are huge structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor at the Imperial Palace exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to destroy even "just one" specimen.
If you visit an officially designed garden, collecting "samples" will also result in expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally an exceptionally safe place and very easy to navigate, where you can buy virtually anything you want after arrival.
Yet, being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (always) and the blazing sun (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Internal waterways can be a great idea for spending a vacation.
Let's say, visit the castles in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley, or go on a cruise to interesting places on the Danube River, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also determine routes for popular walking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night without sleep in some open place to see the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter service on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and believers often start the celebration at midnight to mark the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands got here either by water or by air.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
After humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals appeared there, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will discover the polar night, when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not an issue, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what residents of Western countries are accustomed to.
The standard business attire is suits. Employees address each other by surname or job title.
A prominent place is given to harmony in the work environment, with the efforts of the group being valued above personal achievements.
Employees often need to obtain approval from their supervisor for any decisions, and they are also expected to adhere unquestioningly to the instructions of their managers.
